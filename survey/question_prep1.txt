825<entry>At that time I stated the principles upon which I believed action should be taken in respect to the tariff An effective tariff upon agricultural products , that will compensate the farmer s higher costs and higher standards of living , has a dual purpose.<entry>Such a tariff not only protects the farmer in our domestic market but it also stimulates him to diversify his crops and to grow products that he could not otherwise produce , and thus lessens his dependence upon exports to foreign markets.<entry>The tariff upon agricultural products, that will compensate the farmer s higher costs and higher standards of living, has a dual purpose.<entry>It is a means of ensuring that the farmer s lower costs and lower standards of living are compensated for.<entry>Business payments made gratifying indication that progress has been made on the fourth of july last.<entry> It will give him the opportunity for the farmer to spend more time on his very own farm <entry>It is to provide an incentive for the farmer to produce more crops and increase his own production.
