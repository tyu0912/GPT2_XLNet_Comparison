result , however , consists in the fact that the destruction of our public forests by depredation , although such cases still occur , has been greatly reduced in extent , and it is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress such trespasses , at least those on a large scale , can be entirely suppressed , except in the

destruction of the forests.<entry>In view of the fact that the present policy is in effect, the question whether the Government should continue to maintain its present policy of keeping the forests in
