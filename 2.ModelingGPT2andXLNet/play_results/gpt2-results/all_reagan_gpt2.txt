President,  Ford,  Vice President,  Vice President-to-be, the distinguished guests here, you ladies and gentlemen. | They ought to take this whole thing with them.
I was going to say fellow Republicans here but those who are watching from a distance, all those millions of Democrats and independents who I know are looking for a cause around which to rally and which I believe we can give them. | You've got to know that they have not, and they haven't figured out a way to fund the next three years in which to do what we've done and that's to mobilize and defend our principles of standing with our party.
President, before you arrive tonight, these wonderful people, here, when we came in, gave Nancy and myself a welcome. | Thank you, all the way.
That, plus this, plus your kindness and generosity in honoring us by bringing us down here will give us a memory that will live in our hearts forever. | Thank you, Sixtus

Mamada LamoraThis week I finally found my dog and will get her back into the house, hopefully one day soon! Please welcome to Coggie, one of my favorite strips here on the Web.
Watching on television these last few nights I have seen also the warmth with which you greeted Nancy and you also filled my heart with joy when you did that. | I wish I could say that this time I have been only 5 months pregnant.
