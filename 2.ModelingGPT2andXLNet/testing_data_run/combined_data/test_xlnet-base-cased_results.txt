We have recommended that the price , for instance , of new natural gas be raised each year to the average price of domestic oil that would produce the same amount of energy.|With this new policy , the gross income of gas producers would average about 2 billion each year more than at the present price level.|This would be a significant step in the development of the gas market.

The bank as proposed to be constituted can not be relied on during the war to provide a circulating medium nor to furnish loans or antici pations of the public revenue.|Without a medium the taxes can not be collected , and in the absence of specie the medium understood to be the best substitute is that of notes issued by a national bank.|It is a "public trust" and it has to be administered by a competent and independent body of public officials.
Without a medium the taxes can not be collected , and in the absence of specie the medium understood to be the best substitute is that of notes issued by a national bank.|The proposed bank will commence and conduct its operations under an obligation to pay its notes in specie , or be subject to the loss of its charter.|In addition to the currency used, there are also various mediums of exchange.
The proposed bank will commence and conduct its operations under an obligation to pay its notes in specie , or be subject to the loss of its charter.|Without such an obligation the notes of the bank , though not exchangeable for specie , yet resting on good pledges and performing the uses of specie in the payment of taxes and in other public transactions , would , as experience has ascertained , qualify the bank to supply at once a circulating medium and pecuniary aids to the Government.|In addition, it will be subject to the loss of its bond.
Without such an obligation the notes of the bank , though not exchangeable for specie , yet resting on good pledges and performing the uses of specie in the payment of taxes and in other public transactions , would , as experience has ascertained , qualify the bank to supply at once a circulating medium and pecuniary aids to the Government.|Under the fetters imposed by the bill it is manifest that during the actual state of things , and probably during the war , the period particularly requiring such a medium and such a resource for loans and advances to the Government , notes for which the bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange could not be kept in circulation.|In this way the bank would be able to supply both a monetary and a circulating medium.

The most the bank could effect , and the most it could be expected to aim at , would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local transactions which , with the interest on the public stock in the bank , might yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose until a change from war to peace should enable it , by a flow of specie into its vaults and a removal of the external demand for it , to derive its contemplated emoluments from a safe and full extension of its operations.|On the whole , when it is considered that the proposed establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a national bank for a period of twenty years that the monopolized profits will be continually growing with the progress of the national population and wealth that the nation will during the same period be dependent on the notes of the bank for that species of circulating medium whenever the precious metals may be wanted , and at all times for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium , and that the extensive employment of the notes in the collection of the augmented taxes will , moreover , enable the bank greatly to extend its profitable issues of them without the expense of specie capital to support their circulation , it is as reasonable as it is requisite that the Government , in return for these extraordinary concessions to the bank , should have a greater security for attaining the public objects of the institution than is presented in the bill , and particularly for every practicable accommodation , both in the temporary advances necessary to anticipate the taxes and in those more durable loans which are equally necessary to diminish the resort to taxes.|".

In discharging this painful duty of stating objections to a measure which has undergone the deliberations and received the sanction of the two Houses of the National Legislature I console myself with the reflection that if they have not the weight which I attach to them they can be constitutionally overruled , and with a confidence that in a contrary event the wisdom of Congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigencies.|JAMES MADISON.|I also take the liberty of expressing my own opinion on the question of the validity of the enactment of a new act of Parliament.
