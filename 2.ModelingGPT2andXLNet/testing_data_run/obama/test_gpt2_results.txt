What do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy.|So we have to move in that direction.|The American people are not going to let the Obama administration dictate the direction of the world.
So we have to move in that direction.|What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth , produce jobs , make sure our businesses are competitive around the world , that we are going to need some of the old , traditional energy sources as we are developing these new ones and ramping them up.|"We have to move in that direction.

So we cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy.|That just cannot happen.|We have to be able to adapt to the changing climate and to the changing economy.
That just cannot happen.|We are going to have needs in these traditional sources.|I have to be careful.
We are going to have needs in these traditional sources.|And so the question then is , are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe , secure nuclear power that includes new technologies so that we can use coal which we have in abundance and is very cheap , but often is adding to our greenhouse gases can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy.|We're going to have a problem with the way we're going to use them," said Mr.

And my hope is that my Republican friends , but also Democrats , say to themselves , let us be practical and let us do both.|Let us not just do one or the other let us do both.|We have to get out of this political circus and let's be realistic and let's not let our party get in the way of what we want.
Let us not just do one or the other let us do both.|Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix.|We should not just do the other.
Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix.|But we have got to do both.|I think we're going to see more and more energy efficiency and more efficient power generation.
But we have got to do both.|I am just a eternal optimist and so it is the right thing to do.|We have got to get rid of this nonsense and get rid of the whole thing that's been going on.
I am just a eternal optimist and so it is the right thing to do.|And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what is right for the country and assume that over time people , regardless of party , regardless of their particular political positions , are going to gravitate towards the truth.|But I also believe that if you are a Christian and you believe in God, then you should also be a Christian.
And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what is right for the country and assume that over time people , regardless of party , regardless of their particular political positions , are going to gravitate towards the truth.|Okay I am going to take two more.|The fact that the US government is so willing to use the power of the internet to censor and censor the internet is a sign that the US is not a democracy, and the US is not a democracy at all.

Why is everybody moaning about Todd Well , it is moving along fairly quickly.|I think that we have bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can align themselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community.|The problem with the whole idea of "we're not going to get it" is that the only way we can make it happen is if we can get the money.

They rejected it although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it is not always clear who is speaking on behalf of the government , and we get a lot of different , mixed signals.|But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept.|The first thing to note is that the government has been in a state of crisis since last week.
But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept.|That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.|The question of Iran's willingness to accept the agreement is not one that is going to be resolved by a vote of Congress, but rather, is one that will have a significant impact on the international order.
That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.|And that is not acceptable to the international community , not just to the United States.|The nuclear power industry is not a threat, and the threat is not to the United States, but to the world.
And that is not acceptable to the international community , not just to the United States.|So what we have said from the start was we are moving on dual tracks.|It is unacceptable to the United Nations.

One thing I am pleased about is to see how forward leaning the Russians have been on this issue.|I think they clearly have seen that Iran has not been serious about solving what is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community.|I think it's important to note that this is the first time that the US has been able to get the Russian side to do something about it.
I think they clearly have seen that Iran has not been serious about solving what is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community.|All right I am going to make this the last question.|"I think the Iranian leadership has been very clear about that and that is what they want.

I do not know if anybody noticed that for the first time this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the private sector not because of anything we did , but because more and more people are losing their health care from their employers.|It is becoming unaffordable.|I don't know if anyone noticed that for the first time this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the private sector not because of anything we did, but because more and more people are losing their health care from their employers.
It is becoming unaffordable.|That is what we are trying to prevent.|The government has already cut the number of public schools by half.
That is what we are trying to prevent.|We want people to be able to get health care from their employers.|We are trying to prevent the spread of diseases.
