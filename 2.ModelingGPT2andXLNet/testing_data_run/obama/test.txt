Good evening.
To the United States Corps of Cadets , to the men and women of our Armed Services , and to my fellow Americans I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan the nature of our commitment there , the scope of our interests , and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion.
It is an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security , and to represent what is finest about our country.
To address these important issues , it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place.
We did not ask for this fight.
On September 11 , 2001 , 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3 , 000 people.
They struck at our military and economic nerve centers.
They took the lives of innocent men , women , and children without regard to their faith or race or station.
Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers onboard one of those flights , they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington , and killed many more.
As we know , these men belonged to al Qaeda a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam , one of the world s great religions , to justify the slaughter of innocents.
Al Qaeda s base of operations was in Afghanistan , where they were harbored by the Taliban a ruthless , repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war , and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere.
Just days after 9 11 , Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them an authorization that continues to this day.
The vote in the Senate was 98 to nothing.
The vote in the House was 420 to 1.
For the first time in its history , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all.
And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9 11 attacks.
America , our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda s terrorist network and to protect our common security.
Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden we sent our troops into Afghanistan.
Within a matter of months , al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed.
The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels.
A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope.
At a conference convened by the N.
, a provisional government was established under President Hamid Karzai.
And an International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war torn country.
Then , in early 2003 , the decision was made to wage a second war , in Iraq.
The wrenching debate over the Iraq war is well known and need not be repeated here.
It is enough to say that for the next six years , the Iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops , our resources , our diplomacy , and our national attention and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world.
Today , after extraordinary costs , we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end.
We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer , and all of our troops by the end of 2011.
That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and women in uniform.
Thanks to their courage , grit and perseverance , we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future , and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.
But while we have achieved hard earned milestones in Iraq , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated.
After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002 , al Qaeda s leadership established a safe haven there.
Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people , it is been hampered by corruption , the drug trade , an under developed economy , and insufficient security forces.
Over the last several years , the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda , as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government.
Gradually , the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory in Afghanistan , while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorism against the Pakistani people.
Now , throughout this period , our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq.
When I took office , we had just over 32 , 000 Americans serving in Afghanistan , compared to 160 , 000 in Iraq at the peak of the war.
Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban , but these reinforcements did not arrive.
And that is why , shortly after taking office , I approved a longstanding request for more troops.
After consultations with our allies , I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan.
I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting , dismantling , and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies , and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts.
Since then , we have made progress on some important objectives.
High ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed , and we have stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda worldwide.
In Pakistan , that nation s army has gone on its largest offensive in years.
In Afghanistan , we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election , and although it was marred by fraud that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan s laws and constitution.
Yet huge challenges remain.
Afghanistan is not lost , but for several years it has moved backwards.
There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown , but the Taliban has gained momentum.
Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9 11 , but they retain their safe havens along the border.
And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population.
Our new commander in Afghanistan General McChrystal has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated.
In short The status quo is not sustainable.
As cadets , you volunteered for service during this time of danger.
Some of you fought in Afghanistan.
Some of you will deploy there.
As your Commander in Chief , I owe you a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of your service.
And that is why , after the Afghan voting was completed , I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy.
Now , let me be clear There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 , so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period.
Instead , the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions , and to explore all the different options , along with my national security team , our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan , and our key partners.
And given the stakes involved , I owed the American people and our troops no less.
This review is now complete.
And as Commander in Chief , I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30 , 000 troops to Afghanistan.
After 18 months , our troops will begin to come home.
These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative , while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan.
I do not make this decision lightly.
I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force , and always consider the long term consequences of our actions.
We have been at war now for eight years , at enormous cost in lives and resources.
Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters , and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort.
And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.
Most of all , I know that this decision asks even more of you a military that , along with your families , has already borne the heaviest of all burdens.
As President , I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars.
I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed.
I visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed.
I have traveled to Dover to meet the flag draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place.
I see firsthand the terrible wages of war.
If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan , I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.
So , no , I do not make this decision lightly.
I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda.
It is from here that we were attacked on 9 11 , and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak.
This is no idle danger no hypothetical threat.
In the last few months alone , we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror.
And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards , and al Qaeda can operate with impunity.
We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and to do that , we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.
Of course , this burden is not ours alone to bear.
This is not just America s war.
Since 9 11 , al Qaeda s safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali.
The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered.
And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear armed Pakistan , because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons , and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.
These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies.
Our overarching goal remains the same to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future.
To meet that goal , we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan.
We must deny al Qaeda a safe haven.
We must reverse the Taliban s momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government.
And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan s security forces and government so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan s future.
We will meet these objectives in three ways.
First , we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban s momentum and increase Afghanistan s capacity over the next 18 months.
The 30 , 000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 the fastest possible pace so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers.
They will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces , and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight.
And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.
Because this is an international effort , I have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies.
Some have already provided additional troops , and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead.
Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan.
And now , we must come together to end this war successfully.
For what is at stake is not simply a test of NATO s credibility what is at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world.
But taken together , these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces , and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011.
Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly , taking into account conditions on the ground.
We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul.
But it will be clear to the Afghan government and , more importantly , to the Afghan people that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.
Second , we will work with our partners , the United Nations , and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy , so that the government can take advantage of improved security.
This effort must be based on performance.
The days of providing a blank check are over.
President Karzai s inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction.
And going forward , we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance.
We will support Afghan ministries , governors , and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people.
We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable.
And we will also focus our assistance in areas such as agriculture that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people.
The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades.
They have been confronted with occupation by the Soviet Union , and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes.
So tonight , I want the Afghan people to understand America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering.
We have no interest in occupying your country.
We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens.
And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the day when our troops will leave and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner , and never your patron.
Third , we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan.
We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country.
But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan.
That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.
In the past , there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight , and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence.
But in recent years , as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad , it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism.
Public opinion has turned.
The Pakistani army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan.
And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy.
In the past , we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly.
Those days are over.
Moving forward , we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interest , mutual respect , and mutual trust.
We will strengthen Pakistan s capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries , and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear.
America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan s democracy and development.
We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting.
And going forward , the Pakistan people must know America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan s security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent , so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.
These are the three core elements of our strategy a military effort to create the conditions for a transition a civilian surge that reinforces positive action and an effective partnership with Pakistan.
I recognize there are a range of concerns about our approach.
So let me briefly address a few of the more prominent arguments that I have heard , and which I take very seriously.
First , there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam.
They argue that it cannot be stabilized , and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing.
I believe this argument depends on a false reading of history.
Unlike Vietnam , we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action.
Unlike Vietnam , we are not facing a broad based popular insurgency.
And most importantly , unlike Vietnam , the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.
To abandon this area now and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.
Second , there are those who acknowledge that we cannot leave Afghanistan in its current state , but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have.
But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through , and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there.
It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan , because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.
Finally , there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility.
Indeed , some call for a more dramatic and open ended escalation of our war effort one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade.
I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost , and what we need to achieve to secure our interests.
Furthermore , the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government.
It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security , and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.
As President , I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility , our means , or our interests.
And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces.
I do not have the luxury of committing to just one.
Indeed , I am mindful of the words of President Eisenhower , who in discussing our national security said , Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.
Over the past several years , we have lost that balance.
We have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy.
In the wake of an economic crisis , too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills.
Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children.
Meanwhile , competition within the global economy has grown more fierce.
So we cannot simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.
All told , by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars.
Going forward , I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly.
Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion for the military this year , and I will work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.
But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility , we must rebuild our strength here at home.
Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power.
It pays for our military.
It underwrites our diplomacy.
It taps the potential of our people , and allows investment in new industry.
And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last.
That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open ended because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own.
Now , let me be clear None of this will be easy.
The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly , and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan.
It will be an enduring test of our free society , and our leadership in the world.
And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century , our effort will involve disorderly regions , failed states , diffuse enemies.
So as a result , America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict not just how we wage wars.
We will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power.
Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships.
And we cannot count on military might alone.
We have to invest in our homeland security , because we cannot capture or kill every violent extremist abroad.
We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence , so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.
We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction.
And that is why I have made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists , to stop the spread of nuclear weapons , and to pursue the goal of a world without them because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapons true security will come for those who reject them.
We will have to use diplomacy , because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone.
I have spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships.
And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim world one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict , and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity.
And finally , we must draw on the strength of our values for the challenges that we face may have changed , but the things that we believe in must not.
That is why we must promote our values by living them at home which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.
And we must make it clear to every man , woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights , and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples.
That is who we are.
That is the source , the moral source , of America s authority.
Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt , and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great grandparents , our country has borne a special burden in global affairs.
We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents.
We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies.
We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.
We have not always been thanked for these efforts , and we have at times made mistakes.
But more than any other nation , the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades a time that , for all its problems , has seen walls come down , and markets open , and billions lifted from poverty , unparalleled scientific progress and advancing frontiers of human liberty.
For unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought world domination.
Our union was founded in resistance to oppression.
We do not seek to occupy other nations.
We will not claim another nation s resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours.
What we have fought for what we continue to fight for is a better future for our children and grandchildren.
And we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity.
As a country , we are not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Roosevelt was President.
Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom.
And now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.
In the end , our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms.
It derives from our people from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries from the teachers that will educate our children , and the service of those who work in our communities at home from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people , by the people , and for the people a reality on this Earth.
This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue nor should we.
But I also know that we , as a country , cannot sustain our leadership , nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time , if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse.
It is easy to forget that when this war began , we were united bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack , and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear.
I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again.
I believe with every fiber of my being that we as Americans can still come together behind a common purpose.
For our values are not simply words written into parchment they are a creed that calls us together , and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation , as one people.
America we are passing through a time of great trial.
And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear that our cause is just , our resolve unwavering.
We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might , and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer , a world that is more secure , and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes.
Thank you.
God bless you.
May God bless the United States of America.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
.
Madam Speaker , Vice President Biden , Members of Congress , and the American people When I spoke here last winter , this Nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
We were losing an average of 700 , 000 jobs per month , credit was frozen , and our financial system was on the verge of collapse.
Now , as any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you , we are by no means out of the woods.
A full and vibrant recovery is still many months away.
And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them , until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive , until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes.
That is our ultimate goal.
But thanks to the bold and decisive action we have taken since January , I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink.
I want to thank the Members of this body for your efforts and your support in these last several months , and especially those who have taken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery.
I also want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve during this trying time for our Nation.
But we did not come here just to clean up crises.
We came here to build a future.
So tonight , I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future , and that is the issue of health care.
I am not the first President to take up this cause , but I am determined to be the last.
It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform , and ever since , nearly every President and Congress , whether Democrat or Republican , has attempted to meet this challenge in some way.
A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell , , in 1943.
Sixty five years later , his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.
Our collective failure to meet this challenge , year after year , decade after decade , has led us to the breaking point.
Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy.
These are not primarily people on welfare these are middle class Americans.
Some cannot get insurance on the job.
Others are self employed and cannot afford it since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer.
Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or too expensive to cover.
We are the only democracy the only advanced democracy on Earth the only wealthy nation that allows such hardship for millions of its people.
There are now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage.
In just a 2 year period , one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point.
And every day , 14 , 000 Americans lose their coverage.
In other words , it can happen to anyone.
But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem for the uninsured.
Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today.
More and more Americans worry that if you move , lose your job , or change your job , you will lose your health insurance too.
More and more Americans pay their premiums only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick or will not pay the full cost of care.
It happens every day.
One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he had not reported gallstones that he did not even know about.
They delayed his treatment , and he died because of it.
Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.
By the time she had her insurance reinstated , her breast cancer had more than doubled in size.
That is heart breaking , it is wrong , and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.
Then there is the problem of rising cost.
We spend one and a half times more per person on health care than any other country , but we are not any healthier for it.
This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages.
It is why so many employers , especially small businesses , are forcing their employers employees to pay more for insurance or are dropping their coverage entirely.
It is why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place and why American businesses that compete internationally , like our automakers , are at a huge disadvantage.
And it is why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it , about 1 , 000 per year that pays for somebody else s emergency room and charitable care.
Finally , our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers.
When health care costs grow at the rate they have , it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs , we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other Government program combined.
Put simply , our health care problem is our deficit problem.
Nothing else even comes close.
Nothing else.
Now , these are the facts.
Nobody disputes them.
We know we must reform this system.
The question is how.
Now , there are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single payer system like Canada s , where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the Government provide coverage for everybody.
On the right , there are those who argue that we should end employer based systems and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own.
I have said I have to say that there are arguments to be made for both these approaches.
But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have.
Since health care represents one sixth of our economy , I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what does not , rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch.
And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the several past several months.
During that time , we have seen Washington at its best and at its worst.
We have seen many in this Chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform.
Of the five committees asked to develop bills , four have completed their work , and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week.
That has never happened before.
Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses , hospitals , seniors groups , and even drug companies , many of whom opposed reform in the past.
And there is agreement in this Chamber on about 80 percent of what needs to be done , putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.
But what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have towards their own government.
Instead of honest debate , we have seen scare tactics.
Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise.
Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short term political points , even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long term challenge.
And out of this blizzard of charges and countercharges , confusion has reigned.
Well , the time for bickering is over.
The time for games has passed.
Now is the season for action.
Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do.
Now is the time to deliver on health care.
Now is the time to deliver on health care.
The plan I am announcing tonight would meet three basic goals It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance it will provide insurance for those who do not and it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families , our businesses , and our Government.
It is a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge , not just government , not just insurance companies , but everybody , including employers and individuals.
And it is a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen , from Democrats and Republicans , and yes , from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.
Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan.
First , if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job or Medicare or Medicaid or the Vnothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have.
Let me repeat this Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.
What this plan will do is make the insurance you have work better for you.
Under this plan , it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition.
As soon as I sign this bill , it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it the most.
They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or in a lifetime.
We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out of pocket expenses , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they get sick.
And insurance companies will be required to cover , with no extra charge , routine checkups and preventive care , like mammograms and colonoscopies , because there is no reason we should not be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse.
That makes sense , it saves money , and it saves lives.
Now , that is what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan , more security and more stability.
Now , if you are one of the tens of millions of Americans who do not currently have health insurance , the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality , affordable choices.
If you lose your job or you change your job , you will be able to get coverage.
If you strike out on your own and start a small business , you will be able to get coverage.
We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange , a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices.
Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers.
As one big group , these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage.
This is how large companies and Government employees get affordable insurance , it is how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance , and it is time to give every American the same opportunity that we give ourselves.
Now , for those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower priced insurance available in the exchange , we will provide tax credits , the size of which will be based on your need.
And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned.
This exchange will take effect in 4 years , which will give us time to do it right.
In the meantime , for those Americans who cannot get insurance today because they have preexisting medical conditions , we will immediately offer low cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill.
This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign , it is a good idea now , and we should all embrace it.
Now , even if we provide these affordable options , there may be those , especially the young and the healthy , who still want to take the risk and go without coverage.
There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers by giving them coverage.
The problem is , such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money.
If there are affordable options and people still do not sign up for health insurance , it means we pay for these people s expensive emergency room visits.
If some businesses do not provide workers health care , it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors.
And unless everybody does their part , many of the insurance reforms we seek , especially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions , just cannot be achieved.
And that is why under my plan , individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance , just as most States require you to carry auto insurance.
Likewise , businesses will be required to either offer their workers health care or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers.
There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still cannot afford coverage , and 95 percent of all small businesses , because of their size and narrow profit margin , would be exempt from these requirements.
But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees.
Improving our health care system only works if everybody does their part.
And while there remain some significant details to be ironed out , I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined consumer protections for those with insurance , an exchange that allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable coverage , and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance.
And I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life as well as the economy as a whole.
Still , given all the misinformation that is been spread over the past few months , I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform.
So tonight I want to address some of the key controversies that are still out there.
Some of people s concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost.
The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts , but by prominent politicians , that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens.
Now , such a charge would be laughable if it were not so cynical and irresponsible.
It is a lie , plain and simple.
Now , there are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants.
This too is false.
The reforms I am proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
Representative Joe Wilson.
You lie The President.
It is not true.
And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up , under our plan , no Federal dollars will be used to fund abortions , and Federal conscience laws will remain in place.
Now , my health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a Government takeover of the entire health care system.
As proof , critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly sponsored insurance option , administered by the Government just like Medicaid or Medicare.
So let me set the record straight here.
My guiding principle is , and always has been , that consumers do better when there is choice and competition.
That is how the market works.
Unfortunately , in 34 States , 75 percent of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies.
In Alabama , almost 90 percent is controlled by just one company.
And without competition , the price of insurance goes up and quality goes down.
And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly by cherry picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest , by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage , and by jacking up rates.
Insurance executives do not do this because they are bad people they do it because it is profitable.
As one former insurance executive testified before Congress , insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill , they are rewarded for it.
All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called Wall Street s relentless profit expectations.
Now , I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of business.
They provide a legitimate service and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors.
I just want to hold them accountable.
And the insurance reforms that I have already mentioned would do just that.
But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not for profit public option available in the insurance exchange.
Now , let me be clear.
Let me be clear.
It would only be an option for those who do not have insurance.
No one would be forced to choose it , and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance.
In fact , based on Congressional Budget Office estimates , we believe that less than 5 percent of Americans would sign up.
Despite all this , the insurance companies and their allies do not like this idea.
They argue that these private companies cannot fairly compete with the Government.
And they had be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option.
But they will not be.
I have insisted that like any private insurance company , the public insurance option would have to be self sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects.
But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits and excessive administrative costs and executive salaries , it could provide a good deal for consumers and would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better , the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.
Now , it is worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I have proposed tonight.
But its impact should not be exaggerated by the left or the right or the media.
It is only one part of my plan and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles.
To my progressive friends , I would remind you that for decades , the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage available for those without it.
The public option is only a means to that end , and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal.
And to my Republican friends , I say that rather than making wild claims about a Government takeover of health care , we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have.
Now , for example , some have suggested that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies.
Others have proposed a co op or another nonprofit entity to administer the plan.
These are all constructive ideas worth exploring.
But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans cannot find affordable coverage , we will provide you with a choice.
And I will make sure that no Government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.
Finally , let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me , to Members of this Chamber , and to the public , and that is how we pay for this plan.
And here s what you need to know.
First , I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits , either now or in the future.
I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit , now or in the future , period.
And to prove that I am serious , there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we have promised do not materialize.
Now , part of the reason I faced a trillion dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for , from the Iraq war to tax breaks for the wealthy.
I will not make that same mistake with health care.
Second , we have estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system , a system that is currently full of waste and abuse.
Right now , too much of the hard earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care do not make us any healthier.
That is not my judgment it is the judgment of medical professionals across this country.
And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid.
In fact , I want to speak directly to seniors for a moment , because Medicare is another issue that is been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.
More than four decades ago , this Nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work , our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years.
That is how Medicare was born , and it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next.
And that is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.
The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies , subsidies that do everything to pad their profits but do not improve the care of seniors.
And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.
Now , these steps will ensure that you , America s seniors , get the benefits you have been promised.
They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations.
And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pockets for prescription drugs.
That is what this plan will do for you.
So do not pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut , especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past and just this year supported a budget that would essentially have turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program.
That will not happen on my watch.
I will protect Medicare.
Now , because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system , making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody.
We have long known that some places , like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania , offer high quality care at costs below average.
So the commission can help encourage the adoption of these commonsense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system , everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors.
Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan.
Now , much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers.
And this reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies , which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money , an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts.
And according to these same experts , this modest change could help hold down the costs of health care for all of us in the long run.
Now , finally , many in this Chamber , particularly on the Republican side of the aisle , have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care.
Now there you go.
There you go.
Now , I do not believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet , but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.
So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine.
I know that the Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual States to test these ideas.
I think it is a good idea , and I am directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today.
Now , add it all up , and the plan I am proposing will cost around 900 billion over 10 years , less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration.
Now , most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent , but spent badly , in the existing health care system.
The plan will not add to our deficit.
The middle class will realize greater security , not higher taxes.
And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one tenth of 1 percent each year one tenth of 1 percent it will actually reduce the deficit by 4 trillion over the long term.
Now , this is the plan I am proposing.
It is a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight , Democrats and Republicans.
And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead.
If you come to me with a serious set of proposals , I will be there to listen.
My door is always open.
But know this I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it is better politics to kill this plan than to improve it.
I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are.
If you misrepresent what is in this plan , we will call you out.
And I will not accept the status quo as a solution.
Not this time.
Not now.
Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing.
Our deficit will grow , more families will go bankrupt , more businesses will close , more Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it the most , and more will die as a result.
We know these things to be true.
That is why we cannot fail , because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed , the ones who suffer silently and the ones who share their stories with us at town halls , in e mails , and in letters.
I received one of those letters a few days ago.
It was from our beloved friend and colleague Ted Kennedy.
He had written it back in May , shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal.
He asked that it be delivered upon his death.
In it he spoke about what a happy time his last months were , thanks to the love and support of family and friends , his wife Vicki , his amazing children , who are all here tonight.
And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform , that great unfinished business of our society , he called it , would finally pass.
He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity , but he also reminded me that it concerns more than material things.
What we face , he wrote , is above all a moral issue at stake are not just the details of policy , but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.
I have thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days the character of our country.
One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self reliance , our rugged individualism , our fierce defense of freedom , and our healthy skepticism of government.
And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and , yes , sometimes angry , debate.
That is our history.
For some of Ted Kennedy s critics , his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty.
In their minds , his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government.
But those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here , people of both parties , know that what drove him was something more.
His friend Orrin Hatch , he knows that.
They worked together to provide children with health insurance.
His friend John McCain knows that.
They worked together on a patient s bill of rights.
His friend Chuck Grassley knows that.
They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities.
On issues like these , Ted Kennedy s passion was born not of some rigid ideology , but of his own experience.
It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer.
He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick.
And he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance , what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent , there is something that could make you better , but I just cannot afford it.
That large heartedness , that concern and regard for the plight of others , is not a partisan feeling it is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling.
It too is part of the American character , our ability to stand in other people s shoes , a recognition that we are all in this together , and when fortune turns against one of us , others are there to lend a helping hand , a belief that in this country , hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play , and an acknowledgment that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise.
This has always been the history of our progress.
In 1935 , when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away , there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism , but the men and women of Congress stood fast , and we are all the better for it.
In 1965 , when some argued that Medicare represented a Government takeover of health care , Members of Congress , Democrats and Republicans , did not back down.
They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind.
You see , our predecessors understood that government could not , and should not , solve every problem.
They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom.
But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little , that without the leavening hand of wise policy , markets can crash , monopolies can stifle competition , the vulnerable can be exploited.
And they knew that when any government measure , no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial , is subject to scorn when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un American , when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom , and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter , that at that point we do not merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges , we lose something essential about ourselves.
That was true then it remains true today.
I understand how difficult this health care debate has been.
I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them.
I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road , to defer reform one more year or one more election or one more term.
But that is not what the moment calls for.
That is not what we came here to do.
We did not come to fear the future.
We came here to shape it.
I still believe we can act even when it is hard.
I still believe.
I still believe that we can act when it is hard.
I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility and gridlock with progress.
I still believe we can do great things and that here and now we will meet history s test , because that is who we are.
That is our calling.
That is our character.
Thank you , God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America.
.
Thank you very much.
Everybody , please have a seat.
Thank you very much.
Well , thank you.
It is good to be back.
It is good to be back in New York , it is good to be back in the Great Hall at Cooper Union.
We have got some special guests here that I want to acknowledge.
Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is here in the house.
Governor David Paterson is here.
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.
State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is here.
The Mayor of New York City , Michael Bloomberg.
George Campbell , , president of Cooper Union.
And all the citywide elected officials who are here.
Thank you very much for your attendance.
It is wonderful to be back in Cooper Union , where generations of leaders and citizens have come to defend their ideas and contest their differences.
It is also good to be back in Lower Manhattan , a few blocks from Wall Street.
It really is good to be back , because Wall Street is the heart of our nation s financial sector.
Now , since I last spoke here two years ago , our country has been through a terrible trial.
More than 8 million people have lost their jobs.
Countless small businesses have had to shut their doors.
Trillions of dollars in savings have been lost forcing seniors to put off retirement , young people to postpone college , entrepreneurs to give up on the dream of starting a company.
And as a nation we were forced to take unprecedented steps to rescue the financial system and the broader economy.
And as a result of the decisions we made some of which , let us face it , were very unpopular we are seeing hopeful signs.
A little more than one year ago we were losing an average of 750 , 000 jobs each month.
Today , America is adding jobs again.
One year ago the economy was shrinking rapidly.
Today the economy is growing.
In fact , we have seen the fastest turnaround in growth in nearly three decades.
But you are here and I am here because we have got more work to do.
Until this progress is felt not just on Wall Street but on Main Street we cannot be satisfied.
Until the millions of our neighbors who are looking for work can find a job , and wages are growing at a meaningful pace , we may be able to claim a technical recovery but we will not have truly recovered.
And even as we seek to revive this economy , it is also incumbent on us to rebuild it stronger than before.
We do not want an economy that has the same weaknesses that led to this crisis.
And that means addressing some of the underlying problems that led to this turmoil and devastation in the first place.
Now , one of the most significant contributors to this recession was a financial crisis as dire as any we have known in generations at least since the 30s.
And that crisis was born of a failure of responsibility from Wall Street all the way to Washington that brought down many of the world s largest financial firms and nearly dragged our economy into a second Great Depression.
It was that failure of responsibility that I spoke about when I came to New York more than two years ago before the worst of the crisis had unfolded.
It was back in 2007.
And I take no satisfaction in noting that my comments then have largely been borne out by the events that followed.
But I repeat what I said then because it is essential that we learn the lessons from this crisis so we do not doom ourselves to repeat it.
And make no mistake , that is exactly what will happen if we allow this moment to pass and that is an outcome that is unacceptable to me and it is unacceptable to you , the American people.
As I said on this stage two years ago , I believe in the power of the free market.
I believe in a strong financial sector that helps people to raise capital and get loans and invest their savings.
That is part of what has made America what it is.
But a free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it.
That is what happened too often in the years leading up to this crisis.
Some and let me be clear , not all but some on Wall Street forgot that behind every dollar traded or leveraged there is family looking to buy a house , or pay for an education , open a business , save for retirement.
What happens on Wall Street has real consequences across the country , across our economy.
I have spoken before about the need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the 21st century.
And given the importance of the financial sector , Wall Street reform is an absolutely essential part of that foundation.
Without it , our house will continue to sit on shifting sands , and our families , businesses , and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crises.
That is why I feel so strongly that we need to enact a set of updated , commonsense rules to ensure accountability on Wall Street and to protect consumers in our financial system.
Now , here s the good news A comprehensive plan to achieve these reforms has already passed the House of Representatives.
A Senate version is currently being debated , drawing on ideas from Democrats and Republicans.
Both bills represent significant improvement on the flawed rules that we have in place today , despite the furious effort of industry lobbyists to shape this legislation to their special interests.
And for those of you in the financial sector I am sure that some of these lobbyists work for you and they are doing what they are being paid to do.
But I am here today specifically when I speak to the titans of industry here because I want to urge you to join us , instead of fighting us in this effort.
I am here because I believe that these reforms are , in the end , not only in the best interest of our country , but in the best interest of the financial sector.
And I am here to explain what reform will look like , and why it matters.
Now , first , the bill being considered in the Senate would create what we did not have before , and that is a way to protect the financial system and the broader economy and American taxpayers in the event that a large financial firm begins to fail.
If there is a Lehmans or an AIhow can we respond in a way that does not force taxpayers to pick up the tab or , alternatively , could bring down the whole system.
In an ordinary local bank when it approaches insolvency , we have got a process , an orderly process through the FDIthat ensures that depositors are protected , maintains confidence in the banking system , and it works.
Customers and taxpayers are protected and owners and management lose their equity.
But we do not have that kind of process designed to contain the failure of a Lehman Brothers or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country.
That is why , when this crisis began , crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world s biggest companies companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets had to take place in hurried discussions in the middle of the night.
And that is why , to save the entire economy from an even worse catastrophe , we had to deploy taxpayer dollars.
Now , much of that money has now been paid back and my administration has proposed a fee to be paid by large financial firms to recover all the money , every dime , because the American people should never have been put in that position in the first place.
But this is why we need a system to shut these firms down with the least amount of collateral damage to innocent people and innocent businesses.
And from the start , I have insisted that the financial industry , not taxpayers , shoulder the costs in the event that a large financial company should falter.
The goal is to make certain that taxpayers are never again on the hook because a firm is deemed too big to fail.
Now , there is a legitimate debate taking place about how best to ensure taxpayers are held harmless in this process.
And that is a legitimate debate , and I encourage that debate.
But what is not legitimate is to suggest that somehow the legislation being proposed is going to encourage future taxpayer bailouts , as some have claimed.
That makes for a good sound bite , but it is not factually accurate.
It is not true.
In fact , the system as it stands the system as it stands is what led to a series of massive , costly taxpayer bailouts.
And it is only with reform that we can avoid a similar outcome in the future.
In other words , a vote for reform is a vote to put a stop to taxpayer funded bailouts.
That is the truth.
End of story.
And nobody should be fooled in this debate.
By the way , these changes have the added benefit of creating incentives within the industry to ensure that no one company can ever threaten to bring down the whole economy.
To that end , the bill would also enact what is known as the Volcker Rule and there is a tall guy sitting in the front row here , Paul Volcker who we named it after.
And it does something very simple It places some limits on the size of banks and the kinds of risks that banking institutions can take.
This will not only safeguard our system against crises , this will also make our system stronger and more competitive by instilling confidence here at home and across the globe.
Markets depend on that confidence.
Part of what led to the turmoil of the past two years was that in the absence of clear rules and sound practices , people did not trust that our system was one in which it was safe to invest or lend.
As we have seen , that harms all of us.
So by enacting these reforms , we will help ensure that our financial system and our economy continues to be the envy of the world.
That is the first thing , making sure that we can wind down one firm if it gets into trouble without bringing the whole system down or forcing taxpayers to fund a bailout.
Number two , reform would bring new transparency to many financial markets.
As you know , part of what led to this crisis was firms like AIG and others who were making huge and risky bets , using derivatives and other complicated financial instruments , in ways that defied accountability , or even common sense.
In fact , many practices were so opaque , so confusing , so complex that the people inside the firms did not understand them , much less those who were charged with overseeing them.
They were not fully aware of the massive bets that were being placed.
That is what led Warren Buffett to describe derivatives that were bought and sold with little oversight as financial weapons of mass destruction.
That is what he called them.
And that is why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these kinds of transactions take place in the light of day.
Now , there is been a great deal of concern about these changes.
So I want to reiterate There is a legitimate role for these financial instruments in our economy.
They can help allay risk and spur investment.
And there are a lot of companies that use these instruments to that legitimate end they are managing exposure to fluctuating prices or currencies , fluctuating markets.
For example , a business might hedge against rising oil prices by buying a financial product to secure stable fuel costs , so an airlines might have an interest in locking in a decent price.
That is how markets are supposed to work.
The problem is these markets operated in the shadows of our economy , invisible to regulators , invisible to the public.
So reckless practices were rampant.
Risks accrued until they threatened our entire financial system.
And that is why these reforms are designed to respect legitimate activities but prevent reckless risk taking.
That is why we want to ensure that financial products like standardized derivatives are traded out in the open , in the full view of businesses , investors , and those charged with oversight.
And I was encouraged to see a Republican senator join with Democrats this week in moving forward on this issue.
That is a good sign.
That is a good sign.
For without action , we will continue to see what amounts to highly leveraged , loosely monitored gambling in our financial system , putting taxpayers and the economy in jeopardy.
And the only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that we are proposing are those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny.
Third , this plan would enact the strongest consumer financial protections ever.
And that is absolutely necessary because this financial crisis was not just the result of decisions made in the executive suites on Wall Street it was also the result of decisions made around kitchen tables across America , by folks who took on mortgages and credit cards and auto loans.
And while it is true that many Americans took on financial obligations that they knew or should have known they could not have afforded , millions of others were , frankly , duped.
They were misled by deceptive terms and conditions , buried deep in the fine print.
And while a few companies made out like bandits by exploiting their customers , our entire economy was made more vulnerable.
Millions of people have now lost their homes.
Tens of millions more have lost value in their homes.
Just about every sector of our economy has felt the pain , whether you are paving driveways in Arizona , or selling houses in Ohio , or you are doing home repairs in California , or you are using your home equity to start a small business in Florida.
That is why we need to give consumers more protection and more power in our financial system.
This is not about stifling competition , stifling innovation it is just the opposite.
With a dedicated agency setting ground rules and looking out for ordinary people in our financial system , we will empower consumers with clear and concise information when they are making financial decisions.
So instead of competing to offer confusing products , companies will compete the old fashioned way , by offering better products.
And that will mean more choices for consumers , more opportunities for businesses , and more stability in our financial system.
And unless your business model depends on bilking people , there is little to fear from these new rules.
Number four , the last key component of reform.
These Wall Street reforms will give shareholders new power in the financial system.
They will get what we call a say on pay , a voice with respect to the salaries and bonuses awarded to top executives.
And the SEC will have the authority to give shareholders more say in corporate elections , so that investors and pension holders have a stronger role in determining who manages the company in which they have placed their savings.
Now , Americans do not begrudge anybody for success when that success is earned.
But when we read in the past , and sometimes in the present , about enormous executive bonuses at firms even as they are relying on assistance from taxpayers or they are taking huge risks that threaten the system as a whole or their company is doing badly it offends our fundamental values.
Not only that , some of the salaries and bonuses that we have seen creates perverse incentives to take reckless risks that contributed to the crisis.
It is what helped lead to a relentless focus on a company s next quarter , to the detriment of its next year or its next decade.
And it led to a situation in which folks with the most to lose stock and pension holders had the least to say in the process.
And that has to change.
Let me close by saying this.
I have laid out a set of Wall Street reforms.
These are reforms that would put an end to taxpayer bailouts that would bring complex financial dealings out of the shadows that would protect consumers and that would give shareholders more power in the financial system.
But let us face it , we also need reform in Washington.
And the debate the debate over these changes is a perfect example.
I mean , we have seen battalions of financial industry lobbyists descending on Capitol Hill , firms spending millions to influence the outcome of this debate.
We have seen misleading arguments and attacks that are designed not to improve the bill but to weaken or to kill it.
We have seen a bipartisan process buckle under the weight of these withering forces , even as we have produced a proposal that by all accounts is a commonsense , reasonable , non ideological approach to target the root problems that led to the turmoil in our financial sector and ultimately in our entire economy.
So we have seen business as usual in Washington , but I believe we can and must put this kind of cynical politics aside.
We have got to put an end to it.
That is why I am here today.
That is why I am here today.
And to those of you who are in the financial sector , let me say this , we will not always see eye to eye.
We will not always agree.
But that does not mean that we have got to choose between two extremes.
We do not have to choose between markets that are unfettered by even modest protections against crisis , or markets that are stymied by onerous rules that suppress enterprise and innovation.
That is a false choice.
And we need no more proof than the crisis that we have just been through.
You see , there has always been a tension between the desire to allow markets to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rules to prevent markets from falling out of kilter.
But managing that tension , one that we have debated since the founding of this nation , is what has allowed our country to keep up with a changing world.
For in taking up this debate , in figuring out how to apply well worn principles with each new age , we ensure that we do not tip too far one way or the other that our democracy remains as dynamic and our economy remains as dynamic as it has in the past.
So , yes , this debate can be contentious.
It can be heated.
But in the end it serves only to make our country stronger.
It has allowed us to adapt and to thrive.
And I read a report recently that I think fairly illustrates this point.
It is from Time Magazine.
I am going to quote Through the great banking houses of Manhattan last week ran wild eyed alarm.
Big bankers stared at one another in anger and astonishment.
A bill just passed hellip would rivet upon their institutions what they considered a monstrous system hellip such a system , they felt , would not only rob them of their pride of profession but would reduce all banking to its lowest level.
That appeared in Time Magazine in June of 1933.
The system that caused so much consternation , so much concern was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , also known as the FDIan institution that has successfully secured the deposits of generations of Americans.
In the end , our system only works our markets are only free when there are basic safeguards that prevent abuse , that check excesses , that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system.
And that is what the reforms we have been proposing are designed to achieve no more , no less.
And because that is how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers , that it works for investors , and that it works for financial institutions in other words , that it works for all of us that is why we are working so hard to get this stuff passed.
This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history.
It is what I said when I spoke here two years ago.
Because ultimately , there is no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street.
We will rise or we will fall together as one nation.
And that is why I urge all of you to join me.
I urge all of you to join me , to join those who are seeking to pass these commonsense reforms.
And for those of you in the financial industry , I urge you to join me not only because it is in the interest of your industry , but also because it is in the interest of your country.
Thank you so much.
God bless you , and God bless the United States of America.
Thank you.
.
Hello , everybody.
I am glad to see that all of you braved the weather to be here.
A little while ago I had a meeting with the Democratic and Republican congressional leaders , and it went very well.
In fact , I understand that McConnell and Reid are out doing snow angels on the South Lawn together.
Can you picture that , Chuck Not really The meeting did go well , and I appreciate them making the trek.
We had a good and frank conversation and it is one that I hope we can continue on a more regular basis.
We all understand that there are legitimate and genuine differences between the parties , but despite the political posturing that often paralyzes this town , there are many issues upon which we can and should agree.
That is what the American people are demanding of us.
I think they are tired of every day being Election Day in Washington.
And at this critical time in our country , the people sent us here expect a seriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics.
That is why I am going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as we work to tackle the pressing challenges ahead.
I am confident , for example , that when one in 10 of our fellow citizens cannot work , we should be able to come together and help business create more jobs.
We ought to be able to agree on providing small businesses with additional tax credits and much needed lines of credit.
We ought to agree on investments in crumbling roads and bridges , and we should agree on tax breaks for making homes more energy efficient all of which will put more Americans to work.
Many of the job proposals that I have laid out have passed the House and are soon going to be debated in the Senate.
We spent a lot of time in this meeting discussing a jobs package and how we could move forward on that.
And if there are additional ideas , I will consider them as well.
What I will not consider is doing nothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country.
We also talked about restoring fiscal responsibility.
There are few matters on which there is as much vigorous bipartisan agreement , at least in public , but unfortunately there is also a lot of partisan wrangling behind closed doors.
This is what we know for sure For us to solve this extraordinary problem that is so many years in the making , it is going to take the cooperation of both parties.
It is not going to happen in any other way.
I am pleased that Congress supported my request to restore the pay as you go rule , which was instrumental in turning deficits into surpluses during the 1990s.
I have also called for a bipartisan fiscal commission.
Unfortunately this measure , which originally had received the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate and was cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Gregg , Democrats and Republicans , was blocked there.
So I am going to be creating this commission by executive order.
And during our meeting I asked the leadership of both parties to join in this serious effort to address our long term deficits , because when the politics is put aside , the reality of our fiscal challenge is not subject to interpretation.
Math is not partisan.
There ought to be a debate about how to close our deficits.
What we cannot accept is business as usual , and we cannot afford grandstanding at the expense of actually getting something done.
During our meeting we also touched briefly on how we can move forward on health reform.
I have already announced that in two weeks I will be holding a meeting with people from both parties , and as I told the congressional leadership , I am looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measured against this test.
Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the federal government , which spends a huge amount on health care Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by the insurance industry Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of working Americans who do not have it right now And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability We also talked about why this is so urgent.
Just this week , there was a report that Anthem Blue Cross , which is the largest insurer in the largest state , California , is planning on raising premiums for many individual policyholders by as much as 39 percent.
If we do not act , this is just a preview of coming attractions.
Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance millions more will lose their coverage altogether our deficits will continue to grow larger.
And we have an obligation both parties to tackle this issue in a serious way.
Now , bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside matters of party for the good of the country.
I will not hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friends in the minority party , but I also will not hesitate to condemn what I consider to be obstinacy that is rooted not in substantive disagreements but in political expedience.
We talked about this as well , particularly when it comes to the confirmation process.
I respect the Senate s role to advise and consent , but for months , qualified , non controversial nominees for critical positions in government , often positions related to our national security , have been held up despite having overwhelming support.
My nominee for one important job , the head of General Services Administration , which helps run the government , was denied a vote for nine months.
When she finally got a vote on her nomination , she was confirmed 96 to nothing.
That is not advise and consent that is delay and obstruct.
One senator , as you all are aware , had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmarks in his state.
In our meeting , I asked the congressional leadership to put a stop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months.
Surely we can set aside partisanship and do what is traditionally been done to confirm these nominations.
If the Senate does not act and I made this very clear if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees , I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess , because we cannot afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well functioning government.
My hope is that this will be the first of a series of meetings that I have with leadership of both parties in Congress.
We have got to get past the tired debates that have plagued our politics and left behind nothing but soaring debt and mounting challenges , greater hardships among the American people , and extraordinary frustrations among the American people.
Those frustrations are what led me to run for President , and as long as I am here in Washington , I intend to try to make this government work on their behalf.
So , you know , I am going to take a couple of questions , guys.
Major.
Well , here s how I responded to John in the meeting , and I have said this publicly before.
There are some core goals that have to be met.
We have got to control costs , both for families and businesses , but also for our government.
Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledge that the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending.
We cannot deal with our deficits and debt long term unless we get a handle on that.
So that has to be part of a package.
Number two , we have got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who have got health insurance.
And number three , we have got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individual market , as I just mentioned , in California , who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent.
That applies to the majority of small businesses , as well as sole proprietors.
They are struggling.
So I have got these goals.
Now , we have a package , as we work through the differences between the House and the Senate , and we will put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time , that meets those criteria , meets those goals.
But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans , they indicated , we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost.
And I said , great , let me see it.
And I have no interest in doing something that is more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way to do it.
So I am going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote these goals.
What I will not do , what I do not think makes sense and I do not think the American people want to see , would be another year of partisan wrangling around these issues another six months or eight months or nine months worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there is a lot of posturing.
Let us get the relevant parties together let us put the best ideas on the table.
My hope is that we can find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward , even if I do not get every single thing that I want.
But here s the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell Bipartisanship cannot be that I agree to all the things that they believe in or want , and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want , and that is the price of bipartisanship , right But that is sometimes the way it gets presented.
Mitch McConnell said something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coal technology and more drilling to increase oil production.
Well , of course he likes that that is part of the Republican agenda for energy , which I accept.
And I am willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway.
But there is got to be some give from their side as well.
That is true on health care that is true on energy that is true on financial reform.
That is what I am hoping gets accomplished at the summit.
What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over the last year.
I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills.
I think it is important for all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we are moving forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care , that there is complete transparency and all of these issues have been adequately vetted and adequately debated.
And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here s what we think we should do , but it also gives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here s our plan here s why we think this will work.
And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they did not think that the status quo was acceptable , and that is , right there , promising.
That indicates that if all sides agree that we cannot just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done.
Well , I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression and people were not sure whether the financial system was going to melt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession.
So let us be clear about the sources of uncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years A huge contraction , trillions of dollars of losses in people s 401s people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that they still have not worked out the housing market losing a whole bunch of value.
So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6 percent.
The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments , and I anticipate that they are going to start hiring at a more rapid clip.
What I have also heard is them saying that we would like to feel like Washington is working and able to get some things done.
There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty.
One way would be to say , well , you know what , we will just go back to what we were doing before on , let us say , the financial markets.
We will not have the regulations that we need we will not make any changes in terms of too big to fail.
That will provide certainty until the next financial crisis.
That is not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need.
The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets so that we do not have banks that are too big to fail that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts.
That requires legislation.
The sooner we can get that done , the better.
The same would be true when it comes to health care.
A lot of CEOs I hear from will say , boy , we had like you to get health care settled one way or another , but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent , that is the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment.
So I guess my answer would be this The sooner the business community has a sense that we have got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big , serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling , I think the better off the entire country is going to be.
I absolutely agree on that.
What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform , for example , to say , boy , we had be doing fine if we just did not try to regulate the banks.
That I think would be a mistake.
The small businesses I talk to and I have been talking to a lot of them as I have been traveling around the country over the last several months their biggest problem is right now they cannot get credit out of their banks so they are uncertain about that.
And they are still uncertain about orders do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more.
It is looking better at this point.
But that is not the rationale for people saying , I am not hiring.
Let me put it this way.
Most small businesses right now , if they have got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll , boost their inventory , and sell to those customers , they will do so.
Okay Let us see , let us get a print guy here.
David.
You know , I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach.
What do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy.
So we have to move in that direction.
What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth , produce jobs , make sure our businesses are competitive around the world , that we are going to need some of the old , traditional energy sources as we are developing these new ones and ramping them up.
So we cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy.
That just cannot happen.
We are going to have needs in these traditional sources.
And so the question then is , are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe , secure nuclear power that includes new technologies so that we can use coal which we have in abundance and is very cheap , but often is adding to our greenhouse gases can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy.
And my hope is that my Republican friends , but also Democrats , say to themselves , let us be practical and let us do both.
Let us not just do one or the other let us do both.
Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix.
But we have got to do both.
I am just a eternal optimist and so it is the right thing to do.
And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what is right for the country and assume that over time people , regardless of party , regardless of their particular political positions , are going to gravitate towards the truth.
Okay I am going to take two more.
Let us see Well , I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here , so go ahead , Chuck.
Why is everybody moaning about Todd Well , it is moving along fairly quickly.
I think that we have bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can align themselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community.
The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide the conversion of some of the low enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need for their medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens.
They rejected it although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it is not always clear who is speaking on behalf of the government , and we get a lot of different , mixed signals.
But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept.
That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.
And that is not acceptable to the international community , not just to the United States.
So what we have said from the start was we are moving on dual tracks.
If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead you down a path of being a member of good standing , then we welcome you.
If not Well , I am getting to that.
And if not , then the next step is sanctions.
They have made their choice so far , although the door is still open.
And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks is developing a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from the international community as a whole.
Well , meaning that there is going to be a We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran that their approach is unacceptable.
And the will be one aspect of that broader effort.
Well , the we are confident right now that the international community is unified around Iran s misbehavior in this area.
How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctions is something that we are going to have to see.
One thing I am pleased about is to see how forward leaning the Russians have been on this issue.
I think they clearly have seen that Iran has not been serious about solving what is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community.
All right I am going to make this the last question.
And I will take somebody from the back yes.
Yes.
On health care , the Republicans are asking whether the February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting your side , or will it just be the members of Congress And on Anthem Blue Cross , do you have the authority to go in and tell a private company they cannot charge that how will you stop them Well , I do not have the authority as I understand it I cannot simply issue an executive order lowering everybody s rates.
If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of grief on Capitol Hill.
That is why reform is so important.
That is why the status quo is unacceptable.
But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue.
I know the American people get frustrated in debating something like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by different groups and different interests.
It is a big , complicated , tough issue.
But what is also true is that without some action on the part of Congress , it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the current trajectory.
And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 percent.
The current trajectory is more and more people are losing health care.
I do not know if people noted , because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President is trying to take over a government takeover of health care.
I do not know if anybody noticed that for the first time this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the private sector not because of anything we did , but because more and more people are losing their health care from their employers.
It is becoming unaffordable.
That is what we are trying to prevent.
We want people to be able to get health care from their employers.
But we also understand that you have got to fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to give their employees insurance at an affordable rate.
And that is not happening right now.
To your question about the 25th , my hope is that this does not end up being political theater , as I think some of you have phrased it.
I want a substantive discussion.
We have not refined exactly how the agenda is going to go that day.
We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what they think would be most useful.
I do want to make sure that there is some people like the Congressional Budget Office , for example , that are considered non partisan , who can answer questions.
In this whole health care debate I am reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan , who was I guess in an argument with one of his colleagues , and his colleague was losing the argument so he got a little flustered and said to Senator Moynihan , Well , I am entitled to my own opinion.
And Senator Moynihan said , Well , you are entitled to your own opinion , but you are not entitled to your own facts.
I think that is the key to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care.
Let us establish some common facts.
Let us establish what the issues are , what the problems are , and let us test out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas do not.
And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work , then I think we can make some progress.
And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable.
So if it is established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those costs , I have said from the beginning of this debate I had be willing to work on that.
On the other hand , if I am told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs , then I am also going to insist , okay , let us look at that as one aspect of it , but what else are we willing to do And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier.
Bipartisanship cannot mean simply that Democrats give up everything that they believe in , find the handful of things that Republicans have been advocating for and we do those things , and then we have bipartisanship.
That is not how it works in any other realm of life.
That is certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle , although I usually do give in most of the time.
But the there is got to be some give and take , and that is what I am hoping can be accomplished.
And I am confident that is what the American people are looking for.
So , all right Okay , since there was not a jobs question I will make this the last one , jobs question.
Well , my understanding is first of all , the House has moved forward a jobs package that has some good elements in it.
My understanding is , is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as we speak on the Senate side about some elements of a package.
I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on.
Just to give you an example , the idea of eliminating capital gains for small businesses something we can all agree on.
I talked about it at the State of the Union address.
My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community banks who are lending to small businesses more capital , because that is something that I keep on hearing is one of the biggest problems that small businesses have out there.
So I think that it is realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I think need to be done , and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package and so forth.
It may take a series of incremental steps , but the one thing I am absolutely clear about is , is that we have got an economy that is growing right now , a huge boost in productivity that is the good news.
The bad news is , is that companies still have not taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full time.
We are seeing an increase in temporary workers , but they have not yet taken on that full time worker.
And so providing some additional impetus to them , right as the economy is moving in a positive direction , I think can end up yielding some good results.
All right Thank you , guys.
That was pretty good , thanks.
.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Please , please be seated.
To the families of those we have lost to all who called them friends to the students of this university , the public servants who are gathered here , the people of Tucson and the people of Arizona I have come here tonight as an American who , like all Americans , kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow.
There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts.
But know this The hopes of a nation are here tonight.
We mourn with you for the fallen.
We join you in your grief.
And we add our faith to yours that Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other living victims of this tragedy will pull through.
Scripture tells us There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God , the holy place where the Most High dwells.
God is within her , she will not fall God will help her at break of day.
On Saturday morning , Gabby , her staff and many of her constituents gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech.
They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents , so as to carry their concerns back to our nation s capital.
Gabby called it Congress on Your Corner just an updated version of government of and by and for the people.
And that quintessentially American scene , that was the scene that was shattered by a gunman s bullets.
And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday they , too , represented what is best in us , what is best in America.
Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years.
A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago appointed by President George Bush and rose to become Arizona s chief federal judge.
His colleagues described him as the hardest working judge within the Ninth Circuit.
He was on his way back from attending Mass , as he did every day , when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative.
John is survived by his loving wife , Maureen , his three sons and his five beautiful grandchildren.
George and Dorothy Morris Dot to her friends were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters.
They did everything together traveling the open road in their Renjoying what their friends called a 50 year honeymoon.
Saturday morning , they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say.
When gunfire rang out , George , a former Marine , instinctively tried to shield his wife.
Both were shot.
Dot passed away.
A New Jersey native , Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow.
But in the summer , she would return East , where her world revolved around her three children , her seven grandchildren and 2 year old great granddaughter.
A gifted quilter , she had often work under a favorite tree , or sometimes she had sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants to give out at the church where she volunteered.
A Republican , she took a liking to Gabby , and wanted to get to know her better.
Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together about 70 years ago.
They moved apart and started their own respective families.
But after both were widowed they found their way back here , to , as one of Mavy s daughters put it , be boyfriend and girlfriend again.
When they were not out on the road in their motor home , you could find them just up the road , helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ.
A retired construction worker , Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with his dog , Tux.
His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife , sacrificing his life for hers.
Everything everything Gabe Zimmerman did , he did with passion.
But his true passion was helping people.
As Gabby s outreach director , he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own , seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned , that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved , that government was working for ordinary folks.
He died doing what he loved talking with people and seeing how he could help.
And Gabe is survived by his parents , Ross and Emily , his brother , Ben , and his fianc eacute e , Kelly , who he planned to marry next year.
And then there is nine year old Christina Taylor Green.
Christina was an A student she was a dancer she was a gymnast she was a swimmer.
She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues , and as the only girl on her Little League team , no one put it past her.
She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age.
She had remind her mother , We are so blessed.
We have the best life.
And she had pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate.
Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing.
Our hearts are broken and yet , our hearts also have reason for fullness.
Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting , including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday.
I have just come from the University Medical Center , just a mile from here , where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak.
And I want to tell you her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you right after we went to visit , a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room , Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.
Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.
Gabby opened her eyes.
Gabby opened her eyes , so I can tell you she knows we are here.
She knows we love her.
And she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey.
We are there for her.
Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news , and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others.
We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez a volunteer in Gabby s office.
And , Daniel , I am sorry , you may deny it , but we have decided you are a hero because you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss , and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive.
We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload.
Right over there.
We are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch , who wrestled away the killer s ammunition , and undoubtedly saved some lives.
And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal those who d been hurt.
We are grateful to them.
These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle.
They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength.
Heroism is here , in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens , all around us , just waiting to be summoned as it was on Saturday morning.
Their actions , their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us.
It raises a question of what , beyond prayers and expressions of concern , is required of us going forward.
How can we honor the fallen How can we be true to their memory You see , when a tragedy like this strikes , it is part of our nature to demand explanations to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless.
Already we have seen a national conversation commence , not only about the motivations behind these killings , but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system.
And much of this process , of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future , is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self government.
But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do it is important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals , not in a way that wounds.
Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world , and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding.
In the words of Job , When I looked for light , then came darkness.
Bad things happen , and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath.
For the truth is none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack.
None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired , or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man s mind.
Yes , we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy.
We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence.
We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future.
But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other.
That we cannot do.
That we cannot do.
As we discuss these issues , let each of us do so with a good dose of humility.
Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame , let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations , to listen to each other more carefully , to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together.
After all , that is what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family especially if the loss is unexpected.
We are shaken out of our routines.
We are forced to look inward.
We reflect on the past Did we spend enough time with an aging parent , we wonder.
Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them , not just once in a while but every single day So sudden loss causes us to look backward but it also forces us to look forward to reflect on the present and the future , on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us.
We may ask ourselves if we have shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives.
Perhaps we question whether we are doing right by our children , or our community , whether our priorities are in order.
We recognize our own mortality , and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth , what matters is not wealth , or status , or power , or fame but rather , how well we have loved and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better.
And that process that process of reflection , of making sure we align our values with our actions that , I believe , is what a tragedy like this requires.
For those who were harmed , those who were killed they are part of our family , an American family 300 million strong.
We may not have known them personally , but surely we see ourselves in them.
In George and Dot , in Dorwan and Mavy , we sense the abiding love we have for our own husbands , our own wives , our own life partners.
Phyllis she is our mom or our grandma Gabe our brother or son.
In Judge Roll , we recognize not only a man who prized his family and doing his job well , but also a man who embodied America s fidelity to the law.
And in Gabby in Gabby , we see a reflection of our public spiritedness that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating , sometimes contentious , but always necessary and never ending process to form a more perfect union.
And in Christina in Christina we see all of our children.
So curious , so trusting , so energetic , so full of magic.
So deserving of our love.
And so deserving of our good example.
If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate as it should let us make sure it is worthy of those we have lost.
Let us make sure it is not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle.
The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better.
To be better in our private lives , to be better friends and neighbors and coworkers and parents.
And if , as has been discussed in recent days , their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse , let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy it did not but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way that would make them proud.
We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords , who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans , and that we can question each other s ideas without questioning each other s love of country and that our task , working together , is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations.
They believed they believed , and I believe that we can be better.
Those who died here , those who saved life here they help me believe.
We may not be able to stop all evil in the world , but I know that how we treat one another , that is entirely up to us.
And I believe that for all our imperfections , we are full of decency and goodness , and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.
That is what I believe , in part because that is what a child like Christina Taylor Green believed.
Imagine imagine for a moment , here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship just starting to glimpse the fact that some day she , too , might play a part in shaping her nation s future.
She had been elected to her student council.
She saw public service as something exciting and hopeful.
She was off to meet her congresswoman , someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model.
She saw all this through the eyes of a child , undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted.
I want to live up to her expectations.
I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it.
I want America to be as good as she imagined it.
All of us we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children s expectations.
As has already been mentioned , Christina was given to us on September 11th , 2001 , one of 50 babies born that day to be pictured in a book called Faces of Hope.
On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a child s life.
I hope you help those in need , read one.
I hope you know all the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart.
I hope you jump in rain puddles.
If there are rain puddles in Heaven , Christina is jumping in them today.
And here on this Earth here on this Earth , we place our hands over our hearts , and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle , happy spirit.
May God bless and keep those we have lost in restful and eternal peace.
May He love and watch over the survivors.
And may He bless the United States of America.
.
Good evening.
Tonight , I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden , the leader of al Qaeda , and a terrorist who is responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women , and children.
It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history.
The images of 9 11 are seared into our national memory hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.
And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world.
The empty seat at the dinner table.
Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father.
Parents who would never know the feeling of their child s embrace.
Nearly 3 , 000 citizens taken from us , leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.
On September 11 , 2001 , in our time of grief , the American people came together.
We offered our neighbors a hand , and we offered the wounded our blood.
We reaffirmed our ties to each other , and our love of community and country.
On that day , no matter where we came from , what God we prayed to , or what race or ethnicity we were , we were united as one American family.
We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice.
We quickly learned that the 9 11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda an organization headed by Osama bin Laden , which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe.
And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens , our friends , and our allies.
Over the last 10 years , thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals , we have made great strides in that effort.
We have disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense.
In Afghanistan , we removed the Taliban government , which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support.
And around the globe , we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists , including several who were a part of the 9 11 plot.
Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan.
Meanwhile , al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world.
And so shortly after taking office , I directed Leon Panetta , the director of the CIto make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda , even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat his network.
Then , last August , after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community , I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden.
It was far from certain , and it took many months to run this thread to ground.
I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan.
And finally , last week , I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action , and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.
Today , at my direction , the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan.
A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.
No Americans were harmed.
They took care to avoid civilian casualties.
After a firefight , they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.
For over two decades , bin Laden has been al Qaeda s leader and symbol , and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies.
The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation s effort to defeat al Qaeda.
Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort.
There is no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us.
We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.
As we do , we must also reaffirm that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam.
I have made clear , just as President Bush did shortly after 9 11 , that our war is not against Islam.
Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader he was a mass murderer of Muslims.
Indeed , al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries , including our own.
So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.
Over the years , I have repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was.
That is what we have done.
But it is important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.
Indeed , bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well , and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.
Tonight , I called President Zardari , and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts.
They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations.
And going forward , it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.
The American people did not choose this fight.
It came to our shores , and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens.
After nearly 10 years of service , struggle , and sacrifice , we know well the costs of war.
These efforts weigh on me every time as Commander in Chief , have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one , or look into the eyes of a service member who is been gravely wounded.
So Americans understand the costs of war.
Yet as a country , we will never tolerate our security being threatened , nor stand idly by when our people have been killed.
We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies.
We will be true to the values that make us who we are.
And on nights like this one , we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda s terror Justice has been done.
Tonight , we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome.
The American people do not see their work , nor know their names.
But tonight , they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.
We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation , for they exemplify the professionalism , patriotism , and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.
And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.
Finally , let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9 11 that we have never forgotten your loss , nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores.
And tonight , let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9 11.
I know that it has , at times , frayed.
Yet today s achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people.
The cause of securing our country is not complete.
But tonight , we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to.
That is the story of our history , whether it is the pursuit of prosperity for our people , or the struggle for equality for all our citizens our commitment to stand up for our values abroad , and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place.
Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power , but because of who we are one nation , under God , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you.
May God bless you.
And may God bless the United States of America.
.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Please , have a seat.
Thank you very much.
I want to begin by thanking Hillary Clinton , who has traveled so much these last six months that she is approaching a new landmark one million frequent flyer miles.
I count on Hillary every single day , and I believe that she will go down as one of the finest Secretaries of State in our nation s history.
The State Department is a fitting venue to mark a new chapter in American diplomacy.
For six months , we have witnessed an extraordinary change taking place in the Middle East and North Africa.
Square by square , town by town , country by country , the people have risen up to demand their basic human rights.
Two leaders have stepped aside.
More may follow.
And though these countries may be a great distance from our shores , we know that our own future is bound to this region by the forces of economics and security , by history and by faith.
Today , I want to talk about this change the forces that are driving it and how we can respond in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security.
Now , already , we have done much to shift our foreign policy following a decade defined by two costly conflicts.
After years of war in Iraq , we have removed 100 , 000 American troops and ended our combat mission there.
In Afghanistan , we have broken the Taliban s momentum , and this July we will begin to bring our troops home and continue a transition to Afghan lead.
And after years of war against al Qaeda and its affiliates , we have dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader , Osama bin Laden.
Bin Laden was no martyr.
He was a mass murderer who offered a message of hate an insistence that Muslims had to take up arms against the West , and that violence against men , women and children was the only path to change.
He rejected democracy and individual rights for Muslims in favor of violent extremism his agenda focused on what he could destroy not what he could build.
Bin Laden and his murderous vision won some adherents.
But even before his death , al Qaeda was losing its struggle for relevance , as the overwhelming majority of people saw that the slaughter of innocents did not answer their cries for a better life.
By the time we found bin Laden , al Qaeda s agenda had come to be seen by the vast majority of the region as a dead end , and the people of the Middle East and North Africa had taken their future into their own hands.
That story of self determination began six months ago in Tunisia.
On December 17th , a young vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi was devastated when a police officer confiscated his cart.
This was not unique.
It is the same kind of humiliation that takes place every day in many parts of the world the relentless tyranny of governments that deny their citizens dignity.
Only this time , something different happened.
After local officials refused to hear his complaints , this young man , who had never been particularly active in politics , went to the headquarters of the provincial government , doused himself in fuel , and lit himself on fire.
There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building up for years.
In America , think of the defiance of those patriots in Boston who refused to pay taxes to a King , or the dignity of Rosa Parks as she sat courageously in her seat.
So it was in Tunisia , as that vendor s act of desperation tapped into the frustration felt throughout the country.
Hundreds of protesters took to the streets , then thousands.
And in the face of batons and sometimes bullets , they refused to go home day after day , week after week until a dictator of more than two decades finally left power.
The story of this revolution , and the ones that followed , should not have come as a surprise.
The nations of the Middle East and North Africa won their independence long ago , but in too many places their people did not.
In too many countries , power has been concentrated in the hands of a few.
In too many countries , a citizen like that young vendor had nowhere to turn no honest judiciary to hear his case no independent media to give him voice no credible political party to represent his views no free and fair election where he could choose his leader.
And this lack of self determination the chance to make your life what you will has applied to the region s economy as well.
Yes , some nations are blessed with wealth in oil and gas , and that has led to pockets of prosperity.
But in a global economy based on knowledge , based on innovation , no development strategy can be based solely upon what comes out of the ground.
Nor can people reach their potential when you cannot start a business without paying a bribe.
In the face of these challenges , too many leaders in the region tried to direct their people s grievances elsewhere.
The West was blamed as the source of all ills , a half century after the end of colonialism.
Antagonism toward Israel became the only acceptable outlet for political expression.
Divisions of tribe , ethnicity and religious sect were manipulated as a means of holding on to power , or taking it away from somebody else.
But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore.
Satellite television and the Internet provide a window into the wider world a world of astonishing progress in places like India and Indonesia and Brazil.
Cell phones and social networks allow young people to connect and organize like never before.
And so a new generation has emerged.
And their voices tell us that change cannot be denied.
In Cairo , we heard the voice of the young mother who said , It is like I can finally breathe fresh air for the first time.
In Sanaa , we heard the students who chanted , The night must come to an end.
In Benghazi , we heard the engineer who said , Our words are free now.
It is a feeling you cannot explain.
In Damascus , we heard the young man who said , After the first yelling , the first shout , you feel dignity.
Those shouts of human dignity are being heard across the region.
And through the moral force of nonviolence , the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than terrorists have accomplished in decades.
Of course , change of this magnitude does not come easily.
In our day and age a time of 24 hour news cycles and constant communication people expect the transformation of the region to be resolved in a matter of weeks.
But it will be years before this story reaches its end.
Along the way , there will be good days and there will bad days.
In some places , change will be swift in others , gradual.
And as we have already seen , calls for change may give way , in some cases , to fierce contests for power.
The question before us is what role America will play as this story unfolds.
For decades , the United States has pursued a set of core interests in the region countering terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons securing the free flow of commerce and safe guarding the security of the region standing up for Israel s security and pursuing Arab Israeli peace.
We will continue to do these things , with the firm belief that America s interests are not hostile to people s hopes they are essential to them.
We believe that no one benefits from a nuclear arms race in the region , or al Qaeda s brutal attacks.
We believe people everywhere would see their economies crippled by a cut off in energy supplies.
As we did in the Gulf War , we will not tolerate aggression across borders , and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners.
Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind.
Moreover , failure to speak to the broader aspirations of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that has festered for years that the United States pursues our interests at their expense.
Given that this mistrust runs both ways as Americans have been seared by hostage taking and violent rhetoric and terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of our citizens a failure to change our approach threatens a deepening spiral of division between the United States and the Arab world.
And that is why , two years ago in Cairo , I began to broaden our engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect.
I believed then and I believe now that we have a stake not just in the stability of nations , but in the self determination of individuals.
The status quo is not sustainable.
Societies held together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time , but they are built upon fault lines that will eventually tear asunder.
So we face a historic opportunity.
We have the chance to show that America values the dignity of the street vendor in Tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator.
There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self determination and opportunity.
Yes , there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise.
But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region , we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be.
Of course , as we do , we must proceed with a sense of humility.
It is not America that put people into the streets of Tunis or Cairo it was the people themselves who launched these movements , and it is the people themselves that must ultimately determine their outcome.
Not every country will follow our particular form of representative democracy , and there will be times when our short term interests do not align perfectly with our long term vision for the region.
But we can , and we will , speak out for a set of core principles principles that have guided our response to the events over the past six months The United States opposes the use of violence and repression against the people of the region.
The United States supports a set of universal rights.
And these rights include free speech , the freedom of peaceful assembly , the freedom of religion , equality for men and women under the rule of law , and the right to choose your own leaders whether you live in Baghdad or Damascus , Sanaa or Tehran.
And we support political and economic reform in the Middle East and North Africa that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region.
Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest.
Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions , and supported by all of the diplomatic , economic and strategic tools at our disposal.
Let me be specific.
First , it will be the policy of the United States to promote reform across the region , and to support transitions to democracy.
That effort begins in Egypt and Tunisia , where the stakes are high as Tunisia was at the vanguard of this democratic wave , and Egypt is both a longstanding partner and the Arab world s largest nation.
Both nations can set a strong example through free and fair elections , a vibrant civil society , accountable and effective democratic institutions , and responsible regional leadership.
But our support must also extend to nations where transitions have yet to take place.
Unfortunately , in too many countries , calls for change have thus far been answered by violence.
The most extreme example is Libya , where Muammar Qaddafi launched a war against his own people , promising to hunt them down like rats.
As I said when the United States joined an international coalition to intervene , we cannot prevent every injustice perpetrated by a regime against its people , and we have learned from our experience in Iraq just how costly and difficult it is to try to impose regime change by force no matter how well intentioned it may be.
But in Libya , we saw the prospect of imminent massacre , we had a mandate for action , and heard the Libyan people s call for help.
Had we not acted along with our NATO allies and regional coalition partners , thousands would have been killed.
The message would have been clear Keep power by killing as many people as it takes.
Now , time is working against Qaddafi.
He does not have control over his country.
The opposition has organized a legitimate and credible Interim Council.
And when Qaddafi inevitably leaves or is forced from power , decades of provocation will come to an end , and the transition to a democratic Libya can proceed.
While Libya has faced violence on the greatest scale , it is not the only place where leaders have turned to repression to remain in power.
Most recently , the Syrian regime has chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens.
The United States has condemned these actions , and working with the international community we have stepped up our sanctions on the Syrian regime including sanctions announced yesterday on President Assad and those around him.
The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy.
President Assad now has a choice He can lead that transition , or get out of the way.
The Syrian government must stop shooting demonstrators and allow peaceful protests.
It must release political prisoners and stop unjust arrests.
It must allow human rights monitors to have access to cities like Dara a and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition.
Otherwise , President Assad and his regime will continue to be challenged from within and will continue to be isolated abroad.
So far , Syria has followed its Iranian ally , seeking assistance from Tehran in the tactics of suppression.
And this speaks to the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime , which says it stand for the rights of protesters abroad , yet represses its own people at home.
Let us remember that the first peaceful protests in the region were in the streets of Tehran , where the government brutalized women and men , and threw innocent people into jail.
We still hear the chants echo from the rooftops of Tehran.
The image of a young woman dying in the streets is still seared in our memory.
And we will continue to insist that the Iranian people deserve their universal rights , and a government that does not smother their aspirations.
Now , our opposition to Iran s intolerance and Iran s repressive measures , as well as its illicit nuclear program and its support of terror , is well known.
But if America is to be credible , we must acknowledge that at times our friends in the region have not all reacted to the demands for consistent change with change that is consistent with the principles that I have outlined today.
That is true in Yemen , where President Saleh needs to follow through on his commitment to transfer power.
And that is true today in Bahrain.
Bahrain is a longstanding partner , and we are committed to its security.
We recognize that Iran has tried to take advantage of the turmoil there , and that the Bahraini government has a legitimate interest in the rule of law.
Nevertheless , we have insisted both publicly and privately that mass arrests and brute force are at odds with the universal rights of Bahrain s citizens , and we will and such steps will not make legitimate calls for reform go away.
The only way forward is for the government and opposition to engage in a dialogue , and you cannot have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful opposition are in jail.
The government must create the conditions for dialogue , and the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all Bahrainis.
Indeed , one of the broader lessons to be drawn from this period is that sectarian divides need not lead to conflict.
In Iraq , we see the promise of a multiethnic , multisectarian democracy.
The Iraqi people have rejected the perils of political violence in favor of a democratic process , even as they have taken full responsibility for their own security.
Of course , like all new democracies , they will face setbacks.
But Iraq is poised to play a key role in the region if it continues its peaceful progress.
And as they do , we will be proud to stand with them as a steadfast partner.
So in the months ahead , America must use all our influence to encourage reform in the region.
Even as we acknowledge that each country is different , we need to speak honestly about the principles that we believe in , with friend and foe alike.
Our message is simple If you take the risks that reform entails , you will have the full support of the United States.
We must also build on our efforts to broaden our engagement beyond elites , so that we reach the people who will shape the future particularly young people.
We will continue to make good on the commitments that I made in Cairo to build networks of entrepreneurs and expand exchanges in education , to foster cooperation in science and technology , and combat disease.
Across the region , we intend to provide assistance to civil society , including those that may not be officially sanctioned , and who speak uncomfortable truths.
And we will use the technology to connect with and listen to the voices of the people.
For the fact is , real reform does not come at the ballot box alone.
Through our efforts we must support those basic rights to speak your mind and access information.
We will support open access to the Internet , and the right of journalists to be heard whether it is a big news organization or a lone blogger.
In the 21st century , information is power , the truth cannot be hidden , and the legitimacy of governments will ultimately depend on active and informed citizens.
Such open discourse is important even if what is said does not square with our worldview.
Let me be clear , America respects the right of all peaceful and law abiding voices to be heard , even if we disagree with them.
And sometimes we profoundly disagree with them.
We look forward to working with all who embrace genuine and inclusive democracy.
What we will oppose is an attempt by any group to restrict the rights of others , and to hold power through coercion and not consent.
Because democracy depends not only on elections , but also strong and accountable institutions , and the respect for the rights of minorities.
Such tolerance is particularly important when it comes to religion.
In Tahrir Square , we heard Egyptians from all walks of life chant , Muslims , Christians , we are one.
America will work to see that this spirit prevails that all faiths are respected , and that bridges are built among them.
In a region that was the birthplace of three world religions , intolerance can lead only to suffering and stagnation.
And for this season of change to succeed , Coptic Christians must have the right to worship freely in Cairo , just as Shia must never have their mosques destroyed in Bahrain.
What is true for religious minorities is also true when it comes to the rights of women.
History shows that countries are more prosperous and more peaceful when women are empowered.
And that is why we will continue to insist that universal rights apply to women as well as men by focusing assistance on child and maternal health by helping women to teach , or start a business by standing up for the right of women to have their voices heard , and to run for office.
The region will never reach its full potential when more than half of its population is prevented from achieving their full potential.
Now , even as we promote political reform , even as we promote human rights in the region , our efforts cannot stop there.
So the second way that we must support positive change in the region is through our efforts to advance economic development for nations that are transitioning to democracy.
After all , politics alone has not put protesters into the streets.
The tipping point for so many people is the more constant concern of putting food on the table and providing for a family.
Too many people in the region wake up with few expectations other than making it through the day , perhaps hoping that their luck will change.
Throughout the region , many young people have a solid education , but closed economies leave them unable to find a job.
Entrepreneurs are brimming with ideas , but corruption leaves them unable to profit from those ideas.
The greatest untapped resource in the Middle East and North Africa is the talent of its people.
In the recent protests , we see that talent on display , as people harness technology to move the world.
It is no coincidence that one of the leaders of Tahrir Square was an executive for Google.
That energy now needs to be channeled , in country after country , so that economic growth can solidify the accomplishments of the street.
For just as democratic revolutions can be triggered by a lack of individual opportunity , successful democratic transitions depend upon an expansion of growth and broad based prosperity.
So , drawing from what we have learned around the world , we think it is important to focus on trade , not just aid on investment , not just assistance.
The goal must be a model in which protectionism gives way to openness , the reigns of commerce pass from the few to the many , and the economy generates jobs for the young.
America s support for democracy will therefore be based on ensuring financial stability , promoting reform , and integrating competitive markets with each other and the global economy.
And we are going to start with Tunisia and Egypt.
First , we have asked the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to present a plan at next week s G8 summit for what needs to be done to stabilize and modernize the economies of Tunisia and Egypt.
Together , we must help them recover from the disruptions of their democratic upheaval , and support the governments that will be elected later this year.
And we are urging other countries to help Egypt and Tunisia meet its near term financial needs.
Second , we do not want a democratic Egypt to be saddled by the debts of its past.
So we will relieve a democratic Egypt of up to 1 billion in debt , and work with our Egyptian partners to invest these resources to foster growth and entrepreneurship.
We will help Egypt regain access to markets by guaranteeing 1 billion in borrowing that is needed to finance infrastructure and job creation.
And we will help newly democratic governments recover assets that were stolen.
Third , we are working with Congress to create Enterprise Funds to invest in Tunisia and Egypt.
And these will be modeled on funds that supported the transitions in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
OPIC will soon launch a 2 billion facility to support private investment across the region.
And we will work with the allies to refocus the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development so that it provides the same support for democratic transitions and economic modernization in the Middle East and North Africa as it has in Europe.
Fourth , the United States will launch a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership Initiative in the Middle East and North Africa.
If you take out oil exports , this entire region of over 400 million people exports roughly the same amount as Switzerland.
So we will work with the EU to facilitate more trade within the region , build on existing agreements to promote integration with and European markets , and open the door for those countries who adopt high standards of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement.
And just as EU membership served as an incentive for reform in Europe , so should the vision of a modern and prosperous economy create a powerful force for reform in the Middle East and North Africa.
Prosperity also requires tearing down walls that stand in the way of progress the corruption of elites who steal from their people the red tape that stops an idea from becoming a business the patronage that distributes wealth based on tribe or sect.
We will help governments meet international obligations , and invest efforts at anti corruption by working with parliamentarians who are developing reforms , and activists who use technology to increase transparency and hold government accountable.
Politics and human rights economic reform.
Let me conclude by talking about another cornerstone of our approach to the region , and that relates to the pursuit of peace.
For decades , the conflict between Israelis and Arabs has cast a shadow over the region.
For Israelis , it has meant living with the fear that their children could be blown up on a bus or by rockets fired at their homes , as well as the pain of knowing that other children in the region are taught to hate them.
For Palestinians , it has meant suffering the humiliation of occupation , and never living in a nation of their own.
Moreover , this conflict has come with a larger cost to the Middle East , as it impedes partnerships that could bring greater security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people.
For over two years , my administration has worked with the parties and the international community to end this conflict , building on decades of work by previous administrations.
Yet expectations have gone unmet.
Israeli settlement activity continues.
Palestinians have walked away from talks.
The world looks at a conflict that has grinded on and on and on , and sees nothing but stalemate.
Indeed , there are those who argue that with all the change and uncertainty in the region , it is simply not possible to move forward now.
I disagree.
At a time when the people of the Middle East and North Africa are casting off the burdens of the past , the drive for a lasting peace that ends the conflict and resolves all claims is more urgent than ever.
That is certainly true for the two parties involved.
For the Palestinians , efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure.
Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September will not create an independent state.
Palestinian leaders will not achieve peace or prosperity if Hamas insists on a path of terror and rejection.
And Palestinians will never realize their independence by denying the right of Israel to exist.
As for Israel , our friendship is rooted deeply in a shared history and shared values.
Our commitment to Israel s security is unshakeable.
And we will stand against attempts to single it out for criticism in international forums.
But precisely because of our friendship , it is important that we tell the truth The status quo is unsustainable , and Israel too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace.
The fact is , a growing number of Palestinians live west of the Jordan River.
Technology will make it harder for Israel to defend itself.
A region undergoing profound change will lead to populism in which millions of people not just one or two leaders must believe peace is possible.
The international community is tired of an endless process that never produces an outcome.
The dream of a Jewish and democratic state cannot be fulfilled with permanent occupation.
Now , ultimately , it is up to the Israelis and Palestinians to take action.
No peace can be imposed upon them not by the United States not by anybody else.
But endless delay will not make the problem go away.
What America and the international community can do is to state frankly what everyone knows a lasting peace will involve two states for two peoples Israel as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people , and the state of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people , each state enjoying self determination , mutual recognition , and peace.
So while the core issues of the conflict must be negotiated , the basis of those negotiations is clear a viable Palestine , a secure Israel.
The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states , with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel , Jordan , and Egypt , and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine.
We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps , so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.
The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves , and reach their full potential , in a sovereign and contiguous state.
As for security , every state has the right to self defense , and Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat.
Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism , to stop the infiltration of weapons , and to provide effective border security.
The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign , non militarized state.
And the duration of this transition period must be agreed , and the effectiveness of security arrangements must be demonstrated.
These principles provide a foundation for negotiations.
Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met.
I am aware that these steps alone will not resolve the conflict , because two wrenching and emotional issues will remain the future of Jerusalem , and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair , and that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.
Now , let me say this Recognizing that negotiations need to begin with the issues of territory and security does not mean that it will be easy to come back to the table.
In particular , the recent announcement of an agreement between Fatah and Hamas raises profound and legitimate questions for Israel How can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist And in the weeks and months to come , Palestinian leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question.
Meanwhile , the United States , our Quartet partners , and the Arab states will need to continue every effort to get beyond the current impasse.
I recognize how hard this will be.
Suspicion and hostility has been passed on for generations , and at times it has hardened.
But I am convinced that the majority of Israelis and Palestinians would rather look to the future than be trapped in the past.
We see that spirit in the Israeli father whose son was killed by Hamas , who helped start an organization that brought together Israelis and Palestinians who had lost loved ones.
That father said , I gradually realized that the only hope for progress was to recognize the face of the conflict.
We see it in the actions of a Palestinian who lost three daughters to Israeli shells in Gaza.
I have the right to feel angry , he said.
So many people were expecting me to hate.
My answer to them is I shall not hate.
Let us hope , he said , for tomorrow.
That is the choice that must be made not simply in the Israeli Palestinian conflict , but across the entire region a choice between hate and hope between the shackles of the past and the promise of the future.
It is a choice that must be made by leaders and by the people , and it is a choice that will define the future of a region that served as the cradle of civilization and a crucible of strife.
For all the challenges that lie ahead , we see many reasons to be hopeful.
In Egypt , we see it in the efforts of young people who led protests.
In Syria , we see it in the courage of those who brave bullets while chanting , peaceful , peaceful.
In Benghazi , a city threatened with destruction , we see it in the courthouse square where people gather to celebrate the freedoms that they had never known.
Across the region , those rights that we take for granted are being claimed with joy by those who are prying loose the grip of an iron fist.
For the American people , the scenes of upheaval in the region may be unsettling , but the forces driving it are not unfamiliar.
Our own nation was founded through a rebellion against an empire.
Our people fought a painful Civil War that extended freedom and dignity to those who were enslaved.
And I would not be standing here today unless past generations turned to the moral force of nonviolence as a way to perfect our union organizing , marching , protesting peacefully together to make real those words that declared our nation We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal.
Those words must guide our response to the change that is transforming the Middle East and North Africa words which tell us that repression will fail , and that tyrants will fall , and that every man and woman is endowed with certain inalienable rights.
It will not be easy.
There is no straight line to progress , and hardship always accompanies a season of hope.
But the United States of America was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves.
And now we cannot hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights , knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful , more stable , and more just.
Thank you very much , everybody.
Thank you.
.
Speaker , Vice President , members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress , as well as your new Speaker , John Boehner.
And as we mark this occasion , we are also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber , and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend Gabby Giffords.
It is no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years.
The debates have been contentious we have fought fiercely for our beliefs.
And that is a good thing.
That is what a robust democracy demands.
That is what helps set us apart as a nation.
But there is a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause.
Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate , Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from , each of us is a part of something greater something more consequential than party or political preference.
We are part of the American family.
We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found , we are still bound together as one people that we share common hopes and a common creed that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children , and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.
That , too , is what sets us apart as a nation.
Now , by itself , this simple recognition will not usher in a new era of cooperation.
What comes of this moment is up to us.
What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight , but whether we can work together tomorrow.
I believe we can.
And I believe we must.
That is what the people who sent us here expect of us.
With their votes , they have determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties.
New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans.
We will move forward together , or not at all for the challenges we face are bigger than party , and bigger than politics.
At stake right now is not who wins the next election after all , we just had an election.
At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country , or somewhere else.
It is whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded.
It is whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map , but the light to the world.
We are poised for progress.
Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known , the stock market has come roaring back.
Corporate profits are up.
The economy is growing again.
But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone.
We measure progress by the success of our people.
By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer.
By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise.
By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.
That is the project the American people want us to work on.
Together.
We did that in December.
Thanks to the tax cuts we passed , Americans paychecks are a little bigger today.
Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.
And these steps , taken by Democrats and Republicans , will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.
But we have to do more.
These steps we have taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession , but to win the future , we will need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.
Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.
You did not always need a degree , and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors.
If you worked hard , chances are you had have a job for life , with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion.
Maybe you had even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.
That world has changed.
And for many , the change has been painful.
I have seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories , and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets.
I have heard it in the frustrations of Americans who have seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.
They are right.
The rules have changed.
In a single generation , revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live , work and do business.
Steel mills that once needed 1 , 000 workers can now do the same work with 100.
Today , just about any company can set up shop , hire workers , and sell their products wherever there is an Internet connection.
Meanwhile , nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own , they could compete in this new world.
And so they started educating their children earlier and longer , with greater emphasis on math and science.
They are investing in research and new technologies.
Just recently , China became the home to the world s largest private solar research facility , and the world s fastest computer.
So , yes , the world has changed.
The competition for jobs is real.
But this should not discourage us.
It should challenge us.
Remember for all the hits we have taken these last few years , for all the naysayers predicting our decline , America still has the largest , most prosperous economy in the world.
No workers no workers are more productive than ours.
No country has more successful companies , or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs.
We are the home to the world s best colleges and universities , where more students come to study than any place on Earth.
What is more , we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny.
That is why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.
It is why our students do not just memorize equations , but answer questions like What do you think of that idea What would you change about the world What do you want to be when you grow up The future is ours to win.
But to get there , we cannot just stand still.
As Robert Kennedy told us , The future is not a gift.
It is an achievement.
Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat.
It has required each generation to sacrifice , and struggle , and meet the demands of a new age.
And now it is our turn.
We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time.
We need to out innovate , out educate , and out build the rest of the world.
We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.
We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government.
That is how our people will prosper.
That is how we will win the future.
And tonight , I had like to talk about how we get there.
The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.
None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from.
Thirty years ago , we could not know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution.
What we can do what America does better than anyone else is spark the creativity and imagination of our people.
We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers of Google and Facebook.
In America , innovation does not just change our lives.
It is how we make our living.
Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation.
But because it is not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research , throughout our history , our government has provided cutting edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need.
That is what planted the seeds for the Internet.
That is what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPJust think of all the good jobs from manufacturing to retail that have come from these breakthroughs.
Half a century ago , when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik , we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon.
The science was not even there yet.
NASA did not exist.
But after investing in better research and education , we did not just surpass the Soviets we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.
This is our generation s Sputnik moment.
Two years ago , I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we have not seen since the height of the Space Race.
And in a few weeks , I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal.
We will invest in biomedical research , information technology , and especially clean energy technology an investment that will strengthen our security , protect our planet , and create countless new jobs for our people.
Already , we are seeing the promise of renewable energy.
Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company.
After September 11th , they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon.
But half of their factory went unused , and the recession hit them hard.
Today , with the help of a government loan , that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country.
In Robert s words , We reinvented ourselves.
That is what Americans have done for over 200 years reinvented ourselves.
And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers , we have begun to reinvent our energy policy.
We are not just handing out money.
We are issuing a challenge.
We are telling America s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields , and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy , we will fund the Apollo projects of our time.
At the California Institute of Technology , they are developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars.
At Oak Ridge National Laboratory , they are using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities.
With more research and incentives , we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels , and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.
We need to get behind this innovation.
And to help pay for it , I am asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies.
I do not know if I do not know if you have noticed , but they are doing just fine on their own.
So instead of subsidizing yesterday s energy , let us invest in tomorrow s.
Now , clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they are selling.
So tonight , I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal By 2035 , 80 percent of America s electricity will come from clean energy sources.
Some folks want wind and solar.
Others want nuclear , clean coal and natural gas.
To meet this goal , we will need them all and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.
Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America s success.
But if we want to win the future if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.
Think about it.
Over the next 10 years , nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education.
And yet , as many as a quarter of our students are not even finishing high school.
The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.
America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.
And so the question is whether all of us as citizens , and as parents are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.
That responsibility begins not in our classrooms , but in our homes and communities.
It is family that first instills the love of learning in a child.
Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.
We need to teach our kids that it is not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated , but the winner of the science fair.
We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or Pbut of hard work and discipline.
Our schools share this responsibility.
When a child walks into a classroom , it should be a place of high expectations and high performance.
But too many schools do not meet this test.
That is why instead of just pouring money into a system that is not working , we launched a competition called Race to the Top.
To all 50 states , we said , If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement , we will show you the money.
Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.
For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year , it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning.
And these standards were developed , by the way , not by Washington , but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country.
And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and focused on what is best for our kids.
You see , we know what is possible from our children when reform is not just a top down mandate , but the work of local teachers and principals , school boards and communities.
Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver.
Three years ago , it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado located on turf between two rival gangs.
But last May , 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma.
Most will be the first in their families to go to college.
And after the first year of the school s transformation , the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said , Thank you , Waters , for showing that we are smart and we can make it.
That is what good schools can do , and we want good schools all across the country.
Let us also remember that after parents , the biggest impact on a child s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom.
In South Korea , teachers are known as nation builders.
Here in America , it is time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect.
We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.
And over the next 10 years , with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms , we want to prepare 100 , 000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math.
In fact , to every young person listening tonight who is contemplating their career choice If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher.
Your country needs you.
Of course , the education race does not end with a high school diploma.
To compete , higher education must be within the reach of every American.
That is why we have ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks , and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students.
And this year , I ask Congress to go further , and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth 10 , 000 for four years of college.
It is the right thing to do.
Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today s fast changing economy , we are also revitalizing America s community colleges.
Last month , I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina.
Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town.
One mother of two , a woman named Kathy Proctor , had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old.
And she told me she is earning her degree in biotechnology now , at 55 years old , not just because the furniture jobs are gone , but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams , too.
As Kathy said , I hope it tells them to never give up.
If we take these steps if we raise expectations for every child , and give them the best possible chance at an education , from the day they are born until the last job they take we will reach the goal that I set two years ago By the end of the decade , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.
One last point about education.
Today , there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens.
Some are the children of undocumented workers , who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents.
They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag , and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.
Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities.
But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees , we send them back home to compete against us.
It makes no sense.
Now , I strongly believe that we should take on , once and for all , the issue of illegal immigration.
And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders , enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.
I know that debate will be difficult.
I know it will take time.
But tonight , let us agree to make that effort.
And let us stop expelling talented , responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business , who could be further enriching this nation.
The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America.
To attract new businesses to our shores , we need the fastest , most reliable ways to move people , goods , and information from high speed rail to high speed Internet.
Our infrastructure used to be the best , but our lead has slipped.
South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do.
Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.
China is building faster trains and newer airports.
Meanwhile , when our own engineers graded our nation s infrastructure , they gave us a D.
We have to do better.
America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad , brought electricity to rural communities , constructed the Interstate Highway System.
The jobs created by these projects did not just come from laying down track or pavement.
They came from businesses that opened near a town s new train station or the new off ramp.
So over the last two years , we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century , a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard hit construction industry.
And tonight , I am proposing that we redouble those efforts.
We will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.
We will make sure this is fully paid for , attract private investment , and pick projects based what is best for the economy , not politicians.
Within 25 years , our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high speed rail.
This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car.
For some trips , it will be faster than flying without the pat down.
As we speak , routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.
Within the next five years , we will make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans.
This is not just about this is not about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls.
It is about connecting every part of America to the digital age.
It is about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world.
It is about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device a student who can take classes with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chats with her doctor.
All these investments in innovation , education , and infrastructure will make America a better place to do business and create jobs.
But to help our companies compete , we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.
For example , over the years , a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries.
Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all.
But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.
It makes no sense , and it has to change.
So tonight , I am asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system.
Get rid of the loopholes.
Level the playing field.
And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit.
It can be done.
To help businesses sell more products abroad , we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 because the more we export , the more jobs we create here at home.
Already , our exports are up.
Recently , we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250 , 000 jobs here in the United States.
And last month , we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70 , 000 American jobs.
This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor , Democrats and Republicans and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible.
Now , before I took office , I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements , and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs.
That is what we did with Korea , and that is what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks.
To reduce barriers to growth and investment , I have ordered a review of government regulations.
When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses , we will fix them.
But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common sense safeguards to protect the American people.
That is what we have done in this country for more than a century.
It is why our food is safe to eat , our water is safe to drink , and our air is safe to breathe.
It is why we have speed limits and child labor laws.
It is why last year , we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis.
And it is why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.
Now , I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.
So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.
If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable , I am eager to work with you.
We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.
What I am not willing to do what I am not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.
I am not willing to tell James Howard , a brain cancer patient from Texas , that his treatment might not be covered.
I am not willing to tell Jim Houser , a small business man from Oregon , that he has to go back to paying 5 , 000 more to cover his employees.
As we speak , this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients parents coverage.
So I say to this chamber tonight , instead of re fighting the battles of the last two years , let us fix what needs fixing and let us move forward.
Now , the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we are not buried under a mountain of debt.
We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.
And in the wake of the financial crisis , some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing , save jobs , and put money in people s pockets.
But now that the worst of the recession is over , we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in.
That is not sustainable.
Every day , families sacrifice to live within their means.
They deserve a government that does the same.
So tonight , I am proposing that starting this year , we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years.
Now , this would reduce the deficit by more than 400 billion over the next decade , and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.
This freeze will require painful cuts.
Already , we have frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years.
I have proposed cuts to things I care deeply about , like community action programs.
The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.
I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts , and I am willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without.
But let us make sure that we are not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.
And let us make sure that what we are cutting is really excess weight.
Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.
It may make you feel like you are flying high at first , but it will not take long before you feel the impact.
Now , most of the cuts and savings I have proposed only address annual domestic spending , which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget.
To make further progress , we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.
It will not.
The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.
I do not agree with all their proposals , but they made important progress.
And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it in domestic spending , defense spending , health care spending , and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.
This means further reducing health care costs , including programs like Medicare and Medicaid , which are the single biggest contributor to our long term deficit.
The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs , which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.
Still , I am willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs , including one that Republicans suggested last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.
To put us on solid ground , we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.
We must do it without putting at risk current retirees , the most vulnerable , or people with disabilities without slashing benefits for future generations and without subjecting Americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market.
And if we truly care about our deficit , we simply cannot afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.
Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students , we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.
It is not a matter of punishing their success.
It is about promoting America s success.
In fact , the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code.
This will be a tough job , but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this , and I am prepared to join them.
So now is the time to act.
Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress Democrats and Republicans to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done.
If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits , we can make the investments we need to win the future.
Let me take this one step further.
We should not just give our people a government that is more affordable.
We should give them a government that is more competent and more efficient.
We cannot win the future with a government of the past.
We live and do business in the Information Age , but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white TThere are 12 different agencies that deal with exports.
There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy.
Then there is my favorite example The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they are in fresh water , but the Commerce Department handles them when they are in saltwater.
I hear it gets even more complicated once they are smoked.
Now , we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste.
Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.
We are selling acres of federal office space that has not been used in years , and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more.
But we need to think bigger.
In the coming months , my administration will develop a proposal to merge , consolidate , and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America.
I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote and we will push to get it passed.
In the coming year , we will also work to rebuild people s faith in the institution of government.
Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent , you will be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history.
Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists , I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done put that information online.
And because the American people deserve to know that special interests are not larding up legislation with pet projects , both parties in Congress should know this If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside , I will veto it.
I will veto it.
The 21st century government that is open and competent.
A government that lives within its means.
An economy that is driven by new skills and new ideas.
Our success in this new and changing world will require reform , responsibility , and innovation.
It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.
Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders , so can new threats and new challenges.
No single wall separates East and West.
No one rival superpower is aligned against us.
And so we must defeat determined enemies , wherever they are , and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion.
And America s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity.
And because we have begun this work , tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America s standing has been restored.
Look to Iraq , where nearly 100 , 000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high.
American combat patrols have ended , violence is down , and a new government has been formed.
This year , our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people , while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq.
America s commitment has been kept.
The Iraq war is coming to an end.
Of course , as we speak , al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us.
Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals , we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.
And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders , we are responding with the strength of our communities , with respect for the rule of law , and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family.
We have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad.
In Afghanistan , our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces.
Our purpose is clear By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people , we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9 11.
Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians , fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency.
There will be tough fighting ahead , and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance.
But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.
This year , we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead.
And this July , we will begin to bring our troops home.
In Pakistan , al Qaeda s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001.
Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield.
Their safe havens are shrinking.
And we have sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe We will not relent , we will not waver , and we will defeat you.
American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.
Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty , far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed.
Because we rallied the world , nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists.
Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations , the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions , tighter sanctions than ever before.
And on the Korean Peninsula , we stand with our ally South Korea , and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.
This is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.
With our European allies , we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense.
We have reset our relationship with Russia , strengthened Asian alliances , built new partnerships with nations like India.
This March , I will travel to Brazil , Chile , and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas.
Around the globe , we are standing with those who take responsibility helping farmers grow more food , supporting doctors who care for the sick , and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.
Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power it must also be the purpose behind it.
In south Sudan with our assistance the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war.
Thousands lined up before dawn.
People danced in the streets.
One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him This was a battlefield for most of my life , he said.
Now we want to be free.
And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia , where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator.
And tonight , let us be clear The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia , and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.
We must never forget that the things we have struggled for , and fought for , live in the hearts of people everywhere.
And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country.
Tonight , let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families.
Let us serve them as well as they have served us by giving them the equipment they need , by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned , and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.
Our troops come from every corner of this country they are black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American.
They are Christian and Hindu , Jewish and Muslim.
And , yes , we know that some of them are gay.
Starting this year , no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love.
And with that change , I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTIt is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.
It is time to move forward as one nation.
We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us.
Reforming our schools , changing the way we use energy , reducing our deficit none of this will be easy.
All of it will take time.
And it will be harder because we will argue about everything.
The costs.
The details.
The letter of every law.
Of course , some countries do not have this problem.
If the central government wants a railroad , they build a railroad , no matter how many homes get bulldozed.
If they do not want a bad story in the newspaper , it does not get written.
And yet , as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be , I know there is not a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth.
We may have differences in policy , but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution.
We may have different opinions , but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try.
We may have different backgrounds , but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible.
No matter who you are.
No matter where you come from.
That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.
That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me.
That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth.
That dream that American Dream is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era.
It is what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future.
And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.
Brandon started a company in Berlin , Pennsylvania , that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology.
And one day last summer , he saw the news that halfway across the world , 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine , and no one knew how to save them.
But Brandon thought his company could help.
And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment.
And Brandon left for Chile.
Along with others , he began drilling a 2 , 000 foot hole into the ground , working three or four hour three or four days at a time without any sleep.
Thirty seven days later , Plan B succeeded , and the miners were rescued.
But because he did not want all of the attention , Brandon was not there when the miners emerged.
He had already gone back home , back to work on his next project.
And later , one of his employees said of the rescue , We proved that Center Rock is a little company , but we do big things.
We do big things.
From the earliest days of our founding , America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream.
That is how we win the future.
We are a nation that says , I might not have a lot of money , but I have this great idea for a new company.
I might not come from a family of college graduates , but I will be the first to get my degree.
I might not know those people in trouble , but I think I can help them , and I need to try.
I am not sure how we will reach that better place beyond the horizon , but I know we will get there.
I know we will.
We do big things.
The idea of America endures.
Our destiny remains our choice.
And tonight , more than two centuries later , it is because of our people that our future is hopeful , our journey goes forward , and the state of our union is strong.
Thank you.
God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America.
.
Thank you.
Thank you , Governor.
To all the families , first responders , to the community of Newtown , clergy , guests Scripture tells us hellip do not lose heart.
Though outwardly we are wasting away hellip inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal.
For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , an eternal house in heaven , not built by human hands.
We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults.
They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America.
Here in Newtown , I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation.
I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow , nor can they heal your wounded hearts.
I can only hope it helps for you to know that you are not alone in your grief that our world too has been torn apart that all across this land of ours , we have wept with you , we have pulled our children tight.
And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide , we will provide whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load , we will gladly bear it.
Newtown you are not alone.
As these difficult days have unfolded , you have also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice.
We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary , the school s staff did not flinch , they did not hesitate.
Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach , Vicki Soto , Lauren Rousseau , Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances with courage and with love , giving their lives to protect the children in their care.
We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms , and kept steady through it all , and reassured their students by saying wait for the good guys , they are coming show me your smile.
And we know that good guys came.
The first responders who raced to the scene , helping to guide those in harm s way to safety , and comfort those in need , holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do , and others needed them more.
And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren , helping one another , holding each other , dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do one child even trying to encourage a grown up by saying , I know karate.
So it is okay.
I will lead the way out.
As a community , you have inspired us , Newtown.
In the face of indescribable violence , in the face of unconscionable evil , you have looked out for each other , and you have cared for one another , and you have loved one another.
This is how Newtown will be remembered.
And with time , and God s grace , that love will see you through.
But we , as a nation , we are left with some hard questions.
Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time , walking around.
With their very first cry , this most precious , vital part of ourselves our child is suddenly exposed to the world , to possible mishap or malice.
And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm.
And yet , we also know that with that child s very first step , and each step after that , they are separating from us that we will not that we cannot always be there for them.
They will suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments.
And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self reliant and capable and resilient , ready to face the world without fear.
And we know we cannot do this by ourselves.
It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize , no matter how much you love these kids , you cannot do it by yourself.
That this job of keeping our children safe , and teaching them well , is something we can only do together , with the help of friends and neighbors , the help of a community , and the help of a nation.
And in that way , we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we are counting on everybody else to help look after ours that we are all parents that they are all our children.
This is our first task caring for our children.
It is our first job.
If we do not get that right , we do not get anything right.
That is how , as a society , we will be judged.
And by that measure , can we truly say , as a nation , that we are meeting our obligations Can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our children all of them safe from harm Can we claim , as a nation , that we are all together there , letting them know that they are loved , and teaching them to love in return Can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose I have been reflecting on this the last few days , and if we are honest with ourselves , the answer is no.
We are not doing enough.
And we will have to change.
Since I have been President , this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting.
The fourth time we have hugged survivors.
The fourth time we have consoled the families of victims.
And in between , there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country , almost daily reports of victims , many of them children , in small towns and big cities all across America victims whose much of the time , their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
We cannot tolerate this anymore.
These tragedies must end.
And to end them , we must change.
We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex , and that is true.
No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world , or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society.
But that cannot be an excuse for inaction.
Surely , we can do better than this.
If there is even one step we can take to save another child , or another parent , or another town , from the grief that has visited Tucson , and Aurora , and Oak Creek , and Newtown , and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that then surely we have an obligation to try.
In the coming weeks , I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.
Because what choice do we have We cannot accept events like this as routine.
Are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom All the world s religions so many of them represented here today start with a simple question Why are we here What gives our life meaning What gives our acts purpose We know our time on this Earth is fleeting.
We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain that even after we chase after some earthly goal , whether it is wealth or power or fame , or just simple comfort , we will , in some fashion , fall short of what we had hoped.
We know that no matter how good our intentions , we will all stumble sometimes , in some way.
We will make mistakes , we will experience hardships.
And even when we are trying to do the right thing , we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness , so often unable to discern God s heavenly plans.
There is only one thing we can be sure of , and that is the love that we have for our children , for our families , for each other.
The warmth of a small child s embrace that is true.
The memories we have of them , the joy that they bring , the wonder we see through their eyes , that fierce and boundless love we feel for them , a love that takes us out of ourselves , and binds us to something larger we know that is what matters.
We know we are always doing right when we are taking care of them , when we are teaching them well , when we are showing acts of kindness.
We do not go wrong when we do that.
That is what we can be sure of.
And that is what you , the people of Newtown , have reminded us.
That is how you have inspired us.
You remind us what matters.
And that is what should drive us forward in everything we do , for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth.
Let the little children come to me , Jesus said , and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.

May God bless and keep those we have lost in His heavenly place.
May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort.
And may He bless and watch over this community , and the United States of America.

Speaker , Vice President , members of Congress , fellow citizens Fifty one years ago , John Kennedy declared to this chamber that the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.
It is my task , he said , to report the State of the Union to improve it is the task of us all.
Tonight , thanks to the grit and determination of the American people , there is much progress to report.
After a decade of grinding war , our brave men and women in uniform are coming home.
After years of grueling recession , our businesses have created over six million new jobs.
We buy more American cars than we have in five years , and less foreign oil than we have in 20.
Our housing market is healing , our stock market is rebounding , and consumers , patients , and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.
So , together , we have cleared away the rubble of crisis , and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger.
But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.
Our economy is adding jobs but too many people still cannot find full time employment.
Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all time highs but for more than a decade , wages and incomes have barely budged.
It is our generation s task , then , to reignite the true engine of America s economic growth a rising , thriving middle class.
It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities , you can get ahead , no matter where you come from , no matter what you look like , or who you love.
It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many , and not just the few that it encourages free enterprise , rewards individual initiative , and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.
The American people do not expect government to solve every problem.
They do not expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.
But they do expect us to put the nation s interests before party.
They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.
For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together , and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.
Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.
Over the last few years , both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than 2.
5 trillion mostly through spending cuts , but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
As a result , we are more than halfway towards the goal of 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.
Now we need to finish the job.
And the question is , how In 2011 , Congress passed a law saying that if both parties could not agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal , about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.
These sudden , harsh , arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.
They had devastate priorities like education , and energy , and medical research.
They would certainly slow our recovery , and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.
That is why Democrats , Republicans , business leaders , and economists have already said that these cuts , known here in Washington as the sequester , are a really bad idea.
Now , some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training , Medicare and Social Security benefits.
That idea is even worse.
Yes , the biggest driver of our long term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.
And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms otherwise , our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children , and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.
But we cannot ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.
We will not grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling , or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters.
Most Americans Democrats , Republicans , and independents understand that we cannot just cut our way to prosperity.
They know that broad based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction , with spending cuts and revenue , and with everybody doing their fair share.
And that is the approach I offer tonight.
On Medicare , I am prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson Bowles commission.
Already , the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.
And the reforms I am proposing go even further.
We will reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.
We will bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare , because our medical bills should not be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.
And I am open to additional reforms from both parties , so long as they do not violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.
Our government should not make promises we cannot keep but we must keep the promises we have already made.
To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target , we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested , and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well off and the well connected.
After all , why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks How is that fair Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes How does that promote growth Now is our best chance for bipartisan , comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.
We can get this done.
The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms , and more time expanding and hiring a tax code that ensures billionaires with high powered accountants cannot work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas , and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.
That is what tax reform can deliver.
That is what we can do together.
I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy.
The politics will be hard for both sides.
None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.
But the alternative will cost us jobs , hurt our economy , visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.
So let us set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.
And let us do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.
The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.
We cannot do it.
Let us agree right here , right now to keep the people s government open , and pay our bills on time , and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
The American people have worked too hard , for too long , rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.
Now , most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda.
But let us be clear , deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.
A growing economy that creates good , middle class jobs that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.
Every day , we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation How do we attract more jobs to our shores How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living A year and a half ago , I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.
And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda.
I urge this Congress to pass the rest.
But tonight , I will lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.
Let me repeat nothing I am proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.
It is not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad based growth.
That is what we should be looking for.
Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.
After shedding jobs for more than 10 years , our manufacturers have added about 500 , 000 jobs over the past three.
Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.
Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico.
And this year , Apple will start making Macs in America again.
There are things we can do , right now , to accelerate this trend.
Last year , we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown , Ohio.
A once shuttered warehouse is now a state of the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.
There is no reason this cannot happen in other towns.
So tonight , I am announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs , where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high tech jobs.
And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.
We can get that done.
Now , if we want to make the best products , we also have to invest in the best ideas.
Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned 140 to our economy every dollar.
Today , our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer s.
They are developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful.
Now is not the time to gut these job creating investments in science and innovation.
Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.
We need to make those investments.
Today , no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.
After years of talking about it , we are finally poised to control our own energy future.
We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.
We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas , and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it.
We produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone s energy bill is lower because of it.
And over the last four years , our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.
But for the sake of our children and our future , we must do more to combat climate change.
Now , it is true that no single event makes a trend.
But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.
Heat waves , droughts , wildfires , floods all are now more frequent and more intense.
We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence.
Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it is too late.
Now , the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.
I urge this Congress to get together , pursue a bipartisan , market based solution to climate change , like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.
But if Congress will not act soon to protect future generations , I will.
I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
Four years ago , other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it.
And we have begun to change that.
Last year , wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America.
So let us generate even more.
Solar energy gets cheaper by the year let us drive down costs even further.
As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy , so must we.
Now , in the meantime , the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence.
We need to encourage that.
And that is why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits.
That is got to be part of an all of the above plan.
But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.
In fact , much of our new found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we , the public , own together.
So tonight , I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.
If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea , then so can we.
Let us take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we have put up with for far too long.
I am also issuing a new goal for America Let us cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.
We will work with the states to do it.
Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen.
America s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.
Ask any CEO where they had rather locate and hire a country with deteriorating roads and bridges , or one with high speed rail and Internet high tech schools , self healing power grids.
The CEO of Siemens America a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina said that if we upgrade our infrastructure , they will bring even more jobs.
And that is the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world.
And I know you want these job creating projects in your district.
I have seen all those ribbon cuttings.
So tonight , I propose a Fix It First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs , like the nearly 70 , 000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.
And to make sure taxpayers do not shoulder the whole burden , I am also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most modern ports to move our goods , modern pipelines to withstand a storm , modern schools worthy of our children.
Let us prove that there is no better place to do business than here in the United States of America , and let us start right away.
We can get this done.
And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.
The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.
Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years.
Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent , and construction is expanding again.
But even with mortgage rates near a 50 year low , too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.
Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.
That is holding our entire economy back.
We need to fix it.
Right now , there is a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save 3 , 000 a year by refinancing at today s rates.
Democrats and Republicans have supported it before , so what are we waiting for Take a vote , and send me that bill.
Why would we be against that Why would that be a partisan issue , helping folks refinance Right now , overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.
What is holding us back Let us streamline the process , and help our economy grow.
These initiatives in manufacturing , energy , infrastructure , housing all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs.
But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.
And that has to start at the earliest possible age.
Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning , the better he or she does down the road.
But today , fewer than 3 in 10 four year olds are enrolled in a high quality preschool program.
Most middle class parents cannot afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool.
And for poor kids who need help the most , this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.
So tonight , I propose working with states to make high quality preschool available to every single child in America.
That is something we should be able to do.
Every dollar we invest in high quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on by boosting graduation rates , reducing teen pregnancy , even reducing violent crime.
In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children , like Georgia or Oklahoma , studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level , graduate high school , hold a job , form more stable families of their own.
We know this works.
So let us do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.
Let us give our kids that chance.
Let us also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job.
Right now , countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges.
So those German kids , they are ready for a job when they graduate high school.
They have been trained for the jobs that are there.
Now at schools like P Tech in Brooklyn , a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBstudents will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate s degree in computers or engineering.
We need to give every American student opportunities like this.
And four years ago , we started Race to the Top a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards , all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year.
Tonight , I am announcing a new challenge to redesign America s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high tech economy.
And we will reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers , and create classes that focus on science , technology , engineering and math the skills today s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.
Now , even with better high schools , most young people will need some higher education.
It is a simple fact the more education you have got , the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class.
But today , skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education , or saddle them with unsustainable debt.
Through tax credits , grants and better loans , we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years.
But taxpayers cannot keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education.
Colleges must do their part to keep costs down , and it is our job to make sure that they do.
So tonight , I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.
And tomorrow , my administration will release a new College Scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.
Now , to grow our middle class , our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today s jobs require.
But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who is willing to work everybody who is willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead.
Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving , hopeful immigrants.
And right now , leaders from the business , labor , law enforcement , faith communities they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
Now is the time to do it.
Now is the time to get it done.
Now is the time to get it done.
Real reform means strong border security , and we can build on the progress my administration has already made putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.
Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship a path that includes passing a background check , paying taxes and a meaningful penalty , learning English , and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.
And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.
In other words , we know what needs to be done.
And as we speak , bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill , and I applaud their efforts.
So let us get this done.
Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months , and I will sign it right away.
And America will be better for it.
Let us get it done.
Let us get it done.
But we cannot stop there.
We know our economy is stronger when our wives , our mothers , our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace , and free from the fear of domestic violence.
Today , the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago.
And I now urge the House to do the same.
Good job , Joe.
And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts , and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.
We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day s work with honest wages.
But today , a full time worker making the minimum wage earns 14 , 500 a year.
Even with the tax relief we put in place , a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line.
That is wrong.
That is why , since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage , 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.
Tonight , let us declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth , no one who works full time should have to live in poverty , and raise the federal minimum wage to 9.
00 an hour.
We should be able to get that done.
This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.
It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank rent or eviction scraping by or finally getting ahead.
For businesses across the country , it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.
And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government.
In fact , working folks should not have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.
So here s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year let us tie the minimum wage to the cost of living , so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.
Tonight , let us also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work , it is virtually impossible to get ahead.
Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up.
Inescapable pockets of poverty , urban and rural , where young adults are still fighting for their first job.
America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny.
And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.
Let us offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who have got what it takes to fill that job opening , but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore.
Let us put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run down neighborhoods.
And this year , my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet.
We will work with local leaders to target resources at public safety , and education , and housing.
We will give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.
And we will work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low income couples , and do more to encourage fatherhood because what makes you a man is not the ability to conceive a child it is having the courage to raise one.
And we want to encourage that.
We want to help that.
Stronger families.
Stronger communities.
A stronger America.
It is this kind of prosperity broad , shared , built on a thriving middle class that has always been the source of our progress at home.
It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.
Tonight , we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us.
Because of them , we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda.
Already , we have brought home 33 , 000 of our brave servicemen and women.
This spring , our forces will move into a support role , while Afghan security forces take the lead.
Tonight , I can announce that over the next year , another 34 , 000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan.
This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year , our war in Afghanistan will be over.
Beyond 2014 , America s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure , but the nature of our commitment will change.
We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.
Today , the organization that attacked us on 9 11 is a shadow of its former self.
It is true , different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.
The threat these groups pose is evolving.
But to meet this threat , we do not need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations.
Instead , we will need to help countries like Yemen , and Libya , and Somalia provide for their own security , and help allies who take the fight to terrorists , as we have in Mali.
And where necessary , through a range of capabilities , we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.
Now , as we do , we must enlist our values in the fight.
That is why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts.
Throughout , we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts.
I recognize that in our democracy , no one should just take my word for it that we are doing things the right way.
So in the months ahead , I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting , detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances , but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.
Of course , our challenges do not end with al Qaeda.
America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world s most dangerous weapons.
The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.
Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them , as we stand by our allies , strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.
Likewise , the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution , because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations , and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.
At the same time , we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals , and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations.
America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks.
Now , we know hackers steal people s identities and infiltrate private emails.
We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.
Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid , our financial institutions , our air traffic control systems.
We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.
And that is why , earlier today , I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing , and developing standards to protect our national security , our jobs , and our privacy.
But now Congress must act as well , by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.
This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis.
Now , even as we protect our people , we should remember that today s world presents not just dangers , not just threats , it presents opportunities.
To boost American exports , support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia , we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans Pacific Partnership.
And tonight , I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good paying American jobs.
We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all not only because it creates new markets , more stable order in certain regions of the world , but also because it is the right thing to do.
In many places , people live on little more than a dollar a day.
So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy by empowering women by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve , and helping communities to feed , and power , and educate themselves by saving the world s children from preventable deaths and by realizing the promise of an AIDS free generation , which is within our reach.
You see , America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change.
I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon , in Burma , when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years when thousands of Burmese lined the streets , waving American flags , including a man who said , There is justice and law in the United States.
I want our country to be like that.
In defense of freedom , we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa from Europe to Asia.
In the Middle East , we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights , and support stable transitions to democracy.
We know the process will be messy , and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt , but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people.
We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people , and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian.
And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace.
These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.
And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk our diplomats , our intelligence officers , and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
As long as I am Commander in Chief , we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad , and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known.
We will invest in new capabilities , even as we reduce waste and wartime spending.
We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers , and equal benefits for their families gay and straight.
We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms , because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat.
We will keep faith with our veterans , investing in world class care , including mental health care , for our wounded warriors supporting our military families giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned.
And I want to thank my wife , Michelle , and Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us.
Thank you , honey.
Thank you , Jill.
Defending our freedom , though , is not just the job of our military alone.
We must all do our part to make sure our God given rights are protected here at home.
That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote.
When any American , no matter where they live or what their party , are denied that right because they cannot afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot , we are betraying our ideals.
So tonight , I am announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America.
And it definitely needs improvement.
I am asking two long time experts in the field who , by the way , recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney s campaign to lead it.
We can fix this , and we will.
The American people demand it , and so does our democracy.
Of course , what I have said tonight matters little if we do not come together to protect our most precious resource our children.
It has been two months since Newtown.
I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence.
But this time is different.
Overwhelming majorities of Americans Americans who believe in the Second Amendment have come together around common sense reform , like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.
Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals.
Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets , because these police chiefs , they are tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.
Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.
Now , if you want to vote no , that is your choice.
But these proposals deserve a vote.
Because in the two months since Newtown , more than a thousand birthdays , graduations , anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun more than a thousand.
One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.
She was 15 years old.
She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.
She was a majorette.
She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend.
Just three weeks ago , she was here , in Washington , with her classmates , performing for her country at my inauguration.
And a week later , she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school , just a mile away from my house.
Hadiya s parents , Nate and Cleo , are in this chamber tonight , along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.
They deserve a vote.
They deserve a vote.
Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.
The families of Newtown deserve a vote.
The families of Aurora deserve a vote.
The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg , and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote.
They deserve a simple vote.
Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.
In fact , no laws , no initiatives , no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I have outlined tonight.
But we were never sent here to be perfect.
We were sent here to make what difference we can , to secure this nation , expand opportunity , uphold our ideals through the hard , often frustrating , but absolutely necessary work of self government.
We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another , every single day , usually without fanfare , all across this country.
We should follow their example.
We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez.
When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness , she was not thinking about how her own home was faring.
Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.
We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor.
When Desiline arrived at her polling place , she was told the wait to vote might be six hours.
And as time ticked by , her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet , but whether folks like her would get to have their say.
And hour after hour , a throng of people stayed in line to support her because Desiline is 102 years old.
And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read , I voted.
We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.
When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive , he did not consider his own safety.
He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside , even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds.
And when asked how he did that , Brian said , That is just the way we are made.
That is just the way we are made.
We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms , and hold different views than the person beside us.
But as Americans , we all share the same proud title we are citizens.
It is a word that does not just describe our nationality or legal status.
It describes the way we are made.
It describes what we believe.
It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations , that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others and that well into our third century as a nation , it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these United States , to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story.
Thank you.
God bless you , and God bless these United States of America.
.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Well , it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem , and I am so grateful for the welcome that I have received from the people of Israel.
Thank you.
I bring with me the support of the American people and the friendship that binds us together.
Over the last two days , I have reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres.
I have borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book , and I have seen Israel s shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs.
This is a nation of museums and patents , timeless holy sites and ground breaking innovation.
Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology on board the Mars Rover originated at the same time.
But what I have most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you , the Israeli people especially so many young people who are here today to talk about the history that brought us here today , and the future that you will make in the years to come.
Now , I know that in Israel s vibrant democracy , every word , every gesture is carefully scrutinized.
But I want to clear something up just so you know any drama between me and my friend , Bibi , over the years was just a plot to create material for Eretz Nehederet.
That is the only thing that was going on.
We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material.
I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday the celebration of Passover.
And that is where I would like to begin today.
Just a few days from now , Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the Seder table , and celebrate with songs , wine and symbolic foods.
After enjoying Seders with family and friends in Chicago and on the campaign trail , I am proud that I have now brought this tradition into the White House.
I did so because I wanted my daughters to experience the Haggadah , and the story at the center of Passover that makes this time of year so powerful.
It is a story of centuries of slavery , and years of wandering in the desert a story of perseverance amidst persecution , and faith in God and the Torah.
It is a story about finding freedom in your own land.
And for the Jewish people , this story is central to who you have become.
But it is also a story that holds within it the universal human experience , with all of its suffering , but also all of its salvation.
It is a part of the three great religions Judaism , Christianity , and Islam that trace their origins to Abraham , and see Jerusalem as sacred.
And it is a story that is inspired communities across the globe , including me and my fellow Americans.
In the United States a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew we are naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land.
To African Americans , the story of the Exodus was perhaps the central story , the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today.
For generations , this promise helped people weather poverty and persecution , while holding on to the hope that a better day was on the horizon.
For me , personally , growing up in far flung parts of the world and without firm roots , the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.
Of course , even as we draw strength from the story of God s will and His gift of freedom expressed on Passover , we also know that here on Earth we must bear our responsibilities in an imperfect world.
That means accepting our measure of sacrifice and struggle , just like previous generations.
It means us working through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom.
As Martin Luther King said on the day before he was killed , I may not get there with you.
But I want you to know that we , as a people , will get to the promised land.
So just as Joshua carried on after Moses , the work goes on for all of you , the Joshua Generation , for justice and dignity for opportunity and freedom.
For the Jewish people , the journey to the promise of the State of Israel wound through countless generations.
It involved centuries of suffering and exile , prejudice and pogroms and even genocide.
Through it all , the Jewish people sustained their unique identity and traditions , as well as a longing to return home.
And while Jews achieved extraordinary success in many parts of the world , the dream of true freedom finally found its full expression in the Zionist idea to be a free people in your homeland.
That is why I believe that Israel is rooted not just in history and tradition , but also in a simple and profound idea the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own.
Over the last 65 years , when Israel has been at its best , Israelis have demonstrated that responsibility does not end when you reach the promised land , it only begins.
And so Israel has been a refuge for the diaspora welcoming Jews from Europe , from the former Soviet Union , from Ethiopia , from North Africa.
Israel has built a prosperous nation through kibbutzeem that made the desert bloom , business that broadened the middle class , innovators who reached new frontiers , from the smallest microchip to the orbits of space.
Israel has established a thriving democracy , with a spirited civil society and proud political parties , and a tireless free press , and a lively public debate lively may even be an understatement.
And Israel has achieved all this even as it is overcome relentless threats to its security through the courage of the Israel Defense Forces , and the citizenry that is so resilient in the face of terror.
This is the story of Israel.
This is the work that has brought the dreams of so many generations to life.
And every step of the way , Israel has built unbreakable bonds of friendship with my country , the United States of America.
Those ties began only 11 minutes after Israeli independence , when the United States was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel.
As President Truman said in explaining his decision to recognize Israel , he said , I believe it has a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation , but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.
And since then , we have built a friendship that advances our shared interests.
Together , we share a commitment to security for our citizens and the stability of the Middle East and North Africa.
Together , we share a focus on advancing economic growth around the globe , and strengthening the middle class within our own countries.
Together , we share a stake in the success of democracy.
But the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests , just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders.
America is a nation of immigrants.
America is strengthened by diversity.
America is enriched by faith.
We are governed not simply by men and women , but by laws.
We are fueled by entrepreneurship and innovation , and we are defined by a democratic discourse that allows each generation to reimagine and renew our union once more.
So in Israel , we see values that we share , even as we recognize what makes us different.
That is an essential part of our bond.
Now , I stand here today mindful that for both our nations , these are some complicated times.
We have difficult issues to work through within our own countries , and we face dangers and upheaval around the world.
And when I look at young people within the United States , I think about the choices that they must make in their lives to define who we will be as a nation in this 21st century , particularly as we emerge from two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression.
But part of the reason I like talking to young people is because no matter how great the challenges are , their idealism , their energy , their ambition always gives me hope.
And I see the same spirit in the young people here today.
I believe that you will shape our future.
And given the ties between our countries , I believe your future is bound to ours.
No , no this is part of the lively debate that we talked about.
This is good.
You know , I have to say we actually arranged for that , because it made me feel at home.
I would not feel comfortable if I did not have at least one heckler.
I had like to focus on how we and when I say we , in particular young people can work together to make progress in three areas that will define our times security , peace and prosperity.
Let me begin with security.
I am proud that the security relationship between the United States and Israel has never been stronger.
Never.
More exercises between our militaries more exchanges among our political and military and intelligence officials than ever before the largest program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge.
These are the facts.
These are not my opinions , these are facts.
But , to me , this is not simply measured on a balance sheet.
I know that here , in Israel , security is something personal.
Here s what I think about when I consider these issues.
When I consider Israel s security , I think about children like Osher Twito , who I met in Sderot children the same age as my own daughters who went to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they are and where they live.
That reality is why we have invested in the Iron Dome system to save countless lives because those children deserve to sleep better at night.
That is why we have made it clear , time and again , that Israel cannot accept rocket attacks from Gaza , and we have stood up for Israel s right to defend itself.
And that is why Israel has a right to expect Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel s right to exist.
When I think about Israel s security , I think about five Israelis who boarded a bus in Bulgaria , who were blown up because of where they came from robbed of the ability to live , and love , and raise families.
That is why every country that values justice should call Hizbollah what it truly is a terrorist organization.
Because the world cannot tolerate an organization that murders innocent civilians , stockpiles rockets to shoot at cities , and supports the massacre of men and women and children in Syria right now.
The fact that Hizbollah s ally the Assad regime has stockpiles of chemical weapons only heightens the urgency.
We will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger.
I have made it clear to Bashar al Assad and all who follow his orders We will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people , or the transfer of those weapons to terrorists.
The world is watching we will hold you accountable.
The Syrian people have the right to be freed from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power.
Assad must go so that Syria s future can begin.
Because true stability in Syria depends upon establishing a government that is responsible to its people one that protects all communities within its borders , while making peace with countries beyond them.
These are the things I think about when I think about Israel s security.
When I consider Israel s security , I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust , faced with the prospect of a nuclear armed Iranian government that has called for Israel s destruction.
It is no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat.
But this is not simply a challenge for Israel it is a danger for the entire world , including the United States.
A nuclear armed Iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism.
It would undermine the non proliferation regime.
It would spark an arms race in a volatile region.
And it would embolden a government that has shown no respect for the rights of its own people or the responsibilities of nations.
That is why America has built a coalition to increase the cost to Iran of failing to meet their obligations.
The Iranian government is now under more pressure than ever before , and that pressure is increasing.
It is isolated.
Its economy is in dire straits.
Its leadership is divided.
And its position in the region , and the world has only grown weaker.
I do believe that all of us have an interest in resolving this issue peacefully.
Strong and principled diplomacy is the best way to ensure that the Iranian government forsakes nuclear weapons.
Peace is far more preferable to war.
And the inevitable costs , the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically.
Because of the cooperation between our governments , we know that there remains time to pursue a diplomatic resolution.
That is what America will do , with clear eyes working with a world that is united , and with the sense of urgency that is required.
But Iran must know this time is not unlimited.
And I have made the position of the United States of America clear Iran must not get a nuclear weapon.
This is not a danger that can be contained , and as President , I have said all options are on the table for achieving our objectives.
America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear armed Iran.
For young Israelis , I know that these issues of security are rooted in an experience that is even more fundamental than the pressing threat of the day.
You live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbors have rejected the right of your nation to exist.
Your grandparents had to risk their lives and all that they had to make a place for themselves in this world.
Your parents lived through war after war to ensure the survival of the Jewish state.
Your children grow up knowing that people they have never met may hate them because of who they are , in a region that is full of turmoil and changing underneath your feet.
So that is what I think about when Israel is faced with these challenges that sense of an Israel that is surrounded by many in this region who still reject it , and many in the world who refuse to accept it.
And that is why the security of the Jewish people in Israel is so important.
It cannot be taken for granted.
But make no mistake those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel s right to exist , they might as well reject the earth beneath them or the sky above , because Israel is not going anywhere.
And today , I want to tell you particularly the young people so that there is no mistake here , so long as there is a United States of America Atem lo levad.
You are not alone.
The question is what kind of future Israel will look forward to.
Israel is not going anywhere but especially for the young people in this audience , the question is what does its future hold And that brings me to the subject of peace.
I know Israel has taken risks for peace.
Brave leaders Menachem Begin , Yitzhak Rabin reached treaties with two of your neighbors.
You made credible proposals to the Palestinians at Annapolis.
You withdrew from Gaza and Lebanon , and then faced terror and rockets.
Across the region , you have extended a hand of friendship and all too often you have been confronted with rejection and , in some cases , the ugly reality of anti Semitism.
So I believe that the Israeli people do want peace , and I also understand why too many Israelis maybe an increasing number , maybe a lot of young people here today are skeptical that it can be achieved.
But today , Israel is at a crossroads.
It can be tempting to put aside the frustrations and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of peace , particularly when Iron Dome repels rockets , barriers keep out suicide bombers.
There is so many other pressing issues that demand your attention.
And I know that only Israelis can make the fundamental decisions about your country s future.
I recognize that.
I also know , by the way , that not everyone in this hall will agree with what I have to say about peace.
I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace , but question its underlying premise , have a different vision for Israel s future.
And that is part of a democracy.
That is part of the discourse between our two countries.
I recognize that.
But I also believe it is important to be open and honest , especially with your friends.
I also believe that.
Politically , given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America , the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside just express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do that would be the easiest political path.
But I want you to know that I speak to you as a friend who is deeply concerned and committed to your future , and I ask you to consider three points.
First , peace is necessary.
I believe that.
I believe that peace is the only path to true security.
You have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream , or you can face a growing challenge to its future.
Given the demographics west of the Jordan River , the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine.
That is true.
There are other factors involved.
Given the frustration in the international community about this conflict , Israel needs to reverse an undertow of isolation.
And given the march of technology , the only way to truly protect the Israeli people over the long term is through the absence of war.
Because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that is intent on doing so from inflicting harm.
And this truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world.
I understand that with the uncertainty in the region people in the streets , changes in leadership , the rise of non secular parties in politics it is tempting to turn inward , because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic.
But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace.
Because as more governments respond to popular will , the days when Israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leaders , those days are over.
Peace will have to be made among peoples , not just governments.
No one no single step can change overnight what lies in the hearts and minds of millions.
No single step is going to erase years of history and propaganda.
But progress with the Palestinians is a powerful way to begin , while sidelining extremists who thrive on conflict and thrive on division.
It would make a difference.
So peace is necessary.
But peace is also just.
Peace is also just.
There is no question that Israel has faced Palestinian factions who turned to terror , leaders who missed historic opportunities.
That is all true.
And that is why security must be at the center of any agreement.
And there is no question that the only path to peace is through negotiations which is why , despite the criticism we have received , the United States will oppose unilateral efforts to bypass negotiations through the United Nations.
It has to be done by the parties.
But the Palestinian people s right to self determination , their right to justice , must also be recognized.
Put yourself in their shoes.
Look at the world through their eyes.
It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of their own.
Living their entire lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements not just of those young people but their parents , their grandparents , every single day.
It is not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished.
It is not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands or restricting a student s ability to move around the West Bank or displace Palestinian families from their homes.
Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer.
Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland , Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land.
I am going off script here for a second , but before I came here , I met with a group of young Palestinians from the age of 15 to 22.
And talking to them , they were not that different from my daughters.
They were not that different from your daughters or sons.
I honestly believe that if any Israeli parent sat down with those kids , they had say , I want these kids to succeed I want them to prosper.
I want them to have opportunities just like my kids do.
I believe that is what Israeli parents would want for these kids if they had a chance to listen to them and talk to them.
I believe that.
Now , only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have.
But remember that as you make these decisions , you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the Palestinians you will define the future of Israel as well.
As Ariel Sharon said I am quoting him It is impossible to have a Jewish democratic state , at the same time to control all of Eretz Israel.
If we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety , we are liable to lose it all.
Or , from a different perspective , I think of what the novelist David Grossman said shortly after losing his son , as he described the necessity of peace A peace of no choice he said , must be approached with the same determination and creativity as one approaches a war of no choice.
Now , Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with anyone who is dedicated to its destruction.
But while I know you have had differences with the Palestinian Authority , I genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad.
I believe that.
And they have a track record to prove it.
Over the last few years , they have built institutions and maintained security on the West Bank in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago.
So many Palestinians including young people have rejected violence as a means of achieving their aspirations.
There is an opportunity there , there is a window which brings me to my third point Peace is possible.
It is possible.
I am not saying it is guaranteed.
I cannot even say that it is more likely than not.
But it is possible.
I know it does not seem that way.
There are always going to be reasons to avoid risk.
There are costs for failure.
There will always be extremists who provide an excuse not to act.
I know there must be something exhausting about endless talks about talks , and daily controversies , and just the grinding status quo.
And I am sure there is a temptation just to say , Ah , enough.
Let me focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what I can control.
But it is possible.
Negotiations will be necessary , but there is little secret about where they must lead two states for two peoples.
Two states for two peoples.
There will be differences about how to get there.
There are going to be hard choices along the way.
Arab states must adapt to a world that has changed.
The days when they could condemn Israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity , or government corruption or mismanagement those days need to be over.
Now is the time for the Arab world to take steps toward normalizing relations with Israel.
Meanwhile , Palestinians must recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security.
Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace , and that an independent Palestine must be viable with real borders that have to be drawn.
I have suggested principles on territory and security that I believe can be the basis for these talks.
But for the moment , put aside the plans and the process.
I ask you , instead , to think about what can be done to build trust between people.
Four years ago , I stood in Cairo in front of an audience of young people politically , religiously , they must seem a world away.
But the things they want , they are not so different from what the young people here want.
They want the ability to make their own decisions and to get an education , get a good job to worship God in their own way to get married to raise a family.
The same is true of those young Palestinians that I met with this morning.
The same is true for young Palestinians who yearn for a better life in Gaza.
That is where peace begins not just in the plans of leaders , but in the hearts of people.
Not just in some carefully designed process , but in the daily connections that sense of empathy that takes place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of Jerusalem.
And let me say this as a politician I can promise you this , political leaders will never take risks if the people do not push them to take some risks.
You must create the change that you want to see.
Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things.
I know this is possible.
Look to the bridges being built in business and civil society by some of you here today.
Look at the young people who have not yet learned a reason to mistrust , or those young people who have learned to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherited from their parents , because they simply recognize that we hold more hopes in common than fears that drive us apart.
Your voices must be louder than those who would drown out hope.
Your hopes must light the way forward.
Look to a future in which Jews and Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land.
Believe in that.
And most of all , look to the future that you want for your own children a future in which a Jewish , democratic , vibrant state is protected and accepted for this time and for all time.
There will be many who say this change is not possible , but remember this Israel is the most powerful country in this region.
Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world.
Israel is not going anywhere.
Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is , but this is in your nature Israel also has the courage to see the world as it should be.
Ben Gurion once said , In Israel , in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.
Sometimes , the greatest miracle is recognizing that the world can change.
That is a lesson that the world has learned from the Jewish people.
And that brings me to the final area that I will focus on prosperity , and Israel s broader role in the world.
I know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headlines , but that is not where people live.
And every day , even amidst the threats that you face , Israelis are defining themselves by the opportunities that you are creating.
Through talent and hard work , Israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy.
Israelis understand the value of education and have produced 10 Nobel laureates.
Israelis understand the power of invention , and your universities educate engineers and inventors.
And that spirit has led to economic growth and human progress solar power and electric cars , bandages and prosthetic limbs that save lives , stem cell research and new drugs that treat disease , cell phones and computer technology that changed the way people around the world live.
So if people want to see the future of the world economy , they should look at Tel Aviv , home to hundreds of start ups and research centers.
Israelis are so active on social media that every day seemed to bring a different Facebook campaign about where I should give this speech.
That innovation is just as important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as our security cooperation.
Our first free trade agreement in the world was reached with Israel , nearly three decades ago.
Today the trade between our two countries is at 40 billion every year.
More importantly , that partnership is creating new products and medical treatments it is pushing new frontiers of science and exploration.
That is the kind of relationship that Israel should have and could have with every country in the world.
Already , we see how that innovation could reshape this region.
There is a program here in Jerusalem that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to learn vital skills in technology and business.
An Israeli and Palestinian have started a venture capital fund to finance Palestinian start ups.
Over 100 high tech companies have found a home on the West Bank which speaks to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the Palestinian people.
One of the great ironies of what is happening in the broader region is that so much of what people are yearning for education , entrepreneurship , the ability to start a business without paying a bribe , the ability to connect to the global economy those are things that can be found here in Israel.
This should be a hub for thriving regional trade , and an engine for opportunity.
Israel is already a center for innovation that helps power the global economy.
And I believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhanced with greater security , enhanced with lasting peace.
Here , in this small strip of land that has been the center of so much of the world s history , so much triumph and so much tragedy , Israelis have built something that few could have imagined 65 years ago.
Tomorrow , I will pay tribute to that history at the grave of Herzl , a man who had the foresight to see the future of the Jewish people had to be reconnected to their past at the grave of Rabin , who understood that Israel s victories in war had to be followed by the battles for peace at Yad Vashem , where the world is reminded of the cloud of evil that can descend on the Jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant.
We bear all that history on our shoulders.
We carry all that history in our hearts.
Today , as we face the twilight of Israel s founding generation , you the young people of Israel must now claim its future.
It falls to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation.
And as the President of a country that you can count on as your greatest friend I am confident that you can help us find the promise in the days that lie ahead.
And as a man who is been inspired in my own life by that timeless calling within the Jewish experience tikkun olam I am hopeful that we can draw upon what is best in ourselves to meet the challenges that will come to win the battles for peace in the wake of so much war and to do the work of repairing this world.
That is your job.
That is my job.
That is the task of all of us.
May God bless you.
May God bless Israel.
May God bless the United States of America.
Toda raba.
Thank you.
.
I wanted to come out here , first of all , to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session.
The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks , there is going to obviously be a whole range of issues immigration , economics , et cetera we will try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions.
The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions , but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling.
I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday.
But watching the debate over the course of the last week , I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit.
First of all , I want to make sure that , once again , I send my thoughts and prayers , as well as Michelle s , to the family of Trayvon Martin , and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they have dealt with the entire situation.
I can only imagine what they are going through , and it is remarkable how they have handled it.
The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday , which is there is going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case I will let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues.
The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner.
The prosecution and the defense made their arguments.
The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant , and they rendered a verdict.
And once the jury has spoken , that is how our system works.
But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling.
You know , when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son.
Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.
And when you think about why , in the African American community at least , there is a lot of pain around what happened here , I think it is important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does not go away.
There are very few African American men in this country who have not had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store.
That includes me.
There are very few African American men who have not had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.
That happens to me at least before I was a senator.
There are very few African Americans who have not had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.
That happens often.
And I do not want to exaggerate this , but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.
And it is inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.
The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws.
And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case.
Now , this is not to say that the African American community is na iuml ve about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.
It is not to make excuses for that fact although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context.
They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country , and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.
And so the fact that sometimes that is unacknowledged adds to the frustration.
And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given , well , there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain.
I think the African American community is also not na iuml ve in understanding that , statistically , somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.
So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys.
But they get frustrated , I think , if they feel that there is no context for it and that context is being denied.
And that all contributes I think to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario , that , from top to bottom , both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.
Now , the question for me at least , and I think for a lot of folks , is where do we take this How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction I think it is understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests , and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through , as long as it remains nonviolent.
If I see any violence , then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.
But beyond protests or vigils , the question is , are there some concrete things that we might be able to do.
I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there , but I think it is important for people to have some clear expectations here.
Traditionally , these are issues of state and local government , the criminal code.
And law enforcement is traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal levels.
That does not mean , though , that as a nation we cannot do some things that I think would be productive.
So let me just give a couple of specifics that I am still bouncing around with my staff , so we are not rolling out some five point plan , but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus.
Number one , precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level , I think it would be productive for the Justice Department , governors , mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.
When I was in Illinois , I passed racial profiling legislation , and it actually did just two simple things.
One , it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped.
But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing.
And initially , the police departments across the state were resistant , but actually they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair , straightforward way that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and , in turn , be more helpful in applying the law.
And obviously , law enforcement has got a very tough job.
So that is one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if state and local governments are receptive.
And I think a lot of them would be.
And let us figure out are there ways for us to push out that kind of training.
Along the same lines , I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case , rather than diffuse potential altercations.
I know that there is been commentary about the fact that the stand your ground laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case.
On the other hand , if we are sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there is a way for them to exit from a situation , is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we had like to see And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these stand your ground laws , I had just ask people to consider , if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed , could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous , then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws.
Number three and this is a long term project we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys.
And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about.
There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.
And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them I am not na iuml ve about the prospects of some grand , new federal program.
I am not sure that that is what we are talking about here.
But I do recognize that as President , I have got some convening power , and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front.
And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes , and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they are a full part of this society and that they have got pathways and avenues to succeed I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation.
And we are going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that.
And then , finally , I think it is going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching.
There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race.
I have not seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations.
They end up being stilted and politicized , and folks are locked into the positions they already have.
On the other hand , in families and churches and workplaces , there is the possibility that people are a little bit more honest , and at least you ask yourself your own questions about , am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can Am I judging people as much as I can , based on not the color of their skin , but the content of their character That would , I think , be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.
And let me just leave you with a final thought that , as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people , I do not want us to lose sight that things are getting better.
Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race.
It does not mean we are in a post racial society.
It does not mean that racism is eliminated.
But when I talk to Malia and Sasha , and I listen to their friends and I seem them interact , they are better than we are they are better than we were on these issues.
And that is true in every community that I have visited all across the country.
And so we have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues.
And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature , as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions.
But we should also have confidence that kids these days , I think , have more sense than we did back then , and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long , difficult journey , we are becoming a more perfect union not a perfect union , but a more perfect union.
Thank you , guys.
.
My fellow Americans , tonight , I had like to talk with you about immigration.
For more than 200 years , our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations.
It is kept us youthful , dynamic , and entrepreneurial.
It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities people not trapped by our past , but able to remake ourselves as we choose.
But today , our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it.
Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules.
Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less.
All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America.
And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows , or risk their families being torn apart.
It is been this way for decades.
And for decades , we have not done much about it.
When I took office , I committed to fixing this broken immigration system.
And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders.
Today , we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history.
And over the past six years , illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half.
Although this summer , there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border , the number of such children is now actually lower than it is been in nearly two years.
Overall , the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.
Those are the facts.
Meanwhile , I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix , and last year , 68 Democrats , Republicans , and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate.
It was not perfect.
It was a compromise.
But it reflected common sense.
It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine , started paying their taxes , and went to the back of the line.
And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits.
Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes or no vote , it would have passed with support from both parties , and today it would be the law.
But for a year and a half now , Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote.
Now , I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law.
But until that happens , there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
Tonight , I am announcing those actions.
First , we will build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings , and speed the return of those who do cross over.
Second , I will make it easier and faster for high skilled immigrants , graduates , and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy , as so many business leaders have proposed.
Third , we will take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.
I want to say more about this third issue , because it generates the most passion and controversy.
Even as we are a nation of immigrants , we are also a nation of laws.
Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws , and I believe that they must be held accountable especially those who may be dangerous.
That is why , over the past six years , deportations of criminals are up 80 percent.
And that is why we are going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security.
Felons , not families.
Criminals , not children.
Gang members , not a mom who is working hard to provide for her kids.
We will prioritize , just like law enforcement does every day.
But even as we focus on deporting criminals , the fact is , millions of immigrants in every state , of every race and nationality still live here illegally.
And let us be honest tracking down , rounding up , and deporting millions of people is not realistic.
Anyone who suggests otherwise is not being straight with you.
It is also not who we are as Americans.
After all , most of these immigrants have been here a long time.
They work hard , often in tough , low paying jobs.
They support their families.
They worship at our churches.
Many of their kids are American born or spent most of their lives here , and their hopes , dreams , and patriotism are just like ours.
As my predecessor , President Bush , once put it They are a part of American life.
Now here s the thing We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules.
We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded.
So we are going to offer the following deal If you have been in America for more than five years if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents if you register , pass a criminal background check , and you are willing to pay your fair share of taxes you will be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation.
You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.
That is what this deal is.
Now , let us be clear about what it is not.
This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently.
It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future.
It does not grant citizenship , or the right to stay here permanently , or offer the same benefits that citizens receive only Congress can do that.
All we are saying is we are not going to deport you.
I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty.
Well , it is not.
Amnesty is the immigration system we have today millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time.
That is the real amnesty leaving this broken system the way it is.
Mass amnesty would be unfair.
Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character.
What I am describing is accountability a common sense , middle ground approach If you meet the criteria , you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.
If you are a criminal , you will be deported.
If you plan to enter the illegally , your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.
The actions I am taking are not only lawful , they are the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century.
And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better , or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed , I have one answer Pass a bill.
I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution.
And the day I sign that bill into law , the actions I take will no longer be necessary.
Meanwhile , do not let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue.
That is not how our democracy works , and Congress certainly should not shut down our government again just because we disagree on this.
Americans are tired of gridlock.
What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose a higher purpose.
Most Americans support the types of reforms I have talked about tonight.
But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home.
Millions of us , myself included , go back generations in this country , with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens.
So we do not like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship.
I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are , or take our jobs , or stick it to middle class families at a time when they already feel like they have gotten the raw deal for over a decade.
I hear these concerns.
But that is not what these steps would do.
Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society.
And I believe it is important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other s character.
Because for all the back and forth of Washington , we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger.
It is about who we are as a country , and who we want to be for future generations.
Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends , take responsibility , and give their kids a better future Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents arms Or are we a nation that values families , and works together to keep them together Are we a nation that educates the world s best and brightest in our universities , only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here , create businesses here , create industries right here in America That is what this debate is all about.
We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration.
We need reasoned , thoughtful , compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes , not our fears.
I know the politics of this issue are tough.
But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it.
Over the past few years , I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government , and at risk any moment of losing it all , just to build a better life for their kids.
I have seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they did not have the right papers.
I have seen the courage of students who , except for the circumstances of their birth , are as American as Malia or Sasha students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love.
These people our neighbors , our classmates , our friends they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life.
They came to work , and study , and serve in our military , and above all , contribute to America s success.
Tomorrow , I will travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students , including a young woman named Astrid Silva.
Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old.
Her only possessions were a cross , her doll , and the frilly dress she had on.
When she started school , she did not speak any English.
She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBand she became a good student.
Her father worked in landscaping.
Her mom cleaned other people s homes.
They would not let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school , not because they did not love her , but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant so she applied behind their back and got in.
Still , she mostly lived in the shadows until her grandmother , who visited every year from Mexico , passed away , and she could not travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported.
It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her , and today , Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree.
Are we a nation that kicks out a striving , hopeful immigrant like Astrid , or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger , for we know the heart of a stranger we were strangers once , too.
My fellow Americans , we are and always will be a nation of immigrants.
We were strangers once , too.
And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic , or the Pacific , or the Rio Grande , we are here only because this country welcomed them in , and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like , or what our last names are , or how we worship.
What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal , and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.
That is the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us.
That is the tradition we must uphold.
That is the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come.
Thank you.
God bless you.
And God bless this country we love.
.
Well , you know I love you back.
It is a rare honor in this life to follow one of your heroes.
And John Lewis is one of my heroes.
Now , I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown Chapel , heroics were not on his mind.
A day like this was not on his mind.
Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were milling about.
Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics of non violence the right way to protect yourself when attacked.
A doctor described what tear gas does to the body , while marchers scribbled down instructions for contacting their loved ones.
The air was thick with doubt , anticipation and fear.
And they comforted themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sung No matter what may be the test , God will take care of you Lean , weary one , upon His breast , God will take care of you.
And then , his knapsack stocked with an apple , a toothbrush , and a book on government all you need for a night behind bars John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to change America.
President and Bush , Governor Bentley , Mayor Evans , Sewell , Reverend Strong , members of Congress , elected officials , foot soldiers , friends , fellow Americans As John noted , there are places and moments in America where this nation s destiny has been decided.
Many are sites of war Concord and Lexington , Appomattox , Gettysburg.
Others are sites that symbolize the daring of America s character Independence Hall and Seneca Falls , Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral.
Selma is such a place.
In one afternoon 50 years ago , so much of our turbulent history the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow the death of four little girls in Birmingham and the dream of a Baptist preacher all that history met on this bridge.
It was not a clash of armies , but a clash of wills a contest to determine the true meaning of America.
And because of men and women like John Lewis , Joseph Lowery , Hosea Williams , Amelia Boynton , Diane Nash , Ralph Abernathy , Vivian , Andrew Young , Fred Shuttlesworth , Martin Luther King , , and so many others , the idea of a just America and a fair America , an inclusive America , and a generous America that idea ultimately triumphed.
As is true across the landscape of American history , we cannot examine this moment in isolation.
The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes.
We gather here to celebrate them.
We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod tear gas and the trampling hoof men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching towards justice.
They did as Scripture instructed Rejoice in hope , be patient in tribulation , be constant in prayer.
And in the days to come , they went back again and again.
When the trumpet call sounded for more to join , the people came black and white , young and old , Christian and Jew , waving the American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and hope.
A white newsman , Bill Plante , who covered the marches then and who is with us here today , quipped that the growing number of white people lowered the quality of the singing.
To those who marched , though , those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweet.
In time , their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson.
And he would send them protection , and speak to the nation , echoing their call for America and the world to hear We shall overcome.
What enormous faith these men and women had.
Faith in God , but also faith in America.
The Americans who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing.
But they gave courage to millions.
They held no elected office.
But they led a nation.
They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence , countless daily indignities but they did not seek special treatment , just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before.
What they did here will reverberate through the ages.
Not because the change they won was preordained not because their victory was complete but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible , that love and hope can conquer hate.
As we commemorate their achievement , we are well served to remember that at the time of the marches , many in power condemned rather than praised them.
Back then , they were called Communists , or half breeds , or outside agitators , sexual and moral degenerates , and worse they were called everything but the name their parents gave them.
Their faith was questioned.
Their lives were threatened.
Their patriotism challenged.
And yet , what could be more American than what happened in this place What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people unsung , the downtrodden , the dreamers not of high station , not born to wealth or privilege , not of one religious tradition but many , coming together to shape their country s course What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this , what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished , that we are strong enough to be self critical , that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals That is why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience.
That is why it is not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance.
It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents We the People hellip in order to form a more perfect union.
We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal.
These are not just words.
They are a living thing , a call to action , a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny.
For founders like Franklin and Jefferson , for leaders like Lincoln and FDthe success of our experiment in self government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work.
And that is what we celebrate here in Selma.
That is what this movement was all about , one leg in our long journey toward freedom.
The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge , that is the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny.
It is the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot , workers to organize against an unjust status quo the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon.
It is the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths.
It requires the occasional disruption , the willingness to speak out for what is right , to shake up the status quo.
That is America.
That is what makes us unique.
That is what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity.
Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall.
Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid.
Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule.
They saw what John Lewis had done.
From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine , this generation of young people can draw strength from this place , where the powerless could change the world s greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom.
They saw that idea made real right here in Selma , Alabama.
They saw that idea manifest itself here in America.
Because of campaigns like this , a Voting Rights Act was passed.
Political and economic and social barriers came down.
And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms , who sit on the bench , who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office.
Because of what they did , the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks , but for every American.
Women marched through those doors.
Latinos marched through those doors.
Asian Americans , gay Americans , Americans with disabilities they all came through those doors.
Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again , not by reasserting the past , but by transcending the past.
What a glorious thing , King might say.
And what a solemn debt we owe.
Which leads us to ask , just how might we repay that debt First and foremost , we have to recognize that one day s commemoration , no matter how special , is not enough.
If Selma taught us anything , it is that our work is never done.
The American experiment in self government gives work and purpose to each generation.
Selma teaches us , as well , that action requires that we shed our cynicism.
For when it comes to the pursuit of justice , we can afford neither complacency nor despair.
Just this week , I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justice s Ferguson report shows that , with respect to race , little has changed in this country.
And I understood the question the report s narrative was sadly familiar.
It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement.
But I rejected the notion that nothing s changed.
What happened in Ferguson may not be unique , but it is no longer endemic.
It is no longer sanctioned by law or by custom.
And before the Civil Rights Movement , it most surely was.
We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable , that racial division is inherent to America.
If you think nothing s changed in the past 50 years , ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s.
Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing s changed.
Ask your gay friend if it is easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago.
To deny this progress , this hard won progress our progress would be to rob us of our own agency , our own capacity , our responsibility to do what we can to make America better.
Of course , a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident that racism is banished that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete , and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the race card for their own purposes.
We do not need the Ferguson report to know that is not true.
We just need to open our eyes , and our ears , and our hearts to know that this nation s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us.
We know the march is not yet over.
We know the race is not yet won.
We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged , all of us , by the content of our character requires admitting as much , facing up to the truth.
We are capable of bearing a great burden , James Baldwin once wrote , once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.
There is nothing America cannot handle if we actually look squarely at the problem.
And this is work for all Americans , not just some.
Not just whites.
Not just blacks.
If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day , then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination.
All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now.
All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions , on our attitudes , the things we teach our children.
And if we make such an effort , no matter how hard it may sometimes seem , laws can be passed , and consciences can be stirred , and consensus can be built.
With such an effort , we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some.
Together , we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect , and citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland , they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago the protection of the law.
Together , we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons , and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men , and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads , and good workers , and good neighbors.
With effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity.
Americans do not accept a free ride for anybody , nor do we believe in equality of outcomes.
But we do expect equal opportunity.
And if we really mean it , if we are not just giving lip service to it , but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it , then , yes , we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century , one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need.
We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job , and a fair wage , and a real voice , and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle class.
And with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge and that is the right to vote.
Right now , in 2015 , 50 years after Selma , there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote.
As we speak , more of such laws are being proposed.
Meanwhile , the Voting Rights Act , the culmination of so much blood , so much sweat and tears , the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence , the Voting Rights Act stands weakened , its future subject to political rancor.
How can that be The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy , the result of Republican and Democratic efforts.
President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office.
President George Bush signed its renewal when he was in office.
One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it.
If we want to honor this day , let that hundred go back to Washington and gather four hundred more , and together , pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year.
That is how we honor those on this bridge.
Of course , our democracy is not the task of Congress alone , or the courts alone , or even the President alone.
If every new voter suppression law was struck down today , we would still have , here in America , one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples.
Fifty years ago , registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar , the number of bubbles on a bar of soap.
It meant risking your dignity , and sometimes , your life.
What is our excuse today for not voting How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought How do we so fully give away our power , our voice , in shaping America s future Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places We give away our power.
Fellow marchers , so much has changed in 50 years.
We have endured war and we have fashioned peace.
We have seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives.
We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have scarcely imagined.
But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship that willingness of a 26 year old deacon , or a Unitarian minister , or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that they had risk everything to realize its promise.
That is what it means to love America.
That is what it means to believe in America.
That is what it means when we say America is exceptional.
For we were born of change.
We broke the old aristocracies , declaring ourselves entitled not by bloodline , but endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.
We secure our rights and responsibilities through a system of self government , of and by and for the people.
That is why we argue and fight with so much passion and conviction because we know our efforts matter.
We know America is what we make of it.
Look at our history.
We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea , pioneers who braved the unfamiliar , followed by a stampede of farmers and miners , and entrepreneurs and hucksters.
That is our spirit.
That is who we are.
We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer , women who could do as much as any man and then some.
And we are Susan Anthony , who shook the system until the law reflected that truth.
That is our character.
We are the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores , the huddled masses yearning to breathe free Holocaust survivors , Soviet defectors , the Lost Boys of Sudan.
We are the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande because we want our kids to know a better life.
That is how we came to be.
We are the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South.
We are the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up the West , and countless laborers who laid rail , and raised skyscrapers , and organized for workers rights.
We are the fresh faced GIs who fought to liberate a continent.
And we are the Tuskeegee Airmen , and the Navajo code talkers , and the Japanese Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied.
We are the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on 9 11 , the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq.
We are the gay Americans whose blood ran in the streets of San Francisco and New York , just as blood ran down this bridge.
We are storytellers , writers , poets , artists who abhor unfairness , and despise hypocrisy , and give voice to the voiceless , and tell truths that need to be told.
We are the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues , bluegrass and country , and hip hop and rock and roll , and our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom.
We are Jackie Robinson , enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head , and stealing home in the World Series anyway.
We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who build our temples for tomorrow , strong as we know how.
We are the people Emerson wrote of , who for truth and honor s sake stand fast and suffer long who are never tired , so long as we can see far enough.
That is what America is.
Not stock photos or airbrushed history , or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others.
We respect the past , but we do not pine for the past.
We do not fear the future we grab for it.
America is not some fragile thing.
We are large , in the words of Whitman , containing multitudes.
We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy , perpetually young in spirit.
That is why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 could lead a mighty march.
And that is what the young people here today and listening all across the country must take away from this day.
You are America.
Unconstrained by habit and convention.
Unencumbered by what is , because you are ready to seize what ought to be.
For everywhere in this country , there are first steps to be taken , there is new ground to cover , there are more bridges to be crossed.
And it is you , the young and fearless at heart , the most diverse and educated generation in our history , who the nation is waiting to follow.
Because Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person.
Because the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word We.
We The People.
We Shall Overcome.
Yes We Can.
That word is owned by no one.
It belongs to everyone.
Oh , what a glorious task we are given , to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.
Fifty years from Bloody Sunday , our march is not yet finished , but we are getting closer.
Two hundred and thirty nine years after this nation s founding our union is not yet perfect , but we are getting closer.
Our job s easier because somebody already got us through that first mile.
Somebody already got us over that bridge.
When it feels the road is too hard , when the torch we have been passed feels too heavy , we will remember these early travelers , and draw strength from their example , and hold firmly the words of the prophet Isaiah Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
They will soar on wings like eagles.
They will run and not grow weary.
They will walk and not be faint.
We honor those who walked so we could run.
We must run so our children soar.
And we will not grow weary.
For we believe in the power of an awesome God , and we believe in this country s sacred promise.
May He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us , and bless the United States of America.
Thank you , everybody.
.
Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans Tonight marks the eighth year that I have come here to report on the State of the Union.
And for this final one , I am going to try to make it a little shorter.
I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.
I have been there.
I will be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.
And I understand that because it is an election season , expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.
But , Speaker , I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.
So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse.
So , who knows , we might surprise the cynics again.
But tonight , I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead.
Do not worry , I have got plenty , from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.
And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done.
Fixing a broken immigration system.
Protecting our kids from gun violence.
Equal pay for equal work.
Paid leave.
Raising the minimum wage.
All these things still matter to hardworking families.
They are still the right thing to do.
And I will not let up until they get done.
But for my final address to this chamber , I do not want to just talk about next year.
I want to focus on the next five years , the next 10 years , and beyond.
I want to focus on our future.
We live in a time of extraordinary change change that is reshaping the way we live , the way we work , our planet , our place in the world.
It is change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs , but also economic disruptions that strain working families.
It promises education for girls in the most remote villages , but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.
It is change that can broaden opportunity , or widen inequality.
And whether we like it or not , the pace of this change will only accelerate.
America has been through big changes before wars and depression , the influx of new immigrants , workers fighting for a fair deal , movements to expand civil rights.
Each time , there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.
And each time , we overcame those fears.
We did not , in the words of Lincoln , adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past.
Instead we thought anew , and acted anew.
We made change work for us , always extending America s promise outward , to the next frontier , to more people.
And because we did because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril we emerged stronger and better than before.
What was true then can be true now.
Our unique strengths as a nation our optimism and work ethic , our spirit of discovery , our diversity , our commitment to rule of law these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.
In fact , it is that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.
It is how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.
It is how we reformed our health care system , and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans , and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.
But such progress is not inevitable.
It is the result of choices we make together.
And we face such choices right now.
Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear , turning inward as a nation , turning against each other as a people Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are , in what we stand for , in the incredible things that we can do together So let us talk about the future , and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next President is , or who controls the next Congress.
First , how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy Second , how do we make technology work for us , and not against us especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change Third , how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman And finally , how can we make our politics reflect what is best in us , and not what is worst Let me start with the economy , and a basic fact The United States of America , right now , has the strongest , most durable economy in the world.
We are in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history.
More than 14 million new jobs , the strongest two years of job growth since the 90s , an unemployment rate cut in half.
Our auto industry just had its best year ever.
That is just part of a manufacturing surge that is created nearly 900 , 000 new jobs in the past six years.
And we have done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three quarters.
Anyone claiming that America s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.
Now , what is true and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious is that the economy has been changing in profound ways , changes that started long before the Great Recession hit changes that have not let up.
Today , technology does not just replace jobs on the assembly line , but any job where work can be automated.
Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere , and they face tougher competition.
As a result , workers have less leverage for a raise.
Companies have less loyalty to their communities.
And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.
All these trends have squeezed workers , even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing.
It is made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty , harder for young people to start their careers , tougher for workers to retire when they want to.
And although none of these trends are unique to America , they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.
For the past seven years , our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody.
We have made progress.
But we need to make more.
And despite all the political arguments that we have had these past few years , there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.
We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good paying job.
The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start , and together , we have increased early childhood education , lifted high school graduation rates to new highs , boosted graduates in fields like engineering.
In the coming years , we should build on that progress , by providing Pre K for all and offering every student the hands on computer science and math classes that make them job ready on day one.
We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.
And we have to make college affordable for every American.
No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.
We have already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower s income.
And that is good.
But now , we have actually got to cut the cost of college.
Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that , and I am going to keep fighting to get that started this year.
It is the right thing to do.
But a great education is not all we need in this new economy.
We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.
It is not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job , in the same place , with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber.
For everyone else , especially folks in their 40s and 50s , saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.
Americans understand that at some point in their careers , in this new economy , they may have to retool and they may have to retrain.
But they should not lose what they have already worked so hard to build in the process.
That is why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever.
We should not weaken them we should strengthen them.
And for Americans short of retirement , basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.
That , by the way , is what the Affordable Care Act is all about.
It is about filling the gaps in employer based care so that when you lose a job , or you go back to school , or you strike out and launch that new business , you will still have coverage.
Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far.
And in the process , health care inflation has slowed.
And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
Now , I am guessing we will not agree on health care anytime soon.
A little applause right there.
Just a guess.
But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security.
Say a hardworking American loses his job we should not just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that is ready to hire him.
If that new job does not pay as much , there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.
And even if he is going from job to job , he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.
That is the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.
I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.
America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance , a hand up.
And I had welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support , like expanding tax cuts for low income workers who do not have children.
But there are some areas where we just have to be honest it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years.
And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.
And it is an honest disagreement , and the American people have a choice to make.
I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.
I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed.
There is red tape that needs to be cut.
There you go Yes But after years now of record corporate profits , working families will not get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else s expense.
Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.
Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on Wall Street did.
Immigrants are not the principal reason wages have not gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long term returns.
It is sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.
The point is , I believe that in this new economy , workers and start ups and small businesses need more of a voice , not less.
The rules should work for them.
And I am not alone in this.
This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders.
And I want to spread those best practices across America.
That is part of a brighter future.
In fact , it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.
And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges Sixty years ago , when the Russians beat us into space , we did not deny Sputnik was up there.
We did not argue about the science , or shrink our research and development budget.
We built a space program almost overnight.
And 12 years later , we were walking on the moon.
Now , that spirit of discovery is in our DNAmerica is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.
America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.
America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley , racing to shape a better world.
That is who we are.
And over the past seven years , we have nurtured that spirit.
We have protected an open Internet , and taken bold new steps to get more students and low income Americans online.
We have launched next generation manufacturing hubs , and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.
But we can do so much more.
Last year , Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot , America can cure cancer.
Last month , he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they have had in over a decade.
So tonight , I am announcing a new national effort to get it done.
And because he is gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years , I am putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.
For the loved ones we have all lost , for the families that we can still save , let us make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.
Medical research is critical.
We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.
Look , if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change , have at it.
You will be pretty lonely , because you will be debating our military , most of America s business leaders , the majority of the American people , almost the entire scientific community , and 200 nations around the world who agree it is a problem and intend to solve it.
But even if even if the planet was not at stake , even if 2014 was not the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future Listen , seven years ago , we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.
Here are the results.
In fields from Iowa to Texas , wind power is now cheaper than dirtier , conventional power.
On rooftops from Arizona to New York , solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills , and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average.
We are taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy something , by the way , that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.
And meanwhile , we have cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent , and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.
Gas under two bucks a gallon am not bad , either.
Now we have got to accelerate the transition away from old , dirtier energy sources.
Rather than subsidize the past , we should invest in the future especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.
We do them no favor when we do not show them where the trends are going.
That is why I am going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources , so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.
And that way , we put money back into those communities , and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.
Now , none of this is going to happen overnight.
And , yes , there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.
But the jobs we will create , the money we will save , the planet we will preserve that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve.
And it is within our grasp.
Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world.
And that is why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation build everywhere there is a problem.
I told you earlier all the talk of America s economic decline is political hot air.
Well , so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.
Let me tell you something.
The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.
Period.
Period.
It is not even close.
It is not even close.
It is not even close.
We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.
Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.
No nation attacks us directly , or our allies , because they know that is the path to ruin.
Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office , and when it comes to every important international issue , people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead they call us.
I mean , it is useful to level the set here , because when we do not , we do not make good decisions.
Now , as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing , I know this is a dangerous time.
But that is not primarily because of some looming superpower out there , and certainly not because of diminished American strength.
In today s world , we are threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.
The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation , rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.
Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition.
Even as their economy severely contracts , Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit.
And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.
It is up to us , the United States of America , to help remake that system.
And to do that well it means that we have got to set priorities.
Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.
Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people , because in today s world , even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life , including their own , can do a lot of damage.
They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country.
Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies.
We have to take them out.
But as we focus on destroying ISIover the top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.
Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks , twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped.
But they do not threaten our national existence.
That is the story ISIL wants to tell.
That is the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.
We do not need to build them up to show that we are serious , and we sure do not need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world s largest religions.
We just need to call them what they are killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out , hunted down , and destroyed.
And that is exactly what we are doing.
For more than a year , America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL s financing , disrupt their plots , stop the flow of terrorist fighters , and stamp out their vicious ideology.
With nearly 10 , 000 air strikes , we are taking out their leadership , their oil , their training camps , their weapons.
We are training , arming , and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.
If this Congress is serious about winning this war , and wants to send a message to our troops and the world , authorize the use of military force against ISITake a vote.
Take a vote.
But the American people should know that with or without congressional action , ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.
If you doubt America s commitment or mine to see that justice is done , just ask Osama bin Laden.
Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen , who was taken out last year , or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks , who sits in a prison cell.
When you come after Americans , we go after you.
And it may take time , but we have long memories , and our reach has no limits.
Our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda , but it cannot stop there.
For even without ISIeven without al Qaeda , instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world in the Middle East , in Afghanistan , parts of Pakistan , in parts of Central America , in Africa , and Asia.
Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.
Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict , or famine , feeding the next wave of refugees.
The world will look to us to help solve these problems , and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.
That may work as a TV sound bite , but it does not pass muster on the world stage.
We also cannot try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis , even if it is done with the best of intentions.
That is not leadership that is a recipe for quagmire , spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us.
It is the lesson of Vietnam it is the lesson of Iraq and we should have learned it by now.
Fortunately , there is a smarter approach , a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.
It says America will always act , alone if necessary , to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern , we will mobilize the world to work with us , and make sure other countries pull their own weight.
That is our approach to conflicts like Syria , where we are partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.
That is why we built a global coalition , with sanctions and principled diplomacy , to prevent a nuclear armed Iran.
And as we speak , Iran has rolled back its nuclear program , shipped out its uranium stockpile , and the world has avoided another war.
That is how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.
Our military , our doctors , our development workers they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic.
Hundreds of thousands , maybe a couple million lives were saved.
That is how we forged a Trans Pacific Partnership to open markets , and protect workers and the environment , and advance American leadership in Asia.
It cuts 18 , 000 taxes on products made in America , which will then support more good jobs here in America.
With TPChina does not set the rules in that region we do.
You want to show our strength in this new century Approve this agreement.
Give us the tools to enforce it.
It is the right thing to do.
Let me give you another example.
Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy , and set us back in Latin America.
That is why we restored diplomatic relations opened the door to travel and commerce , positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.
So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere , recognize that the Cold War is over lift the embargo.
The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world except when we kill terrorists or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.
Leadership means a wise application of military power , and rallying the world behind causes that are right.
It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security , not something separate , not charity.
When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change , yes , that helps vulnerable countries , but it also protects our kids.
When we help Ukraine defend its democracy , or Colombia resolve a decades long war , that strengthens the international order we depend on.
When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick it is the right thing to do , and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.
Right now , we are on track to end the scourge of HIV AIDThat is within our grasp.
And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something I will be pushing this Congress to fund this year.
That is American strength.
That is American leadership.
And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.
That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.
It is expensive , it is unnecessary , and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.
There is a better way.
And that is why we need to reject any politics any politics that targets people because of race or religion.
Let me just say this.
This is not a matter of political correctness.
This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong.
The world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity , and our openness , and the way we respect every faith.
His Holiness , Pope Francis , told this body from the very spot that I am standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.
When politicians insult Muslims , whether abroad or our fellow citizens , when a mosque is vandalized , or a kid is called names , that does not make us safer.
That is not telling it like it is.
It is just wrong.
It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.
It makes it harder to achieve our goals.
It betrays who we are as a country.
We the People.
Our Constitution begins with those three simple words , words we have come to recognize mean all the people , not just some words that insist we rise and fall together , and that is how we might perfect our Union.
And that brings me to the fourth , and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight.
The future we want all of us want opportunity and security for our families , a rising standard of living , a sustainable , peaceful planet for our kids all that is within our reach.
But it will only happen if we work together.
It will only happen if we can have rational , constructive debates.
It will only happen if we fix our politics.
A better politics does not mean we have to agree on everything.
This is a big country different regions , different attitudes , different interests.
That is one of our strengths , too.
Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government , and expected us to argue , just as they did , fiercely , over the size and shape of government , over commerce and foreign relations , over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.
But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.
It does not work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice.
It does not work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise , or when even basic facts are contested , or when we listen only to those who agree with us.
Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention.
And most of all , democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice does not matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.
Too many Americans feel that way right now.
It is one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.
I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide , and I guarantee I will keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.
But , my fellow Americans , this cannot be my task or any President s alone.
There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber , good people who would like to see more cooperation , would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington , but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected , by the noise coming out of your base.
I know you have told me.
It is the worst kept secret in Washington.
And a lot of you are not enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.
But that means if we want a better politics and I am addressing the American people now if we want a better politics , it is not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President.
We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.
I think we have got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters , and not the other way around.
Let a bipartisan group do it.
We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics , so that a handful of families or hidden interests cannot bankroll our elections.
And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cannot pass muster in the courts , we need to work together to find a real solution because it is a problem.
And most of you do not like raising money.
I know I have done it.
We have got to make it easier to vote , not harder.
We need to modernize it for the way we live now.
This is America We want to make it easier for people to participate.
And over the course of this year , I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.
But I cannot do these things on my own.
Changes in our political process in not just who gets elected , but how they get elected that will only happen when the American people demand it.
It depends on you.
That is what is meant by a government of , by , and for the people.
What I am suggesting is hard.
It is a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible , and politics is hopeless , and the problem is all the folks who are elected do not care , and to believe that our voices and actions do not matter.
But if we give up now , then we forsake a better future.
Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war , or allow another economic disaster , or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought , even died , to secure.
And then , as frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who do not look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background.
We cannot afford to go down that path.
It will not deliver the economy we want.
It will not produce the security we want.
But most of all , it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.
So , my fellow Americans , whatever you may believe , whether you prefer one party or no party , whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen.
To vote.
To speak out.
To stand up for others , especially the weak , especially the vulnerable , knowing that each of us is only here because somebody , somewhere , stood up for us.
We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.
It is not easy.
Our brand of democracy is hard.
But I can promise that a little over a year from now , when I no longer hold this office , I will be right there with you as a citizen , inspired by those voices of fairness and vision , of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far.
Voices that help us see ourselves not , first and foremost , as black or white , or Asian or Latino , not as gay or straight , immigrant or native born , not as Democrat or Republican , but as Americans first , bound by a common creed.
Voices King believed would have the final word voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.
And they are out there , those voices.
They do not get a lot of attention they do not seek a lot of fanfare but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.
I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours.
I see you , the American people.
And in your daily acts of citizenship , I see our future unfolding.
I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open , and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.
I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project , and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.
I see it in the American who served his time , and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance.
The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat , treating everybody with respect , doing the brave , quiet work of keeping us safe.
I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers , the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon , the community that lines up to cheer him on.
It is the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is , and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he is been taught.
I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.
That is the America I know.
That is the country we love.
Clear eyed.
Big hearted.
Undaunted by challenge.
Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
That is what makes me so hopeful about our future.
I believe in change because I believe in you , the American people.
And that is why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong.
Thank you , God bless you.
God bless the United States of America.
