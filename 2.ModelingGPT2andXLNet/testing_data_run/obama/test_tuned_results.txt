There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty.|One way would be to say , well , you know what , we will just go back to what we were doing before on , let us say , the financial markets.|One is that we have been moving to remove the term "terrible" from the language.
One way would be to say , well , you know what , we will just go back to what we were doing before on , let us say , the financial markets.|We will not have the regulations that we need we will not make any changes in terms of too big to fail.|Well, I think the problem with some of these cases is just, well, what they have come up with that has been pretty surprising to me, particularly at a time when it comes to rates of unemployment being higher than we thought possible in most places.
We will not have the regulations that we need we will not make any changes in terms of too big to fail.|That will provide certainty until the next financial crisis.|We will not have the regulations that we need we will not make any changes in terms of too big to fail.
That will provide certainty until the next financial crisis.|That is not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need.|And it will provide certainty until the next financial crisis.
That is not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need.|The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets so that we do not have banks that are too big to fail that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts.|So let me ask you this.
The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets so that we do not have banks that are too big to fail that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts.|That requires legislation.|And that is going to take some back, so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts.
That requires legislation.|The sooner we can get that done , the better.|But if the law requires legislation, then it does not require us to follow the amicus brief of many who have argued the case.
The sooner we can get that done , the better.|The same would be true when it comes to health care.|Finally, I don't think it is fair to ask Republicans to turn around and offer us another term to fix something that we just had done a year ago.
The same would be true when it comes to health care.|A lot of CEOs I hear from will say , boy , we had like you to get health care settled one way or another , but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent , that is the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment.|We need to act on a national level to transform this through innovative new research that will allow us to save millions of lives.

So I guess my answer would be this The sooner the business community has a sense that we have got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big , serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling , I think the better off the entire country is going to be.|I absolutely agree on that.|The sooner the business community has a sense that we have got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be.
I absolutely agree on that.|What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform , for example , to say , boy , we had be doing fine if we just did not try to regulate the banks.|And let me go back to the point at the outset.
What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform , for example , to say , boy , we had be doing fine if we just did not try to regulate the banks.|That I think would be a mistake.|That is something we can do, because there is no question that we should.
That I think would be a mistake.|The small businesses I talk to and I have been talking to a lot of them as I have been traveling around the country over the last several months their biggest problem is right now they cannot get credit out of their banks so they are uncertain about that.|CLINTON: But if it is the right thing to do, to make health care more affordable to millions of Americans and make college tuition affordable, it is also the right thing to do.
The small businesses I talk to and I have been talking to a lot of them as I have been traveling around the country over the last several months their biggest problem is right now they cannot get credit out of their banks so they are uncertain about that.|And they are still uncertain about orders do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more.|They have not really understood how they can create jobs.
And they are still uncertain about orders do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more.|It is looking better at this point.|They are still uncertain about orders do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more.
It is looking better at this point.|But that is not the rationale for people saying , I am not hiring.|Let us be clear about it.
But that is not the rationale for people saying , I am not hiring.|Let me put it this way.|That is not the rationale for people saying, I am not hiring.
Let me put it this way.|Most small businesses right now , if they have got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll , boost their inventory , and sell to those customers , they will do so.|President Franklin Roosevelt once said we were in a dictatorship.
Most small businesses right now , if they have got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll , boost their inventory , and sell to those customers , they will do so.|Okay Let us see , let us get a print guy here.|Small businesses right now, if they have got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll, boost their inventory, and sell to those customers, they will do so.
Okay Let us see , let us get a print guy here.|David.|Let us see, let us get a print guy here.

You know , I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach.|What do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy.|That said, I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach.
What do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy.|So we have to move in that direction.|Do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy.
So we have to move in that direction.|What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth , produce jobs , make sure our businesses are competitive around the world , that we are going to need some of the old , traditional energy sources as we are developing these new ones and ramping them up.|.
What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth , produce jobs , make sure our businesses are competitive around the world , that we are going to need some of the old , traditional energy sources as we are developing these new ones and ramping them up.|So we cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy.|And so, as the first energy policymaker to speak out against the Keystone XL pipeline, and an industry livid about the prospect of near mandatory fracking in the United States, I agree that it is important to put more Americans on the front end of this transition in order to spur a new energy generation strategy that can promote job growth and help reduce the cost of fossil fuels.
So we cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy.|That just cannot happen.|We cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy.
That just cannot happen.|We are going to have needs in these traditional sources.|Just cannot happen.
We are going to have needs in these traditional sources.|And so the question then is , are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe , secure nuclear power that includes new technologies so that we can use coal which we have in abundance and is very cheap , but often is adding to our greenhouse gases can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy.|They are coming from anywhere.

Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix.|But we have got to do both.|But what I think I am going to see is we get to more efficient cars and freeways and more renewable energy and natural gas and all of that.

I am just a eternal optimist and so it is the right thing to do.|And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what is right for the country and assume that over time people , regardless of party , regardless of their particular political positions , are going to gravitate towards the truth.|Once you have a child, they needn't face the challenge of what are called furloughs, a medical judgment that is more intrusive and uncertain than any other.

They rejected it although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it is not always clear who is speaking on behalf of the government , and we get a lot of different , mixed signals.|But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept.|But for now, I am confident we can do a good job of building this community together and building a shared sense of responsibility between the men and women who have served here.
But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept.|That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.|So here is another question about Iran where do they stand and where are they going.
That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.|And that is not acceptable to the international community , not just to the United States.|Indeed, even as I think that their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use, that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.

So if it is established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those costs , I have said from the beginning of this debate I had be willing to work on that.|On the other hand , if I am told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs , then I am also going to insist , okay , let us look at that as one aspect of it , but what else are we willing to do And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier.|If it is established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those costs, I have said from the beginning of this debate I had be willing to work on that.

So , all right Okay , since there was not a jobs question I will make this the last one , jobs question.|Well , my understanding is first of all , the House has moved forward a jobs package that has some good elements in it.|OK, since there was not a jobs question I will make this the last one, jobs question.
Well , my understanding is first of all , the House has moved forward a jobs package that has some good elements in it.|My understanding is , is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as we speak on the Senate side about some elements of a package.|Secondly, it strengthens the National Security Agency and strengthens the so-called counterintelligence agency.
