      "###############################\n",
      "The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18 , 1874 , with the following favorable comment upon the labors of the Commission If sustained by Congress , I have no doubt the rules can , after the experience gained , be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service and relieve the Executive , members of Congress , and the heads of Departments from influences prejudicial to good administration.\n",

      "In the meantime , however , competitive examinations , under many embarrassments , have been conducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Washington and in a number of the custom houses and post offices of the principal cities of the country , with a view to further test their effects , and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the Administration of my predecessor.\n",

      "The reports of the Government officers , in the city of New York especially , bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respective offices , showing that These examinations and the excellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service , and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion.\n",

      "The examinations have been attended by many citizens , who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of determining the results , and those visitors have without exception approved the methods employed , and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion.\n",

      "Holding the opinion , which I expressed in my annual message , that neither the interests of the Government nor of the people of the United States would be promoted by disparaging silver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world , and that legislation which looks to maintaining the volume of intrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as their relative commercial values will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient , it has been my earnest desire to concur with Congress in the adoption of such measures to increase the silver coinage of the country as would not impair the obligation of contracts , either public or private , nor injuriously affect the public credit.\n",

      "###############################\n",
      "Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or in silver coin is of but little moment compared with the possible reduction of interest one third by refunding it at such reduced rate.\n",

      "###############################\n",
      "In adapting the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of currency in the everyday transactions of life and prescribing the quality of legal tender to be assigned to it , a consideration of the first importance should be so to adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold coinage , which now constitutes our specie currency , as to accomplish the desired end of maintaining the circulation of the two metallic currencies and keeping up the volume of the two precious metals as our intrinsic money.\n",
      "###############################\n",
      "It is a mixed question , for scientific reasoning and historical experience to determine , how far and by what methods a practical equilibrium can be maintained which will keep both metals in circulation in their appropriate spheres of common use.\n",
      "###############################\n",
      "An absolute equality of commercial value , free from disturbing fluctuations , is hardly attainable , and without it an unlimited legal tender for private transactions assigned to both metals would irresistibly tend to drive out of circulation the clearer coinage and disappoint the principal object proposed by the legislation in view.\n",
      "###############################\n",
      "I apprehend , therefore , that the two conditions of a near approach to equality of commercial value between the gold and silver coinage of the same denomination and of a limitation of the amounts for which the silver coinage is to be a legal tender are essential to maintaining both in circulation.\n",
      "###############################\n",

      "Certainly the issue of our gold coinage , reduced in weight materially below its legal tender value , would not be any the less a present debasement of the coinage by reason of its equaling , or even exceeding , in weight a gold coinage which at some past time had been commercially equal to the legal tender value assigned to the new issue.\n",

      "###############################\n",
      "Because the Bill vests in the said incorporated Church , an authority to provide for the support of the poor , and the education of poor children of the same , an authority , which being altogether superfluous if the provision is to be the result of pious charity , would be a precident for giving to religious Societies as such , a legal agency in carrying into effect a public and civil duty.\n",

      "Instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the two nations , the orders were , at a moment when least to have been expected , put into more rigorous execution and it was communicated through the British envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the edicts of France , as officially made known to the British Government , was denied to have taken place , it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the British orders that commerce should restored to a footing that would admit the productions and manufactures of Great Britain , when owned by neutrals , into markets shut against them by her enemy , the United States being given to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their nonimportation act would lead to measures of retaliation.\n",
