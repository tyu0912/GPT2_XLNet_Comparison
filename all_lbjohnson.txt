Speaker,  President, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, my fellow Americans:All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today.
The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time.
Today John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind.
He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind.
He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen.
No words are sad enough to express our sense of loss.
No words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.
The dream of conquering the vastness of space  the dream of partnership across the Atlantic  and across the Pacific as well  the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations  the dream of education for all of our children  the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them  the dream of care for our elderly  the dream of an all-out attack on mental illness  and above all, the dream of equal rights for all Americans, whatever their race or color  these and other American dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication.
And now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action.
Under John Kennedy's leadership, this Nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace, and it has the fortitude to risk war.
We have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom.
We have shown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny.
This Nation will keep its commitments from South Viet-Nam to West Berlin.
We will be unceasing in the search for peace; resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with those with whom we differ; and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause.
In this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war, we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint.
We must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power.
We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest.
This is the path that we shall continue to pursue.
Those who test our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable.
We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength; and the just can be strong in the defense of justice.
And let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution.
We will carry on the fight against poverty and misery, and disease and ignorance, in other lands and in our own.
We will serve all the Nation, not one section or one sector, or one group, but all Americans.
These are the United States  a united people with a united purpose.
Our American unity does not depend upon unanimity.
We have differences; but now, as in the past, we can derive from those differences strength, not weakness, wisdom, not despair.
Both as a people and a government, we can unite upon a program, a program which is wise and just, enlightened and constructive.
For 32 years Capitol Hill has been my home.
I have shared many moments of pride with you, pride in the ability of the Congress of the United States to act, to meet any crisis, to distill from our differences strong programs of national action.
An assassin's bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the Presidency.
I am here today to say I need your help; I cannot bear this burden alone.
I need the help of all Americans, and all America.
This Nation has experienced a profound shock, and in this critical moment, it is our duty, yours and mine, as the Government of the United States, to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay, and to show that we are capable of decisive action; that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness, but strength; that we can and will act and act now.
From this chamber of representative government, let all the world know and none misunderstand that I rededicate this Government to the unswerving support of the United Nations, to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies, to the maintenance of military strength second to none, to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar, to the expansion of our foreign trade, to the reinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in Asia and Africa, and to our Alliance for Progress in this hemisphere.
On the 20th day of January, in 1961, John F.
Kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.
But, he said, let us begin.
Today, in this moment of new resolve, I would say to all my fellow Americans, let us continue.
This is our challenge  not to hesitate, not to pause, not to turn about and linger over this evil moment, but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us.
Our most immediate tasks are here on this Hill.
First, no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.
We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights.
We have talked for one hundred years or more.
It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law.
I urge you again, as I did in 1957 and again in 1960, to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this Nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color.
There could be no greater source of strength to this Nation both at home and abroad.
And second, no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year.
This is a bill designed to increase our national income and Federal revenues, and to provide insurance against recession.
That bill, if passed without delay, means more security for those now working, more jobs for those now without them, and more incentive for our economy.
In short, this is no time for delay.
It is a time for action  strong, forward-looking action on the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in America  strong, forward-looking action on youth employment opportunities; strong, forward-looking action on the pending foreign aid bill, making clear that we are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world, nor erasing Executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs  and strong, prompt, and forward-looking action on the remaining appropriation bills.
In this new spirit of action, the Congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch.
And in particular, I pledge that the expenditures of your Government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality.
I will insist that the Government get a dollar's value for a dollar spent.
The Government will set an example of prudence and economy.
This does not mean that we will not meet out unfilled needs or that we will not honor our commitments.
We will do both.
As one who has long served in both Houses of the Congress, I firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch.
And I promise you that I shall always respect this.
It is deep in the marrow of my bones.
With equal firmness, I believe in the capacity and I believe in the ability of the Congress, despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our Nation, to act  to act wisely, to act vigorously, to act speedily when the need arises.
The need is here.
The need is now.
I ask your help.
We meet in grief, but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor.
Let us meet in action, in tolerance, and in mutual understanding.
John Kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed  that America must move forward.
The time has come for Americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another.
So let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence.
Let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right, from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry, from those defiant of law, and those who pour venom into our Nation's bloodstream.
I profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship, making us one people in our hour of sorrow.
So let us here highly resolve that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not live  or die  in vain.
And on this Thanksgiving eve, as we gather together to ask the Lord's blessing, and give Him our thanks, let us unite in those familiar and cherished words:America, America,God shed His grace on thee,And crown thy goodWith brotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea.
My fellow Americans: On yesterday I went before the Congress to speak for the first time as President of the United States.
Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor.
All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget.
We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been, but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be, what is to be for America, for the world, for the cause we lead, for all the hopes that live in our hearts.
A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on.
Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose.
I am resolved that we shall win the tomorrows before us.
So I ask you to join me in that resolve, determined that from this midnight of tragedy, we shall move toward a new American greatness.
More than any generation before us, we have cause to be thankful, so thankful, on this Thanksgiving Day.
Our harvests are bountiful, our factories flourish, our homes are safe, our defenses are secure.
We live in peace.
The good will of the world pours out for us.
But more than these blessings, we know tonight that our system is strongstrong and secure.
A deed that was meant to tear us apart has bound us together.
Our system has passedyou have passeda great test.
You have shown what John F.
Kennedy called upon us to show in his proclamation of this Thanksgiving: that decency of purpose, that steadfastness of resolve, and that strength of will which we inherit from our forefathers.
What better conveys what is best for America than this?On Saturday, when these great burdens had been mine only hours, the first two citizens to call upon me and to offer their whole support were Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Harry S.
Truman.
Since last Friday, Americans have turned to the good, to the decent values of our life.
These have served us.
Yes, these have saved us.
The service of our public institution and our public men is the salvation of us all from the Supreme Court to the States.
And how much better would it be, how much more sane it would be, how much more decent and American it would be if all Americans could spend their fortunes and could give their time and spend their energies helping our system and its servants to solve your problems instead of pouring out the venom and the hate that stalemate us in progress.
I have served in Washington 32 years  32 years yesterday.
I have seen five Presidents fill this awesome office.
I have known them well and I have counted them all as friendsPresident Herbert Hoover, President Franklin Roosevelt, President Harry Truman, President Dwight Eisenhower, and President John Kennedy.
In each administration the greatest burden that the President had to bear had been the burden of his own countrymen's unthinking and unreasoning hate and division.
So, in these days, the fate of this office is the fate of us all.
I would ask all Americans on this day of prayer and reverence to think on these things.
Let all who speak and all who teach and all who preach and all who publish and all who broadcast and all who read or listen-let them reflect upon their responsibilities to bind our wounds, to heal our sores, to make our society well and whole for the tasks ahead of us.
It is this work that I most want us to do: to banish rancor from our words and malice from our hearts; to close down the poison spring of hatred and intolerance and fanaticism; to perfect our unity north and south, east and west; to hasten the day when bias of race, religion, and region is no more; and to bring the day when our great energies and decencies and spirit will be free of the burdens that we have borne too long.
Our view is outward, our thrust is forward, but we remember in our hearts this brave young man who lies in honored eternal rest across the Potomac.
We remember him; we remember his wonderful and courageous widow that we all love.
We remember Caroline and John and all the great family who gave the Nation this son and brother.
And to honor his memory and the future of the works he started, I have today determined that Station No.
1 of the Atlantic Missile Range and the NASA Launch Operation Center in Florida shall hereafter be known as the John F.
Kennedy Space Center.
I have also acted today with the understanding and the support of my friend, the Governor of Florida, Farris Bryant, to change the name of Cape Canaveral.
It shall be known hereafter as Cape Kennedy.
On this Thanksgiving Day, as we gather in the warmth of our families, in the mutual love and respect which we have for one another, and as we bow our heads in submission to divine providence, let us also thank God for the years that He gave us inspiration through His servant, John F.
Kennedy.
Let us today renew our dedication to the ideals that are American.
Let us pray for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skinsfor God made all of us, not some of us, in His image.
All of us, not just some of us, are His children.
And, finally, to you as your President, I ask that you remember your country and remember me each day in your prayers, and I pledge to you the best within me to work for a new American greatness, a new day when peace is more secure, when justice is more universal, when freedom is more strong in every home of all mankind.
Thank you and good night.

President,  Secretary General, distinguished delegates to the United Nations, ladies and gentlemen: We meet in a time of mourning, but in a moment of rededication.
My Nation has lost a great leader.
This organization has lost a great friend.
World peace has lost a great champion.
But John F.
Kennedy was the author of new hope for mankind, hope which was shared by a whole new generation of leaders in every continent, and we must not let grief turn us away from that hope.
He never quarreled with the past.
He always looked at the future.
And our task now is to work for the kind of future in which he so strongly believed.
I have come here today to make it unmistakably clear that the assassin's bullet which took his life did not alter his Nation's purpose.
We are more than ever opposed to the doctrines of hate and violence, in our own land and around the world.
We are more than ever committed to the rule of law, in our own land and around the world.
We believe more than ever in the rights of man, all men of every color, in our own land and around the world.
And more than ever we support the United Nations as the best instrument yet devised to promote the peace of the world and to promote the well-being of mankind.
I can tell you today, as I told you in 1958 when I came as Majority Leader of the United States Senate to the first committee of this great tribunal, that the full power and partnership of the United States is committed to our joint effort to eliminate war and the threat of war, aggression and the danger of violence, and to lift from all people everywhere the blight of disease, and poverty, and illiteracy.
I.
Like all human institutions, the United Nations has not achieved the highest of hopes that some held at its birth.
Our understanding of how to live, live with one another, is still far behind our knowledge of how to destroy one another.
But as our problems have grown, this Organization has grown, in numbers, in authority, in prestige, and its member nations have grown with it, in responsibility and in maturity.
We have seen too much success to become obsessed with failure.
The peace-keeping machinery of the United Nations has worked in the Congo, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.
The great transition from colonial rule to independence has been largely accomplished.
The Decade of Development has successfully begun.
The world arms race has been slowed.
The struggle for human rights has been gaining new force.
And a start has been made in furthering mankind's common interest in outer space-in scientific exploration, in communications, in weather forecasting, in banning the stationing of nuclear weapons, and in establishing principles of law.
I know that vast problems remain, conflicts between great powers, conflicts between small neighbors, disagreements over disarmament, persistence of ancient wrongs in the area of human rights, residual problems , of colonialism, and all the rest.
But men and nations, working apart, created these problems, and men and nations working together must solve them.
They can solve them with the help of this Organization, when all members make it a workshop for constructive action, and not a forum for abuse; when all members seek its help in settling their own disputes as well as the disputes of others; when all members meet their financial obligations to it; and when all members recognize that no nation and no party and no single system can control the future of man.
II When I entered the Congress of the United States 27 years ago, it was my very great privilege to work closely with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
As a Member of Congress, I worked with him to bring about a profound but peaceful revolution.
That peaceful revolution brought help and hope to the one-third of our Nation that was then ill-housed, ill-clad, and ill-nourished.
We helped our working men and women obtain more jobs and we helped them obtain better wages.
We helped our farmers to buy and improve their own land, and conserve their soil and water, and electrify their farms.
We harnessed the powers of the great rivers, as in the Tennessee Valley and the Lower Colorado.
We encouraged the growth of cooperatives and trade unions.
We curbed the excesses of private speculation.
We built homes in the place of city slums.
And we extended the rights of freedom to all of our citizens.
Now, on the world scale, the time has come, as it came to America 30 years ago, for a new era of hope, hope and progress for that one-third of mankind that is still beset by hunger and poverty and disease.
In my travels on behalf of my country and President Kennedy, I have seen too much of misery and despair in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America.
I have seen too often the ravages of hunger, and tapeworm and tuberculosis, and the scabs and the scars on too many children who have too little health and no hope.
I think that you and I and our countries and this Organization can, and must, do something about these conditions.
I am not speaking here of a new way of life to be imposed by any single nation.
I am speaking of a higher standard of living, to be inspired by these United Nations.
It will not be achieved through some hopeful resolution in this assembly, but through a peaceful revolution in the world, through a recommitment of all our members, rich and poor, and strong and weak, whatever their location or their ideology, to the basic principles of human welfare and of human dignity.
In this effort, the United States will do its full share.
In addition to bilateral aid, we have with great satisfaction assisted in recent years in the emergence and the improvement of international developmental institutions, both within and without this Organization.
We favor the steady improvement of collective machinery for helping the less-developed nations build modern societies.
We favor an international aid program that is international in practice as well as purpose.
Every nation must do its share.
All United Nations and their members can do better.
We can act more often together.
We can build together a much better world.
III The greatest of human problems, and the greatest of our common tasks, is to keep the peace and to save the future.
All that we have built in the wealth of nations, and all that we plan to do toward a better life for all, will be in vain if our feet should slip, or our vision falter, and our hopes ended in another worldwide war.
If there is one commitment more than any other that I would like to leave with you today, it is my unswerving commitment to the keeping and to the strengthening of the peace.
Peace is a journey of a thousand miles, and it must be taken one step at a time.
We know what we want: The United States of America wants to see the cold war end, we want to see it end once and for all;The United States wants to prevent the dissemination of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them;The United States wants to press on with arms control and reduction;The United States wants to cooperate with all the members of this Organization to conquer everywhere the ancient enemies of mankindhunger, and disease and ignorance;The United States wants sanity, and security, and peace for all, and above all.
President Kennedy, I am sure, would regard as his best memorial the fact that in his3 years as President the world became a little safer and the way ahead became a little brighter.
To the protection and the enlargement of this new hope for peace, I pledge my country and its Government.
IV My friends and fellow citizens of the world, soon you will return to your homelands.
I hope you will take with you my gratitude for your generosity in hearing me so late in the session.
I hope you will convey to your countrymen the gratitude of all Americans for the companionship of sorrow which you shared with us in your messages of the last few weeks.
And I hope that you will tell them that the United States of America, sobered by tragedy, united in sorrow, renewed in spirit, faces the New Year determined that world peace, civil rights, and human welfare become not an illusion but a reality.
Man's age-old hopes remain our goal: that this world, under God, can be safe for diversity, and free from hostility, and a better place for our children and for all generations in the years to come.
And therefore any man and any nation that seeks peace, and hates war, and is willing to fight the good fight against hunger and disease and ignorance and misery, will find the United States of America by their side, willing to walk with them, walk with them every step of the way.
Thank you very much.

I hope you will convey to your countrymen the gratitude of all Americans for the companionship of sorrow which you shared with us in your messages of the last few weeks.
And I hope that you will tell them that the United States of America, sobered by tragedy, united in sorrow, renewed in spirit, faces the New Year determined that world peace, civil rights, and human welfare become not an illusion but a reality.
Man's age-old hopes remain our goal: that this world, under God, can be safe for diversity, and free from hostility, and a better place for our children and for all generations in the years to come.
And therefore any man and any nation that seeks peace, and hates war, and is willing to fight the good fight against hunger and disease and ignorance and misery, will find the United States of America by their side, willing to walk with them, walk with them every step of the way.
Thank you very much.
Speaker,  President, members of the House and Senate, my fellow Americans: I will be brief, for our time is necessarily short and our agenda is already long.
Last year's congressional session was the longest in peacetime history.
With that foundation, let us work together to make this year's session the best in the nation's history.
Let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined; as the session which enacted the most far-reaching tax cut of our time; as the session which declared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States; as the session which finally recognized the health needs of all our older citizens; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation and transit policies; as the session which achieved the most effective, efficient foreign aid program ever; and as the session which helped to build more homes, more schools, more libraries, and more hospitals than any single session of Congress in the history of our Republic.
All this and more can and must be done.
It can be done by this summer, and it can be done without any increase in spending.
In fact, under the budget that I shall shortly submit, it can be done with an actual reduction in federal expenditures and federal employment.
We have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation  to prove the success of our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence.
If we fail, if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless, senseless quarrels between Democrats and Republicans, or between the House and the Senate, or between the South and North, or between the Congress and the administration, then history will rightfully judge us harshly.
But if we succeed, if we can achieve these goals by forging in this country a greater sense of union, then, and only then, can we take full satisfaction in the state of the Union.
Here in the Congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership by discharging the public business with clarity and dispatch, voting each important proposal up, or voting it down, but at least bringing it to a fair and a final vote.
Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy  not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.
In his memory today, I especially ask all members of my own political faith, in this election year, to put your country ahead of your party, and to always debate principles; never debate personalities.
For my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient, and honest and frugal.
The budget to be submitted to the Congress shortly is in full accord with this pledge.
It will cut our deficit in half  from $10 billion to $4,900 million.
It will be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since 1951.
It will call for a substantial reduction in federal employment, a feat accomplished only once before in the last 10 years.
While maintaining the full strength of our combat defenses, it will call for the lowest number of civilian personnel in the Department of Defense since 1950.
It will call for total expenditures of $97,900 million  compared to $98,400 million for the current year, a reduction of more than $500 million.
It will call for new obligational authority of $103,800 million  a reduction of more than $4 billion below last year's request of $107,900 million.
But it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand still.
Our population is growing.
Our economy is more complex.
Our people's needs are expanding.
But by closing down obsolete installations, by curtailing less urgent programs, by cutting back where cutting back seems to be wise, by insisting on a dollar's worth for a dollar spent, I am able to recommend in this reduced budget the most federal support in history for education, for health, for retraining the unemployed, and for helping the economically and the physically handicapped.
This budget, and this year's legislative program, are designed to help each and every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes  his hopes for a fair chance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a full-time job on full-time pay; his hopes for a decent home for his family in a decent community; his hopes for a good school for his children with good teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or unemployment or old age.
Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope  some because of their poverty, and some because of theft color, and all too many because of both.
Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.
This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America.
I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me in that effort.
It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won.
The richest nation on earth can afford to win it.
We cannot afford to lose it.
One thousand dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return $40,000 or more in his lifetime.
Poverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization and support.
But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at the state and the local level and must be supported and directed by state and local efforts.
For the war against poverty will not be won here in Washington.
It must be won in the field, in every private home, in every public office, from the courthouse to the White House.
The program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to help that one-fifth of all American families with incomes too small to even meet their basic needs.
Our chief weapons in a more pinpointed attack will be better schools, and better health, and better homes, and better training, and better job opportunities to help more Americans, especially young Americans, escape from squalor and misery and unemployment rolls where other citizens help to carry them.
Very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of poverty, but the symptom.
The cause may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow citizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities, in a lack of education and training, in a lack of medical care and housing, in a lack of decent communities in which to live and bring up their children.
But whatever the cause, our joint federal-local effort must pursue poverty, pursue it wherever it exists  in city slums and small towns, in sharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps, on Indian Reservations, among whites as well as Negroes, among the young as well as the aged, in the boom towns and in the depressed areas.
Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it.
No single piece of legislation, however, is going to suffice.
We will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed areas of Appalachia.
We must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program.
We must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless, aimless, hopeless youngsters to work on useful projects.
We must distribute more food to the needy through a broader food stamp program.
We must create a National Service Corps to help the economically handicapped of our own country as the Peace Corps now helps those abroad.
We must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high-level commission on automation.
If we have the brain power to invent these machines, we have the brain power to make certain that they are a boon and not a bane to humanity.
We must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than two million workers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.
We must, by including special school aid funds as part of our education program, improve the quality of teaching, training, and counseling in our hardest hit areas.
We must build more libraries in every area and more hospitals and nursing homes under the Hill-Burton Act, and train more nurses to staff them.
We must provide hospital insurance for our older citizens financed by every worker and his employer under Social Security, contributing no more than $1 a month during the employee's working career to protect him in his old age in a dignified manner without cost to the Treasury, against the devastating hardship of prolonged or repeated illness.
We must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give more help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for our poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free enterprise system a decent home for every American family.
We must help obtain more modern mass transit within our communities as well as low-cost transportation between them.
Above all, we must release $11 billion of tax reduction into the private spending stream to create new jobs and new markets in every area of this land.
These programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone.
Every American will benefit by the extension of social security to cover the hospital costs of their aged parents.
Every American community will benefit from the construction or modernization of schools, libraries, hospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of more nurses and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit.
And every individual American taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the earliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new investment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create.
That tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year.
Now we need action.
The new budget clearly allows it.
Our taxpayers surely deserve it.
Our economy strongly demands it.
And every month of delay dilutes its benefits in 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for employment.
For until the bill is signed, its investment incentives cannot be deemed certain, and the withholding rate cannot be reduced  and the most damaging and devastating thing you can do to any businessman in America is to keep him in doubt and to keep him guessing on what our tax policy is.
And I say that we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15 percent our withholding rate.
I therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the first of February, if at all possible.
For however proud we may be of the unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last three years, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause.
In 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70-million job mark, but we will soon need more than 75 million jobs.
In 1963 our gross national product reached the $600 billion level  $100 billion higher than when we took office.
But it easily could and it should be still $30 billion higher today than it is.
Wages and profits and family income are also at their highest levels in history  but I would remind you that four million workers and 13 percent of our industrial capacity are still idle today.
We need a tax cut now to keep this country moving.
For our goal is not merely to spread the work.
Our goal is to create more jobs.
I believe the enactment of a 35-hour week would sharply increase costs, would invite inflation, would impair our ability to compete, and merely share instead of creating employment.
But I am equally opposed to the 45- or 50-hour week in those industries where consistently excessive use of overtime causes increased unemployment.
So, therefore, I recommend legislation authorizing the creation of a tripartite industry committee to determine on an industry-by-industry basis as to where a higher penalty rate for overtime would increase job openings without unduly increasing costs, and authorizing the establishment of such higher rates.
Let me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear: All of these increased opportunities  in employment, in education, in housing, and in every field  must be open to Americans of every color.
As far as the writ of federal law will run, we must abolish not some, but all racial discrimination.
For this is not merely an economic issue, or a social, political, or international issue.
It is a moral issue, and it must be met by the passage this session of the bill now pending in the House.
All members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to the public.
All members of the public should be equally eligible for federal benefits that are financed by the public.
All members of the public should have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their children to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the public good.
Today, Americans of all races stand side by side in Berlin and in Vietnam.
They died side by side in Korea.
Surely they can work and eat and travel side by side in their own country.
We must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed skills and those joining their families.
In establishing preferences, a nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: What can you do for our country? But we should not be asking: In what country were you born? For our ultimate goal is a world without war, a world made safe for diversity, in which all men, goods, and ideas can freely move across every border and every boundary.
We must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different ways, not as partisans, but as patriots.
First, we must maintain  and our reduced defense budget will maintain  that margin of military safety and superiority obtained through three years of steadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic, our conventional, and our antiguerilla forces.
In 1964 we will be better prepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom, whether it is threatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those in Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and men across international borders to foment insurrection.
And we must continue to use that strength as John Kennedy used it in the Cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty  to demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of lasting peace.
Second, we must take new steps  and we shall make new proposals at Geneva  toward the control and the eventual abolition of arms.
Even in the absence of agreement, we must not stockpile arms beyond our needs or seek an excess of military power that could be provocative as well as wasteful.
It is in this spirit that in this fiscal year we are cutting back our production of enriched uranium by 25 percent.
We are shutting down four plutonium piles.
We are closing many nonessential military installations.
And it is in this spirit that we today call on our adversaries to do the same.
Third, we must make increased use of our food as an instrument of peace  making it available by sale or trade or loan or donation  to hungry people in all nations which tell us of their needs and accept proper conditions of distribution.
Fourth, we must assure our pre-eminence in the peaceful exploration of outer space, focusing on an expedition to the moon in this decade  in cooperation with other powers if possible, alone if necessary.
Fifth, we must expand world trade.
Having recognized in the Act of 1962 that we must buy as well as sell, we now expect our trading partners to recognize that we must sell as well as buy.
We are willing to give them competitive access to our market, asking only that they do the same for us.
Sixth, we must continue, through such measures as the interest equalization tax, as well as the cooperation of other nations, our recent progress toward balancing our international accounts.
This administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the dollar.
Seventh, we must become better neighbors with the free states of the Americas, working with the councils of the OAS, with a stronger Alliance for Progress, and with all the men and women of this hemisphere who really believe in liberty and justice for all.
Eighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to develop their independence and raise their standard of living, and thereby frustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos.
To do this, the rich must help the poor  and we must do our part.
We must achieve a more rigorous administration of our development assistance, with larger roles for private investors, for other industrialized nations, and for international agencies and for the recipient nations themselves.
Ninth, we must strengthen our Atlantic and Pacific partnerships, maintain our alliances and make the United Nations a more effective instrument for national independence and international order.
Tenth, and finally, we must develop with our allies new means of bridging the gap between the East and the West, facing danger boldly wherever danger exists, but being equally bold in our search for new agreements which can enlarge the hopes of all, while violating the interests of none.
In short, I would say to the Congress that we must be constantly prepared for the worst, and constantly acting for the best.
We must be strong enough to win any war, and we must be wise enough to prevent one.
We shall neither act as aggressors nor tolerate acts of aggression.
We intend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried.
We can fight, if we must, as we have fought before, but we pray that we will never have to fight again.
My good friends and my fellow Americans: In these last seven sorrowful weeks, we have learned anew that nothing is so enduring as faith, and nothing is so degrading as hate.
John Kennedy was a victim of hate, but he was also a great builder of faith  faith in our fellow Americans, whatever their creed or their color or their station in life; faith in the future of man, whatever his divisions and differences.
This faith was echoed in all parts of the world.
On every continent and in every land to which  Johnson and I traveled, we found faith and hope and love toward this land of America and toward our people.
So I ask you now in the Congress and in the country to join with me in expressing and fulfilling that faith in working for a nation, a nation that is free from want and a world that is free from hate  a world of peace and justice, and freedom and abundance, for our time and for all time to come.
This past week the United States has demonstrated anew in at least eight different situations this Nation's determination to insure both peace and freedom in the widest possible areas.
Progress toward these ends is frequently slow and rarely dramatic, but it should be viewed in the perspective of history and not headlines.
First, we have been patiently continuing our efforts to resume relations with our neighbors in Panama, and to reconsider with them, without preconditions on either side, all issues which threaten to divide us.
Second, we have been quietly working on the Cyprus crisis with our friends, to determine the most useful role that each of us can play in easing the present strains on the island.
Third, in response to my request, I have received assurances from the new and friendly leaders of Viet-Nam that they are proceeding immediately to step up the pace of military operations against the Viet Cong, with specific instructions to the corps commanders and a personal visit by General Khanh to the vital delta area.
Fourth, we have been consulting with all parties concerned in the Indonesian-Malaysian dispute, including the United Nations, to follow up on the Attorney General's successful efforts in arranging for a cease-fire and a discussion at the conference table.
Fifth, we have been in constant consultation with our allies regarding the troubled course of independence in several East African states where we can hardly expect to control events, but we can help these nations preserve their freedom from foreign domination.
Sixth, we have been confronted with the brutal shooting down of an unarmed American plane off course in East Germany, and the necessity for preventing further incidents of this kind.
Seventh, in view of the french recognition of Red China, we have been discussing with the free nations of Asia the necessity of resisting any further temptations to reward the Peking regime for its defiance of world peace and order.
And finally, we have witnessed and the whole world has witnessed with pleasure the remarkable success of our Saturn rocket, the most powerful rocket thrust known to man.
This rocket, I am happy to say, was first recommended by our committee in 1958.
It is not our desire or in our interest to create an air of emergency about these or other events.
Our work proceeds both day and night, quietly, steadily, I believe confidently, and I think the American people have every reason to share in that confidence.
I have a few announcements to make in the defense area.
first, I am gratified by the results from the letters to defense contractors 1 that I sent out less than a month ago.
We have received almost 800 replies to that letter.
The Defense Department has talked with many businessmen directly.
This is going to be an important part of the effort which we believe is going to produce savings to the taxpayers of over $4 billion per year in fiscal 1967.
The savings to be effected by the Department of Defense, the White House announced on January 27, would be the result of a vigorous program to shift from contracting on a cost-plus-fixed fee basis to fixed price or incentive contracts, and of reducing the number of letter contracts, preliminary agreements under which contractors may start work before a price is agreed on.
Second, I want to draw your attention today to the cost reduction section of the Defense Department budget statement which was released last week.
Some figures in there should be of interest to every taxpayer.
Next year's Defense budget, the one just sent up for fiscal 1965, includes, due to more efficient management of our defenses, $2 4/10 billion.
That is more than $10 for every man, woman, and child in our country.
That has come about because of more efficient management under  McNamara and the men who serve with him.
That is money that is strictly saved in the coming fiscal year simply by following more sensible and efficient procedures.
It is money saved not by risking this country's security, not by cutting our defenses, but by running the Department on a sound and businesslike basis, and with real unification.
I have seen more unification present and achieved in the Defense Department than at any time since the Department was created.
We are, in fact, constantly making improvements in our strategic missile arsenal.
We are improving the payloads, the accuracies, the reliability of all of these weapons.
We are also adding new weapons to our arsenal.
We are now completing development, for example, on three new and highly advanced weapons systems.
I think you would like to hear something about this, because you can take great pride in it.
first, the first of these is the Redeye.
for the first time our ground combat soldier will be able to fight back against a high performance enemy aircraft.
The Redeye, which he can fire from the shoulder like a rifle, sends a heat-seeking missile in pursuit of the enemy airplane, with a very high probability of scoring.
Once hit, the airplane will go down.
Redeye has been developed by the Pomona Division of General Dynamics at Pomona, Calif.
Second, the Shillelagh has successfully completed engineering tests and is being released for production.
It is an antitank missile mounted on a vehicle so light that we can parachute it into the battlefield, and so accurate that it can destroy a tank at a range of several thousand yards.
And finally, the Navy has recently demonstrated the Walleye, a glide bomb to be launched from an airplane and guided to its target by television.
The bomb has a television camera which is focused through remote control by the pilot in the airplane.
Once the pilot has focused the camera on the target, the mechanism in the bomb takes over, watches the television screen inside the bomb, and then guides it until it reaches the target.
The Walleye has been demonstrated and it has shown amazing accuracy at a range of several miles.
It is being developed by the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, Calif.
, where the now famous Sidewinder missile was developed.
Finally, I conferred at length yesterday with Sargent Shriver, who has just returned from a world trip, and I have asked him to serve as Special Assistant to the President in the organization and the ado ministration of the war on poverty program which I announced in my State of the Union Message.
Shriver will continue to serve as Director of the Peace Corps.
He will begin immediately to study the formulation and the execution of the concentrated assault on the causes and cures of poverty in the United States.
I expect to appoint a committee of the Cabinet to serve in an advisory capacity with him, a Cabinet committee to be made up of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Labor, the Attorney General, the various departments, that would be Interior and Agriculture, that would be concerned with our war on poverty.
Shriver is eminently qualified for this additional assignment.
As you know, he is Executive Director of the Joseph P.
Kennedy foundation, he was President of the Chicago School Board, he is a very successful businessman.
He is an organizer and Director of the Peace Corps.
He has demonstrated outstanding qualities of leadership, and I am sure that we will find that in the organization and draft of the message as well as the administration of the poverty program, if it is approved by Congress, we will find him an exceptionally well-qualified employee.
Now I would like to conclude by reading a brief message that I have just sent to General Khanh in Viet-Nam, in which I say:I am glad to know that we see eye to eye on the necessity of stepping up the pace of military operations against the Viet Cong.
I particularly appreciate your warm and immediate response to my message as conveyed by Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins.
We shall continue to be available to help you to carry the war to the enemy, and to increase the confidence of the Vietnamese people in their government.
A couple of days ago I sent General Khanh a message urging him to step up the pace of military operations.
He immediately replied, as I announced in my more formal statement, and this is my personal, longhand reply to the General.
Now, any questions? No, I do not.
The Senate committee is now making a study of the accuracy of some of the allegations that you have made.
They will, in their wisdom, determine the accuracy of those allegations and, I am sure, render proper judgment.
I do not have an answer to that question of yours.
I thought that this would be ample to take care of your needs.
I am sorry if you find yourselves uncomfortable.
It was much more convenient to come here at the time that I could come, and I was attempting to satisfy the newsmen.
It is somewhat difficult to do sometimes, but they wanted a news conference this week, and I thought this was the appropriate place and could be best handled here.
No, I do not have any favorite opponent.
It is not my duty to select my opposition.
I think that the delegates to the Republican Convention will act wisely and select the best man that is available to them.
And so far as I am concerned, I hope to keep as free from politics as I can, as long as I can, because I think it is in the interest of the continuity and transition of this administration and the unity of the country to keep free from mudslinging and petty politics and getting into any political battles.
I have asked the Democrats to refrain from indulging in any personalities if at all possible.
We will have debates about principles and we expect differences of opinion.
We do not want to suppress them or silence them.
But I found in the 8 years that I served as Democratic Leader under President Eisenhower that it was not necessary to sling mud or to indulge in personalities, and I hope that our Democratic people will follow that course.
What the Republicans do is a matter for them to determine in their wisdom.
If we could have neutralization of both North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Nam, I am sure that would be considered sympathetically.
But I see no indication of that at the moment.
I think that if we could expect the Viet Cong to let their neighbors live in peace, we could take a much different attitude.
But as long as these raids are continuing and people are attempting to envelop South Viet-Nam, I think that the present course we are conducting is the only answer to that course, and I think that the operations should be stepped up there.
I see no sentiment favoring neutralization of South Viet-Nam alone, and I think the course that we are following is the most advisable one for freedom at this point.
I would think that it would be premature and somewhat presumptuous at this point for me to go into any detailed discussion on the selection of a Vice President.
I think that if I am nominated by the convention, selected as their standard bearer, my recommendations will likely be sought, and if so, I will be glad to give them.
And at that time I will cross that bridge.
I hope that I can act wisely and in the best interests of the American people.
No.
I feel that I have not gone into the details of the fight.
I am aware of the issue.
I concur in the judgment that Secretary McNamara has made.
I think that we are looking far into the future and that those judgments are always susceptible to error.
But at this moment I would conclude that his decision has been a reasonable one and a fair one and one in which I agree.
The answer to your first question is that I think that in the 60 days that I have held this office we have made great progress in legislation.
When I came into it, we had gone along down the road with our educational bills, but we finally consummated them, and I think we have the best educational Congress in the history of the Republic.
We had 5 or 6 appropriations bills out of 15 passed.
We concluded action on those during this period of time.
We have reported the civil rights bill from the Rules Committee, and it is now being debated in the House.
I hope and I believe that it will be passed without any crippling amendments.
I think it should be passed without any crippling amendments.
I think that due progress is being made there.
I hope it is acted upon in the House before the Members leave to attend Lincoln Day birthday meetings throughout the Nation, because it would be a great tribute to President Lincoln to have that bill finally acted upon in the House before we go out to celebrate his birthday.
On the tax bill, it has been before the Congress now for almost 13 months.
The Senate has reported it, the Senate committee has reported it to the Senate.
It is being debated there.
There are some 180-odd technical amendments and there will be dozens of other amendments.
It will be carefully deliberated, but I hope that we can pass it before we take a recess for Lincoln's Birthday on February 12.
I am pleased with the progress made on both of those bills.
I hope the tax bill can withstand the onslaughts that will be made by many in attempting to amend it in the next few days, and then will go to conference.
And I would like to see it reported from conference as nearly to the administration's recommendations as possible, because before those recommendations were submitted to Congress, I participated in their formulation and embraced them.
Now, there are other important items.
We have a good many items in the national resource legislation field, like the wilderness bill and others.
We have a good many measures we must pass in the agricultural field, farm legislation, which we consider very important.
We consider medical care a very important measure, and I have already talked to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee about it.
I have talked to leading Republicans who have a substitute plan that they have proposed, which I am now studying and giving some thought to, trying to determine the merits of it.
But I hope that we can pass a medicare bill out of the House Ways and Means Committee and through the Congress this year based on the social security principle.
I can think of no single piece of legislation that I would be happier to approve than that bill.
The housing legislation  I could spend most of this time telling you how important I think it is.
It is one of the most comprehensive bills in the history of the Nation.
I hope that we can work toward the goal of someday every American owning his home.
I think that this message goes in that direction.
I have reviewed it carefully, both at the ranch and here in Washington, with Administrator Weaver.
We will start hearings on it very shortly in both bodies.
It is extremely important.
I think that we have an administration program that is going to be difficult to enact before the conventions, but with cooperation from all people on both sides of the aisle I hope we will attain a major part of it.
To your second question, I would say that I do put medical care high on the priority list.
Yes.
I do not agree with General de Gaulle's proposals.
I do not think that it would be in the interest of freedom to share his view.
General de Gaulle is entitled to his opinion.
He has expressed it.
We have expressed ours.
We think the course of action that we are following in Southeast Asia is the only course for us to follow, and the most advisable at this time.
We plan to pursue it diligently and, we hope, successfully on a stepped-up basis.
I would rather not express it in terms of optimism or pessimism.
I would rather say that it should be the goal of every leader in the world today to try to find areas of agreement that will lead to disarmament.
We are seriously, dedicatedly, doing our very best and trying to initiate and develop every conceivable fresh proposal we can that will lead to that end.
No, I do not think it will have to be substantially trimmed.
And yes, I do expect a filibuster.
I supported that platform and embraced that platform, and stated that view in 43 States in the Union.
I realize there has been discrimination in the employment of women, and I am doing my best to do something about it.
I am hopeful that in the next month we will have made substantial advances in that field.
The general question was raised with me at my last meeting.
I spoke with candor and frankness on that subject, about all I knew about it.
I said then that I did not plan to make any more statements on it, and I do not.
Well, you will have to ask General de Gaulle about the details of his proposal.
But as I understand it, the neutralization talk has applied only to South Viet-Nam and not to the whole of that area of the world.
I think that the only thing we need to do to have complete peace in that area of the world now is to stop the invasion of South Viet-Nam by some of its neighbors and supporters.
On all three of them.
And I am unaware of any differences among my advisers in that field.
We have a group from the Cabinet that has given considerable attention to that and we are now developing recommendations.
Those recommendations will be contained in a message.
But my answer to your question is, first, I know of no disagreement among my advisers; two, I think the message will emphasize all three areas.
That message is being very carefully worked out and will be coordinated with all of the advisers who have responsibilities in those fields.
We expect to get through the regular appropriations bills in excess of a half billion dollars to be coordinated into the poverty program so that it will be essential that we have the cooperation of all the Cabinet departments to whom the money is appropriated.
Thank you,  President.
I take pleasure this morning in announcing my intention of nominating  William P.
Bundy as the Assistant Secretary of State for far Eastern Affairs.
Bundy, currently the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, will bring to his new post great background and experience in the far Eastern field.
Bundy will be replaced in the Defense Department post by  John McNaughton, the current General Counsel at the Department of Defense.
I also wish to announce the appointment of  Daniel M.
Luevano, of California, as Assistant Secretary of the Army.
Luevano is the Chief Deputy Director of the State Department of finance in California, under Governor Brown, and has consistently demonstrated his ability in a number of governmental posts in his native State, having formerly been assistant to  Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California.
I would also like to announce the appointment of  Frankie Muse freeman, Associate General Counsel of the  Louis Housing and Land Clearance Authority, as a new member of the Civil Rights Commission.
freeman is a former Assistant Attorney General of the State of Missouri, and distinguished Missouri lawyer.
The United States has successfully developed an advanced experimental jet aircraft, the A-11, which has been tested in sustained flight at more than 2,000 miles an hour, and at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet.
The performance of the A-11 far exceeds that of any other aircraft in the world today.
The development of this aircraft has been made possible by major advances in aircraft technology of great significance for both military and commercial application.
Several A-11 aircraft are now being flight tested at Edwards Air force Base in California.
The existence of this program is being disclosed today to permit the orderly exploitation of this advanced technology in our military and commercial programs.
This advanced experimental aircraft, capable of high speed and high altitude, and long-range performance at thousands of miles, constitutes a technological accomplishment that will facilitate the achievement of a number of important military and commercial requirements.
The A-11 aircraft now at Edwards Air force Base are undergoing extensive tests to determine their capabilities as long-range interceptors.
The development of a supersonic commercial transport aircraft will' also be greatly assisted by the lessons learned from this A-11 program.
for example, one of the most important technical achievements in this project has been the mastery of the metallurgy and fabrication of titanium metal which is required for the high temperatures experienced by aircraft traveling at more than three times the speed of sound.
Arrangements are being made to make this and other important technical developments available under appropriate safeguards to those directly engaged in the supersonic transport program.
This project was first started in 1959.
Appropriate Members of the Senate and the House have been kept fully informed on the program since the day of its inception.
The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation at Burbank, Calif.
, is the manufacturer of the aircraft.
The aircraft engine, the 1-58, was designed and built by the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Corporation.
The experimental fire control and air-to-air missile system for the A-11 was developed by the Hughes Aircraft Company.
In view of the continuing importance of these developments to our national security, the detailed performance of the A-11 will remain strictly classified and all individuals associated with the program have been directed to refrain from making any further disclosure concerning this program.
I do not expect to discuss this important matter further with you today but certain additional information will be made available to all of you after this meeting.
If you care,  Salinger will make the appropriate arrangements.
On Monday I will release a report by  Eugene Black and  Osborne on the supersonic transport program.
This report was submitted to me in December.
It makes a number of recommendations dealing with the financing and the management of the supersonic transport program.
It has been referred to those Government officials concerned for review and comment.
On the basis of their analysis, a decision will be made on how the Government will proceed.
I will be glad to take any questions.
I do not handle my own security.
I was informed that there had been reasons for taking additional precautions, and I asked that the matter be carefully examined and handled entirely by  J.
Edgar Hoover and the Secret Service, both of whom work closely together in connection with the President's security.
And we followed the suggestions outlined, none of which I am familiar with in detail.
I think that is a matter that the Senate is considering.
They have witnesses to be heard.
The Senate will make its report and take such action as they feel is justified, and I am sure they will take the proper action.
We will have to see what the consequences are, following their recommendations when all of the evidence is in.
We have asked Secretary McNamara, who has made 'periodic visits to Saigon, to go to Viet-Nam in the next few days.
He will go there and have his conferences and will bring back very valuable information.
We have a very difficult situation in Viet-Nam.
We are furnishing advice and counsel and training to the South Viet-Nam army.
And we must rely on them for such action as is taken to defend themselves.
We think that  McNamara will correctly appraise the situation on this trip and make such recommendations as he deems appropriate.
I do not think that the speculation that has been made that we should enter into a neutralization of that area, or that we are losing the fight in that area, or that things have gone to pot there, are at all justified.
I think that they do our cause a great disservice, but we are keeping in close touch with it daily.
We have Ambassador Lodge, who heads our forces in that area.
He is in constant communication with us.
He makes recommendations from time to time.
We act promptly on those recommendations.
We feel that we are following the proper course and that our national interests are being fully protected.
I know of no good purpose that would be served by speculating on the military strategy of the forces of the South Vietnamese.
I think that too much speculation has already taken placeI think that a good deal of it without justification.
I sometimes wonder if General Eisenhower, before the battle of Normandy, had been confronted with all theif the world had all the information concerning his plans that they seem to have concerning ours in Viet-Nam, what would have happened on that fateful day.
So, I would answer your question merely by saying that I do not care to speculate on what might happen.
The plans that have been discussed in the papers are not plans that have come to my attention, or that I have approved.
No, I do not think so.
Lodge had a brilliant career in the Senate.
He served in the United States Army after resigning from the Senate.
He had considerable military experience there.
He served his country well at the United Nations under the administration of President Eisenhower.
He was selected by President Kennedy upon the recommendation of Secretary Rusk.
He has been given full authority to act as our top adviser in that area.
He had a long conference with me before he returned to Viet-Nam in November.
I am unaware of any political inclinations he may have.
I have seen nothing that he has done that has in any way interfered with his work out there.
I think that he has properly assessed the situation himself by saying that since he is our Ambassador there he cannot personally get involved in the campaign plans that some of his friends may have for him.
I would hope that we could reach an agreement as early as possible.
As soon as I learned that the Panamanians had marched on our zone and we had a disturbance there, and some of our soldiers had been killed, some of the students had raised the flag and this disturbance had resulted, I immediately called the President of Panama on the telephone and said to him in that first exchange, I want to do everything I can to work this problem out peacefully and quickly.
Therefore our people will meet with your people any time, anywhere, to discuss anything that will result in bringing peace and stopping violence.
The President asked me how long it would be before those discussions could take place, and I said we would have a team in the air within 30 minutes.
I designated Assistant Secretary Mann to leave immediately.
We have been pursuing those discussions ever since.
We have reached no agreement.
One day you see speculation that an agreement is imminent.
The next day you see speculation that we are very pessimistic.
I think both reports have been wrong.
There has been no meeting of the minds.
We realize that treaties were written in 1903and modified from time to timethat problems are involved that need to be dealt with and perhaps would require adjustment in the treaty in 1963 or 1964.
So we are not refusing to discuss and evolve a program that will be fair and just to all concerned.
But we are not going to make any precommitments, before we sit down, on what we are going to do in the way of rewriting new treaties with a nation that we do not have diplomatic relations with.
Once those relations are restored, we will be glad, as I said the first day, and as we have repeated every day since, to discuss anything, any time, anywhere, and do what is just and what is fair and what is right.
Just because Panama happens to be a small nation, maybe no larger than the city of  Louis, is no reason why we should not try in every way to be equitable and fair and just.
We are going to insist on that.
But we are going to be equally insistent on no preconditions.
The United States has made the proper protestations and is doing everything we can to see that that agreement reached is carried out.
We have expressed our deep regret that it has not been.
We are very hopeful that the interested governments will take the appropriate action to see that the agreement is carried out.
We must be concerned not just with our foreign policy in the twentieth century but with the foreign policy of 110 or 120 other nations.
We are today dealing with serious problems in many places in the world that seriously affect the peace.
When we solve these problems I have no doubt but what there will be others that arise that have been in existence for centuries.
It is going to be the course of this Government to do everything that we can to resolve these differences peacefully, even though they are not of our own making.
There are few of these situations which have been brought about by anything that we have done, but they are age-old differences that have existed for centuries.
I am an optimist.
I spent 35 days in meetings with the Security Council in the Cuban missile crisis.
I saw the alternatives presented there.
I realized that we can, with the great power we have, perhaps destroy 100 million people in a matter of minutes, and our adversaries can do likewise.
I do not think that the people of the world want that to happen and I think we are going to do everything that we can to avoid its happening.
Now there are going to be some very serious problems that we have to resolve before we achieve peace in the world, if we achieve it completely, but we are going to continue to try to resolve them.
I am encouraged and I am not pessimistic about the future.
I believe that we have adequate machinery to deal with these problems and I sincerely and genuinely believe that the people of the world want peace more than they want anything else and that, in time, through their leaders, someway, somehow we will find the answer.
Well, I have been reasonably close to the Presidency during the 30 years that I have been in Washington, particularly the last 3 years.
But I have gotten many different impressions in the last hundred days than I had before I came to this awesome responsibility.
I am deeply impressed by the spirit of unity in this country, by the many people of all faiths and all sections who closed ranks and were anxious to unite the country following the tragic affair of last November.
I am quite pleased with the manner in which the executive personnel has carried on following the death of their great leader, how the Cabinet has functioned to a man in this crisis.
I think the continuity and the transition and the organization of the budget and the various messages, and the outline of the program has created confidence in the country and in the world.
I am pleased with what the Congress has done in the field of passing 10 of the 15 appropriations bills in the first hundred days, that were carried over from last year, and in passing the education bills that made this Congress known as the greatest education Congress in the history of our land; in the passage of the civil rights bill in the House of Representatives after it had been considered there for some 6 or 7 months; in the passage of the tax bill in the United States Senate after it had been there almost 13 months, and now finally enacted into law.
While I have been lavishly praised by some, and I think lavishly criticized by some, I think generally speaking the American Nation has conducted itself as you would expect it to in a crisis and would get very good grades.
Insofar as I am concerned I am rather pleased with what has been accomplished in the first hundred days as a result of men and women of good will working together.
Well, I have not been nominated yet.
I think we will have plenty of time to decide that one after the convention.
I will cross that bridge when I come to it.
We are very interested in that conference.
We are going to participate in it and make every contribution we can.
We think it is essential in the interest of the peoples of the world that trade barriers be pulled down.
And we are going to contribute everything we can to that end.
I did not get the first part of your question.
No, I have not speculated on whether I will run or even who I will run against if I do run.
That is a matter for the conventions of the two parties to determine when the delegates are properly chosen and they act.
All I know about who may be interested in the job is from what I see in the papers, and the activities of the various individuals.
We are deeply concerned with it.
We think it is a very serious situation.
We sent our Under Secretary, the very able George Ball, across the water to talk to the people in Cyprus, and the people in Turkey and the people in Greece and the 'people in Great Britain and the guarantor powers.
We felt that we should make every possible effort to resolve these differences and to avoid more serious consequences.
The matter is now pending in the United Nations, and we are doing our dead-level best to find the solution.
We are concerned as it is extremely serious, but we believe that it will be resolved and we certainly hope so.
Yesterday, just before lunch, I was informed that the Commerce Department was giving consideration to adding lard to that list.
Rumors had been circulating in the trade for a few hours that it was expected that there would be a huge sale of lard involved, and my judgment was requested.
I concurred in the judgment of the Commerce Department that before a license was issued we should carefully consider what we were doing, and that if the rumors were true, the matter needed further attention.
Now we have no evidence that these rumors are going to develop into facts, but if they do, the Commerce Department will judicially examine all the facts and make a determination that justifies our Government acting in our national interests.
Now what action it will take will be determined after the case is heard, if the rumors and speculation seem to be true.
I think the President has a responsibility to do the very best job he can as President for all the people.
I think in order to do that it is important for the people to know the problems that confront him.
Man's judgment on any given question is no better than the facts he has on that question.
So I go along with the view expressed by Jefferson, that the collective judgment of the many is much to be preferred to the selective decisions of the few.
I shall have my Press Secretary hold daily briefings, at least two a day, and make available all information that can be made available to the press.
From time to time I will see individual members of the press about press business, and I may see some of my full-time friends socially, occasionally, I hope without too much criticism.
Other times I will have them in my office, if I have any announcements that I think worthy of their attention and taking their time.
At other times I will have a meeting like this to reach the folks who the press may not be able to reach through the ordinary newspaper or magazine media so that we can have radio coverage and television coverage.
I know of nothing in the President's job that is more important than being held accountable to the people, explaining to the people the reasons for his action, and telling the people something about the problems that confront him, because they are a very understanding group once they have the facts.
I have never discussed this with anyone and I would suspect that those rumors which you talk about, which I have read about, are strictly Republican in origin.
I will say that the civil rights bill which passed the House is the bill that this administration recommends.
I am in favor of it passing the Senate exactly in its present form.
I realize there will be some Senators who will want to strengthen it, some who will want to weaken it.
But so far as this administration is concerned, its position is firm and we stand on the House bill.
The speculation on Viet-Nam has been going on for some time.
I was out there in 1961.
There was a good deal of speculation then.
In my California speech I intended to say just what I did, that aggressors who intend to envelop peaceful, liberty-loving, free people, and attempt to do so through aggressive means, are playing a very dangerous game.
That is what I said, that is what I meant, and that is a very dangerous situation there and has been for some time.
We know that we have very serious problems in that area.
We want to have the very best people that we can handling those problems.
As I told you, on.
the ground in Viet-Nam we have Ambassador Lodge.
He has been sent additional assistance since I took office in November, and there are several new and very highly competent faces that have gone out at his request and with his approval.
Hilsman felt that he should return to his faculty duties and he submitted his resignation to us.
We had a reasonable time to select his successor.
We reviewed the several possible persons to succeed him.
We felt  Hilsman was a very able and a very conscientious and very effective public servant, and we realized it was difficult to fill his shoes.
We finally concluded, after conferring with Secretary Rusk at some length, that we should ask Secretary McNamara if he would be willing to let  Bundy resign his place under his administration and move over to the State Department to take over  Hilsman's duties.
Thorough consideration was given to it and  McNamara reluctantly agreed, but did agree and we have been able to prevail upon  Bundy to do that.
We think that he is the best possible successor that we could have to  Hilsman, and we do think that this whole area needs every bit of the best manpower that it can get.
Thank you,  President.
I take pleasure this morning in announcing my intention of nominating  William P.
Bundy as the Assistant Secretary of State for far Eastern Affairs.
Bundy, currently the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, will bring to his new post great background and experience in the far Eastern field.
Bundy will be replaced in the Defense Department post by  John McNaughton, the current General Counsel at the Department of Defense.
I also wish to announce the appointment of  Daniel M.
Luevano, of California, as Assistant Secretary of the Army.
Luevano is the Chief Deputy Director of the State Department of finance in California, under Governor Brown, and has consistently demonstrated his ability in a number of governmental posts in his native State, having formerly been assistant to  Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California.
I would also like to announce the appointment of  Frankie Muse freeman, Associate General Counsel of the  Louis Housing and Land Clearance Authority, as a new member of the Civil Rights Commission.
freeman is a former Assistant Attorney General of the State of Missouri, and distinguished Missouri lawyer.

In my California speech I intended to say just what I did, that aggressors who intend to envelop peaceful, liberty-loving, free people, and attempt to do so through aggressive means, are playing a very dangerous game.
That is what I said, that is what I meant, and that is a very dangerous situation there and has been for some time.
We know that we have very serious problems in that area.
We want to have the very best people that we can handling those problems.
As I told you, on.
the ground in Viet-Nam we have Ambassador Lodge.
He has been sent additional assistance since I took office in November, and there are several new and very highly competent faces that have gone out at his request and with his approval.
Hilsman felt that he should return to his faculty duties and he submitted his resignation to us.
We had a reasonable time to select his successor.
We reviewed the several possible persons to succeed him.
We felt  Hilsman was a very able and a very conscientious and very effective public servant, and we realized it was difficult to fill his shoes.
We finally concluded, after conferring with Secretary Rusk at some length, that we should ask Secretary McNamara if he would be willing to let  Bundy resign his place under his administration and move over to the State Department to take over  Hilsman's duties.
Thorough consideration was given to it and  McNamara reluctantly agreed, but did agree and we have been able to prevail upon  Bundy to do that.
We think that he is the best possible successor that we could have to  Hilsman, and we do think that this whole area needs every bit of the best manpower that it can get.
Thank you,  President.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
President Truman and  Johnson will go as my personal representatives to the funeral of King Paul.
In addition, other members of the delegation will include Archbishop Iakovos;  John Plumides, President of the American-Hellenic fraternal organization; Judge John Pappas of Boston; Congressman John Brademas of Indiana;  Mike Manatos, my Special Assistant; and  George Vournas of Washington, D.
CI am today reappointing  Walter Tobriner to the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners.
Tobriner has had a distinguished record of service in the community and while I understand his desire to return to private pursuits, I am very pleased that he has agreed to continue as Commissioner.
I am today reappointing Laurence K.
Walrath as a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
This will be for a new 7-year term.
Commissioner Walrath is currently the Chairman of the Commission and, we think, has done an excellent job as a member.
I am today appointing  James L.
Robertson to a full 14-year term on the Federal Reserve Board.
Robertson has served with distinction on this Board, having been appointed to serve out an unexpired term.
I am today appointing  Hugh Owens to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Owens is a prominent lawyer in Oklahoma City, and currently the head of the Oklahoma Securities Commission.
I am happy to announce that  Frank Stanton, President of the Columbia Broadcasting System, has agreed to serve as Chairman of the U.
S.
Advisory Commission on Information.
I have a brief statement on the economy.
I am very pleased by early action to the tax cut and to the outlook for the economy in general.
Mail to the White House has been running about 10 to 1 in support of the tax cut.
I have a wire that I would like to read you as an example of some of the many hundreds of communications we have received since our last statement on this subject.
I am spending my first weeks increase in salary just to express sincere appreciation to you and your administration for a much needed relief on the American taxpayer.
I am sure millions of others feel the same way.
The Department of Labor's report on unemployment yesterday was quite encouraging.
Both total employment and the labor force are up more than seasonal.
This is the buoyancy of the tax cut, the expectation effect, and I think it is making itself felt.
The unemployment rate dropped in February to the lowest level since 1962, and as low a level as at any time in this expansion period.
New figures on business intentions to invest in plant and equipment will be released this week.
They will confirm a very solid increase.
Those figures will be released Tuesday and I cannot comment beyond the fact that they confirm rising business optimism and I think will be more than twice the amount of the increase of last year.
The price news continues to be reassuring.
The Dow Jones Index of industrial stocks was 711 on November 22, and it was 806 yesterday.
The previous numbers given were composites of all stocks and the increase in value of those stocks was approximately $45 billion.
The revised Consumers Price Index last week was well paved in Januaryonly one-tenth of a percent above December.
Weekly indicators suggest that wholesale prices may have declined a bit in February.
Businessmen have healthy vestment intentions but do not seem to be expecting overheating on the price side.
A survey of the National Association of Purchasing Agents last month shows a smaller percentage, only 21 percent, expecting price increases than in the preceding 5 months.
This good price news is no reason to relax our vigilance on this front.
I think I should say that I have accepted the invitation of the three national television networks to appear in an informal conversation with the President, reviewing the first too days of the administration, next Sunday, March 15.
The program will be taped in my office, on Saturday afternoon.
The format and the ground rules will be similar to those set up by President Kennedy's conversation with the networks in 1962, and his projected conversation with them in 1963.
The networks will announce the time they will show the program on Monday, March 9'Here is an up-to-date report of women in Government, since January: Twenty-nine women have been appointed to Presidential positions.
Twenty-two new appointments have been made in the professional level from GS-12 in excess of $10,000 through GS-18, to $20,000 One hundred and sixty-two promotions have been made in the professional grades from GS-12 through GS-18.
I have a brief announcement on the Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke.
The leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease, cancer, and stroke.
They have a greater impact than all other major causes of death in this country.
Fifteen million Americans are today suffering from these diseases.
Twenty-three million days of work are lost every year because of them.
Two-thirds of all Americans now living will ultimately suffer or die from one of these diseases.
I have therefore asked the distinguished panel of laymen and doctors to recommend steps that can be taken to reduce the burden and incidence of these diseases.
This panel will be chaired by  Michael E.
DeBakey of Baylor University College of Medicine in Houston, Tex.
Five of these members are women.
Also on the panel are  Barry Bingham, Marion Folsom, Emerson Foote,  Howard Rusk,  Paul Sanger,  Edward Dempsey,  Hugh Hussey,  Irving S.
Wright,  J.
Willis Hurst,  Charles W.
Mayo,  Sidney Farber,  R.
Lee Clark,  E.
M.
Papper,  Philip Handler,  Florence Mahoney,  Harry Truman,  Samuel Bellet,  John Meyer,  Marion Fay,  Helen Taussig,  Jane Wright,  John Carter,  Frank Horsfall, , Gen.
Alfred Gruenther,  Arthur Hanisch,  James F.
Oates, , and Gen.
David Sarnoff.
I have today signed an Executive order creating the Committee for the Preservation of the White House to be made of seven public members and six official members.
We have created this committee to assure the American people and those who have worked so hard to make the White House a living testament to the history of our country that this work will continue.
As you are aware, the principal moving force in this work in the past few years has been  John F.
Kennedy, under whose guidance and leadership this important White House project has been carried out.
I am happy to report that at the invitation of  Johnson,  Kennedy has agreed to serve as one of the seven public members so that her continued advice and counsel will be available to us.
The other members of this committee will be  Henry Du Pont,  James Fosburgh,  George Brown,  William Benton,  Marshall Field, and  Bruce Catton.
The members of the Fine Arts, Painting, and Advisory Committees on the Restoration of the White House have been asked to continue in an advisory capacity to the new Committee for the Preservation of the White House.
The Executive order and full information on the membership will be available immediately after this press conference, if you care to have the biographies.
I have accepted an invitation from the Council of the Organization of American States to make an address to them on March 16th concerning the installation of the new Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress The Committee's Chairman is a distinguished Colombian,  Carlos Sanz de Santamaria, and he had I have already talked about the importance of his Committee's work.
In those same days I look forward to meeting with all of the United States ambassadors and all of the AID directors to the Latin American nations, who will be here in Washington for a 3-day conference.
My commitment to the Alliance for Progress is complete, and it also enjoys strong support from the Congress.
So we will be working with our Ambassadors and AID directors to strengthen our efforts in this field.
I will notify the Congress on Monday that I have established new employment ceilings for most Federal agencies well below those contained in my 1965 budget estimate.
These reductions will cut total Federal civilian employment by 6,526 below the budget estimate for the current fiscal year, and 7,265 below the estimate for the fiscal year July 1.
These and other economies will allow me to reduce my 1965 budget estimate by nearly $42 million.
These reductions come as a result of the cost-cutting programs which I asked each agency head to put into effect last November and December.
The results represent some progress in our drive to raise the efficiency of the Federal Government and to cut the cost.
Details will be available from  Salinger.
Today I have a report on the first results of our efforts to reduce the cost of Government publications.
With only a few agencies reporting, with the bulk of the work yet to be done over the next several months, it is gratifying to note that already we have eliminated 158 existing or proposed publications for savings of more than $1 million to the taxpayers.
I will be glad to take any questions.
We would be very happy to explore that possibility with them.
We have already concluded a wheat sale to them, and if they need additional wheat or anything else we have, we would be glad to discuss it with the appropriate officials at the appropriate time.
I know of few things that the Soviet Union has that we are in need of, but it is a matter that we would be glad to pursue.
I think that that is a proper subject for the people to pass upon.
I think that that is one of the reasons we have primaries, to ascertain the sentiment of the public.
We are going to have a very interesting report from New Hampshire in the next few days, and I am looking forward to hearing it.
I do not know that the other States will necessarily be guided by what the judgment of the New Hampshire people will be, but it will be interesting.
That is a matter that is being studied by the Senate committee at this time.
I would not make such a recommendation.
I think the Senate committee will hear from all who are interested in the subject, and after due deliberations make their recommendations.
A constitutional amendment would not be something the President would pass upon.
I have individual views on it, but at this time I think it is a matter that more appropriately should be considered by the subcommittee that is considering constitutional amendments.
No, Secretary McNamara will no doubt have some observations to make on that question when he returns to this country, but no decision has yet been made.
I would rate all the people who have been mentioned for Vice President as very high.
I think they are all leading Democrats, all good citizens, and as the Attorney General has, have established a very fine record of public service.
As I have stated on numerous occasions before, I think this is a matter that will be determined after the President has been nominated, and after his recommendations have been sought, and after the delegates have voted.
Yes.
I think we passed a good civil rights bill in the House.
I hope that same bill will be passed in the Senate.
I believe the Senate is prepared now to diligently apply itself, and I hope it stays on the subject until a bill is passed that is acceptable.
No, I said in response to that question that the people have a right to express themselves, and primaries are for that purpose; that I expect the Vice President will be selected after the President has been nominated, and after his suggestions and recommendations have been sought, and the delegates then will make the decision in their own wisdom.
As expressed before, in the question asked by  Thomas, I think that we will be glad to explore any suggestions made to us, and if there is anything that we have that other people need, we will give consideration to selling it.
If there is anything that they have that we need to buy, we would explore the desirability of doing so.
Yes, I have been in communication with General de Gaulle.
I have met with General de Gaulle on two occasions since I became President.
I met with him before I became President.
Our Ambassador is on his way home now to make a full report on his observations on conditions in France.
I would be very happy to meet General de Gaulle any time that it can be appropriately arranged, satisfactory to both persons, and if there is anything at all that can be worked out.
We hope the French Governmentwe wish it well.
We want to see it as strong in the world as possible.
We want to believe that there are no irreconcilable differences between us, and we believe when the chips are down we will all be together.
I think that the leadership can best assess that.
I would not want to estimate.
I do not think anyone really knows how long the matter will be discussed, but I believe that there are Senators who feel very strongly, both pro and con, and they will be given adequate opportunity to express themselves.
Then I believe the majority of the Senate will have an opportunity to work its will.
I am not aware of anything that we are hiding.
I do not want to get into any debates on the basis of partisanship or membership in any party.
We have had the problem of Viet-Nam for some time, in both administrations.
I worked very closely with President Eisenhower when he was here, in connection with that problem.
And I expect both Republicans and Democrats to work with this administration in attempting to help us do what is best for our country.
I have heard nothing from the Ambassador about any intention to leave.
I have every reason to believe that if he had any plans, he would make them known.
I fully covered, in my conference last week, my views toward the Ambassador's service, and I believe when and if he has any plans to leave the State Department service, he will communicate them to me.
I think that we are in adequate communication with each other.
I would be very happy to see the Chairman when it is indicated that there are any things that we can explore that would be helpful.
I know of no reason for such a meeting at this time.
The answer is No to both of your questions.
I do not think that the report has been made a Government report as yet.
I understand this committee was appointed by the Surgeon General with the understanding that when they made their recommendations, that report would be submitted to all the departments of Government concerned, and that would be the second procedure followed.
They, in turn, would carefully digest and study its recommendations and then make the recommendations back to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The Government agencies concerned are now making that study and in due time will make their recommendations.
No.
I am aware of no detailed plan that General de Gaulle has concerning Southeast Asia.
Our Government has discussed with representatives of his government certain phases of that situation, but so far as I am personally aware I know of no specific detailed plan that the General may have advanced.
I think that explains itself.
We have taken about $3 billion out of the budget as constituted last year, 98.
We reduced that budget by about $3 billion, by cutting $1,100 million out of Defense, almost $r billion out of Agriculture, and almost $100 million out of the Post Office, 150 out of Atomic Energy, and so forth.
We reduced it $3 billion.
Now we thought that all of those reductions could be made.
They had appropriations for them last year.
We are not asking for appropriations for them this year.
So we will save $3 billion there.
But we are asking for an additional $2 billion to be put in the budget.
Roughly, that is $400 million extra interest rate on the public debt, $600 million for space.
That is a billion.
Then we have the poverty program and the Appalachia program, roughly a half-million dollars, $300 million extra for education, 75 for urban renewal, 75 for public housing, and we expect those programs to have money this year taken from those programs that we did not ask for money that they had last year.
We expect the total budget to be a little less than a billion dollars less than the Kennedy budget of last year.
Now that is possible, we think, because $17 billion was spent on Defense needs during the 3 years of the Kennedy administration that we do not think is essential today.
While the population has been increasing between 2 and 3 percent, our budget has been increasing approximately 5 percent or $5 billion per year.
This year, instead of it increasing $5 billion, it is going to be reduced $1 billion.
This year, instead of our deficit being $10 billion, it is going to be less than $5 billion.
That means that this year, our deficit will be reduced by more than 5&deg; percent.
We have a provision in our budget for contingencies, for any possible supplementals.
We hope that that will not be necessary, but we have provided for it.
We are determined, and this administration is dedicated to see to it, that we live within the budget sent to Congress.
As I told you now, we will have another quarterly report April 10th, and we hope we can further reduce budget ceilings at that time.
I have not studied General Eisenhower's proposals or suggestions.
That is a matter that would involve a constitutional amendment.
The President is not called upon to approve constitutional amendments.
That is now pending in a Senate subcommittee.
I think that they can be trusted to hear all the evidence and come to any conclusions that they think desirable.
I have stated my views just now.
I do not agree with Senator Goldwater.
I think that we will have to wait until next November to see what happens at the polls.
But I am very happy with the polls at the present time.
I have no such recommendations at this time.
I do not think that the American public has fully understood the reason for our withdrawing any advisers from South Viet-Nam, and I think they should.
We have called back approximately 1,000 people.
A good many of those people, several hundred, were there training guards, policemen.
Once those people were trained, we felt that they could act as policemen as well as our people could act.
So, we withdrew those people.
From time to time, as our training mission is completed, other people will be withdrawn.
From time to time, as additional advisers are needed, or as people to train additional Vietnamese are needed, we will send them out there.
But we see no reason to keep the companies of MP's out there, after they have already trained the Vietnamese who can perform the duty equally as well.
I think that a good deal will depend on what Secretary McNamara advises concerning who is withdrawn, when they are withdrawn, and who is sent out, and when they are sent out.
The Secretary, with General Taylor, and a very able staff, are there now, carefully studying the question and will be there almost a week.
When his report is in, we will carefully evaluate it, and if additional men are needed, we will send them.
If others have completed their mission, we will withdraw them.
But because we withdraw some MP's from Saigon who have trained people to take their place, there is no indication that we are not still just as interested in South Viet-Nam as we have always been.
We are hoping that that will not be necessary.
We believe it is unlikely.
We cannot speak for the investment community, but we have hopes that we cannot materially increase our interest rates.
We think that to do so might offset some of the advantages that have come from the tax bill, and we hope that capital will be available in ample quantities, at reasonable interest rates, to see new investment take place and new facilities built that will employ additional people.
I am terribly sorry, but I did not hear your question.
Would you please speak louder? I will not go further than what I have said in the formal announcement.
When the Committee meets and formalizes, I am sure that information will be available to you.
But I do not think I should go any further today than I have gone.
President, thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have come before you today for a regular, scheduled, televised, notified well in advance press conference.
I did not drive myself over here.
But I did have to cancel an informal meeting with some tourists at the gate.
I am happy to see here today so many visiting members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, so many of my old friends.
You are welcome to your city.
I have some information on the state of our national economy.
In the first quarter of 1964 our gross national product rose to a rate of $608 ? billion.
This is up $8? billion from the fourth quarter of 1963.
The first quarter gross national product is nearly $37 billion above the year earlier figure.
It is the largest year-to-year gain, I am told by the Chairman of the Economic Council this afternoon, in more than 2 years.
Personal income in March ran at a rate of $480? billion, an increase of $1? billion over February and $25.
7 billion over the rate of March 1963.
for the first time in 2 years we are making real progress in cutting down unemployment.
We had a net gain of 1 1/2 million jobs from a year ago.
The jobless rate dropped from 5.
8 percent to 5.
4 percent, and some other facts I think are worthy of note.
Labor has gained over 4 million jobs, nonfarm jobs, in a 3-year period, and over $56 billion of added annual income.
Business has gained a 50 percent advance in profits after taxes.
Moreover, these wage and profit gains have not been eaten away by inflation.
Prices in the United States have been more stable than in any other industrial country in the world.
With strong markets, with steady costs, with lower taxes, American business does not need higher price levels to assure continued growth and profits.
I look, therefore, to responsible business and to responsible labor to help us maintain our very fine record of cost and price stability, and help us go all the way to full employment and a balanced budget, and a strong enough competitive position to wipe out the balance of payments deficits.
I believe the accurate picture of what is happening in the railroad strike negotiations has been presented fully and completely, but this may interest you.
I do want to stress my deep and earnest hope that these negotiations will strengthen the collective bargaining processes in our country.
To me it is vitally important that we preserve our free enterprise system.
free enterprise assumes a capacity of both labor and management to handle their own affairs and to settle differences by negotiations.
I do not think that we serve the cause of free enterprise by precipitating situations which could lead to a breakdown of this process.
The public interest must and will be served.
I think it is in the public interest to proceed by negotiation wherever possible.
Intensive negotiationday and night negotiationis now going on, assisted by the mediators who are experienced men that I have appointed and who have come here at great sacrifice.
It is a genuine collective bargaining in the true sense of the word, and I have great faith in the capacity of true collective bargaining.
There have been fewer strikes since January 1961 than in any other 3-year period since the early thirties.
There have been fewer workers involved in strikes in the period since January 1961 than during any comparable 3-year period since the early thirties.
There have been fewer man-days lost because of strikes since 1961 than in any comparable 3-year period since World War II There were more strikes and more people involved in them during the World War II period, but they were settled, as you know, much more quickly, which meant fewer man-days were lost.
I am today establishing a program of Presidential Scholars.
The title will be given to outstanding scholars graduating from our secondary schools, public and private, throughout the Nation.
These awards are to recognize the most precious resource of the United Statesthe brain power of its young peopleto encourage the pursuit of intellectual attainments among all our youth.
It is my hope that in the future a similar system can be worked out to honor our most gifted young people in the creative arts.
Two Presidential Scholars, a boy and a girl, will be named from each State.
Two will be named from Puerto Rico, two from the District of Columbia, two from the American Territories, and up to 15 at large.
The Presidential Scholars will be chosen by a Commission on Presidential Scholars, which consists of  Milton Eisenhower, president of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the Commission; Leonard Bernstein; Katherine Anne Porter;  Albert W.
Dent, president of Dillard University of New Orleans; the Reverend Michael P.
Walsh, president of Boston College;  William Hagerty, president of Drexel Institute of Technology, Philadelphia; and  Melvin W.
Barnes, the superintendent of schools of Portland, Oreg.
The Commission will operate with complete independence.
The Presidential Scholars will be named in May of this year.
The President will invite them to the White House as guests of this Nation, and present each with a medallion symbolizing the honor.
On March 30th, the Senate passed a bill which would authorize and investigate and study the possible construction of a sea level canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
This bill has been referred to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and fisheries.
This administration supports this bill and hopes that the House committee will give early and favorable consideration to it.
There are several alternative routes for such a canal, which will have to be studied carefully before a decision can be made.
As part of the necessary studies, the United States and the Government of Colombia have already reached an agreement to conduct studies relative to a survey for a sea level canal.
We are just able to announce this agreement today.
We hope to make similar arrangements with other countries later.
I have instructed the Secretary of Defense to immediately dispatch a survey team to Colombia to explore the possibility of constructing a sea-level canal in that country.
The Secretary of Defense has informed me that a 10-man team will leave for Colombia tomorrow morning to begin work immediately.
The United States team will work in close collaboration with the team of the Colombian Government.
I am very pleased to announce the appointment of  Roger Stevens of New York as my assistant to advise me on the arts.
To assist  Stevens and to provide a forum for the representation of all the arts of the United States, I shall shortly issue an Executive order establishing a Presidential Board on the Arts.
I have invited Prime Minister Krag of Denmark, and  Krag, to visit Washington on June 9th.
Johnson and I visited them last year.
The Prime Minister has accepted the invitation, and he and  Krag will be coming to Washington following their participation in Denmark Day at the New York World's fair.
I am looking forward to seeing two of my old friends from Germany this summer.
The Governing Mayor of Berlin, Willy Brandt, will be here on May 18th.
The federal Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard, who was here earlier in the year, will come back on June 12th.
I will be glad to have any questions.
I think that we have a civil rights bill pending in the Senate that has passed the House.
It is very important that bill be passed at the earliest possible date.
I think passage of that bill will be helpful in this general situation.
We do not, of course, condone violence or taking the law into your own hands, or threatening the health or safety of our people.
You really do the civil rights cause no good when you go to this extent, but we are hopeful that all Americans understand that we are going to pass the civil rights bill because it is morally right, and because we feel that these people have too long been denied their rights.
On the other hand, we do not think the violation of one right or the denial of one right should permit the violation of another right.
Yes.
I am pleased with our strength.
I think we have made great gains during the last 3 years.
When you realize that each year during the last 3 years we have spent approximately $6 billion more on our military budget than was spent the last year of the Eisenhower administration, when you realize that we are spending $8 billion more this year than was spent the last year of the Eisenhower administration on our military budget, you realize that approximately $25 billion more has been spent than would have been spent if we had gone on at the rate of the last year of the Republican administration.
For that expenditure of $25 billion we have achieved extra combat divisions, extra nuclear warheads, extra missile strength.
I am pleased with those accomplishments.
Under the law the Secretary of Defense,  McNamara, is charged with the leadership and the direction of the Defense Department.
While he operates a tight budget, I think he operates an adequate one.
I think his work has been constructive.
I have confidence in him.
The Congress has confidence in him.
I believe the American people have confidence in him.
You can depend on what he tells you.
No, I do not anticipate another major development at this time.
I am encouraged by the fact that there are approaches being made to purchase some things from our country, and the foreign Relations Committee of the Senate is now having hearings and giving study to the possibilities of increasing East-West trade.
But so far as anticipating just the extent of that trade and in what lines it will be, I am not able to say.
I think that this is a matter that the mediators and the negotiators representing each side will attempt to evolve and find an agreeable ground and a common solution.
I am not an overly optimistic man, but I do believe that under our collective bargaining system, a result can be reached.
I hope and pray that it will be by the end of the week.
No.
I hope that they feel in November as they do in April.
Of course, we would have preferred the decision to be unanimous and we would have liked for our friend and ally, France, to have seen the situation as did the other seven members of SEATO We are very pleased, however, that seven of us saw things alike.
We have a definite policy in Viet-Nam.
You know what that policy is.
We think it is the best policy that could be derived from the alternatives open to us and we are very pleased and happy that Secretary Rusk found that at least seven signatories of SEATO were willing to go along with us.
Well, I did not do a great deal of anticipating prior to November on just how difficult the task would be, but I enjoy it.
There is a lot of work connected with it.
Nearly everyone is anxious to help you do that job.
Most people are hoping and praying that you do a good job.
And a very few people I have called on that have not been willing to put their shoulder to the wheel and help me.
It is probably more difficult than I expected it would be, but I am enjoying it and I am prepared to continue.
Well, first, I do not have any interest in Government-regulated industries of any kind, and never have had.
I own no stocks.
I own a little ranch land, something in excess of 2,000 acres.
The Commission has made no request of me or of my family for anything.
We are perfectly willing to comply, I am sure the trustees would be, with any request that they did make.
There is not anything that we have to secrete in any manner, shape, or form.
Johnson inherited some property, invested that property in the profession of her choice, and worked at it with pleasure and satisfaction until I forced her to leave it when I assumed the Presidency.
As you know, and I want all to know, all of that stock has been placed in trust, as has been the practice with other Presidents, and although I own none of it,  Johnson has placed it in trust, an irrevocable trust that canthe property can be disposed of, it can be leased, it can be sold, at any time.
Any of those decisions would still require the action of the Commission.
Even if you tried to sell it, you would have to have their approval.
But I see no conflict in any way.
She participates in no decisions the company makes.
It is entirely with the trustees.
In any event, if she did participate, the President would not have anything to do with it.
I think it is always desirable for anyone to acquire as much knowledge of languages as possible.
I have not given any study to the particular suggestion you make.
It seems to be a good one, and I will have it explored.
At the moment, I would not make a judgment because that decision will likely come to me in the near future.
When the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented their military recommendations to me at the early part of the year, they were together on all of the recommendations with the exception that General LeMay asked for the privilege of taking funds already calculated in his budget and using them to study plans for a new bomber.
I told him I would give consideration to his proposal.
I understand that proposal has been formulated and is now going through channels, and will shortly come to the President.
When it gets to me, I will study it as best I can and make the decision that I think is in the national interest.
I would think that is a very accurate appraisal of it, and I would think it will be a hard fight, a difficult one.
I would hope that it would not be too close, but it may be.
I do not think that you can ever tell this far in advance how people are going to decide the choice, but I have no doubt but what it will be a hard and long fight.
Yes.
I would counsel moderation to all groups, and understanding of their fellowman and trying to appreciate his position.
I think if people would put themselves in the other fellow's position, they will all be a little more tolerant of the other man's viewpoint.
There are people who feel very strongly on both sides of this issue.
I found that in the 1957 bill.
I found it in the bill in 1960.
It took us many days and nights to try to find an area of agreement that the Members of Congress and the President would accept.
I expect that there will be many days ahead when strong forces on both sides will be appealing to people to side with them.
I only hope that we recognize that it has been a hundred years since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves of their chains, but he has not freed all of the people of the bigotry that exists.
It has been a hundred years since President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but a great many people do not have equal rights as of now.
While emancipation may be a proclamation, it is not a fact until education is blind to color, until employment is unaware of race.
As long as those conditions exist in the country, we are going to have protests and we are entitled to protest and petition under our constitutional rights.
I hope, though, that the Congress will act promptly with reasonable dispatch to bring those protests and bring those petitions and bring these disturbances from the streets and the alleys into the courts where they belong.
In order to do that, we need a good civil rights bill, and the bill now pending in the Senate is a good bill.
I hope it can be passed in a reasonable time.
Well, that would take more time than I have, but there are some that we are vitally interested in.
I have just named one, the civil rights bill, that is pending in the Senate.
We had difficulty in the House Judiciary Committee.
It spent a long time there.
Then the House Rules Committee.
We filed a petition, and a good many Members signed that, to discharge the bill and finally the Rules Committee passed it.
It is now in the Senate, and it has been debated a good while there.
So that is a very important piece of legislation for the national welfare, because we are going to have many problems, even after it is passed, adjusting to it.
We ought to get it passed as early as we can so that before school begins next year we will have this law on the books and we can move ahead.
I think it is as important that we pass the food stamp plan in the Senate as the civil rights bill.
We passed it in the House by a good vote the other day.
It is very important, not only to the consumers of this country, but to the producers of this country and to the business people of this country.
It is a good piece of legislation.
It is soundly conceived.
I hope that we can get action in the Agriculture Committee of the Senate in a short time.
Perhaps as soon as the civil rights bill is out of the way we can pass the food stamp bill.
The pay bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to continued good Government in this country.
I have on my desk today a number of resignations from some of the very best men in Government who tell me that they just cannot stay any longer.
They have been here 3 years, and they cannot stay any longer at their present salaries.
One man said he had had to borrow $16,000, another one said he had had to borrow 19,000, another one $6,000.
And they just did not feel they could go on doing that if the pay bill was not going to be passed.
I think that we are going to lose some of the best men in the Government.
Like sergeants that run the Army, some of the Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries and the men who do not get the notoriety but do the hard work from day to dayare entitled to a raise.
I hope the Congress will consider the bill in both committeesalthough they have taken one vote on it in the Housethat they can make some adjustments to meet the objections of the Members and pass the pay bill.
I think the Medicare bill is an extremely important bill that will provide medical care for our old people, aged people, under social security.
I believe that we are close to having enough votes to report that bill from the committee.
If we can make adjustments and modifications to get that bill reported and passed and have medicare under social security, it would be a great day for the people of our country.
Nearly every home has some father or mother, or uncle or aunt, or some member of their family that finds need for medical care insurance.
Too many of them do not have it, and never will have it under the present system we have.
I think the poverty bill is very important.
All the Cabinet Members have testified on itSecretary McNamara, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Agriculture.
We are all united.
We think that it is a comprehensive bill and has very sound principles.
It will do a lot to help us with our juvenile delinquency problem.
It will take our boys off the streets and out of the alleys and out of the pool rooms.
It will make it possible for us to train and educate people for national service that are now being turned back by the draft.
We think that bill is soundly conceived and very important.
So I would list just those four or fivethe pay bill, the poverty bill, the Medicare bill, the civil rights bill, the food stamp billas five I should hope would be passed before the convention.
I raised that question with the Pentagon today at lunch, and they tell me they are unaware of any of the material relating to General MacArthur that had not already been published in books prior to the recent revelation.
Yes, I would always be concerned about any elector that was not committed to vote for me, if I were a candidate.
And I would do my best to convince him of the error of his ways.
I do not anticipate, however, that there will be any substantial number that will feel that the future of this country should be placed in the hands of independent electors, but I think most of them will be associated with one of the two regular parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
I gave serious consideration to what my policies should be in connection with primaries many years ago.
Generally speaking, there could be an exception, but generally speaking, I think it is unwise for me to interfere in primaries or attempt to influence people in primaries.
In connection with the presidential primaries this year, which is much more specific than my previous statement, which applies to all primaries, I gave thought to what my course of conduct should be, and concluded that I would not enter any primaries.
I would do the very best job I could as President for all the people up until convention time, and then let the delegates at the convention make their choice freely.
Then my conduct would be determined after they made their choice.
Thank you,  President.
Paul Miller and my fellow Americans: Last Friday I talked to the editors of the leading newspapers of this land and today I am honored to appear before their bosses.
This is the kind of a distinguished gathering that reminds me of a meeting in the Cabinet Room the other day.
Around that Cabinet table sat three Harvard men, two Yale men, Dean Rusk and three other Rhodes Scholars, and one graduate of the Southwest Texas State Teachers College.
It is good to be here in this great city that gave our Nation one of the great artists of repartee that we know as Al Smith.
Once Al Smith was making a speech in this city and a heckler yelled, Tell them all you know, Al.
It will not take long.
And Al, without any hesitation, answered, I will tell them all we both know and it will not take any longer.
Today I want to talk about something that we both know about.
To you serious and concerned men, who have gathered here at this luncheon, and ladies, I want to speak about the problems and the potentials that lie ahead and the great purpose to which you and I, and all Americans, must be dedicated.
The world has changed many times since General Washington counseled his new and weak country to observe good faith and justice toward all nations.
Great empires have risen and dissolved.
Great heroes have made their entrances and have left the stage.
And America has slowly, often reluctantly, grown to be a great power and a leading member of world society.
So we seek today, as we did in Washington's time, to protect the life of our Nation, to preserve the liberty of our citizens, and to pursue the happiness of our people.
This is the touchstone of our world policy.
Thus, we seek to add no territory to our dominion, no satellites to our orbit, no slavish followers to our policies.
The most impressive witness to this restraint is that for a century our own frontiers have stood quiet and stood unarmed.
But we have also learned in this century, and we have learned it at painful and bloody cost, that our own freedom depends upon the freedom of others, that our own protection requires that we help protect others, that we draw increased strength from the strength of others.
Thus, to allies we are the most dependable and enduring of friends, for our own safety depends upon the strength of that friendship.
To enemies we are the most steadfast and determined of foes, for we know that surrender anywhere threatens defeat everywhere.
for a generation, without regard to party or region or class, our country has been united in a basic foreign policy that grows from this inescapable teaching.
The principles of this foreign policy have been shaped in battle, have been tested in danger, have been sustained in achievement.
They have endured under four Presidents of the United States, because they reflect the realities of our world and they reflect the aims of our country.
Particular actions must change as events change conditions.
We must be alert to shifting realities, to emerging opportunities, and always alert to any fresh dangers.
But we must not mistake day-to-day changes for fundamental movements in the course of history.
It very often requires greater courage and resolution to maintain a policy which time has tested, than to change it in the face of the moment's pressures.
Our foreign policy rests on very tested principles.
First, since Korea, we have labored to build a military strength of unmatched might.
We have succeeded.
If the threat of war has lessened, it is largely because our opponents realize that attack would bring destruction.
This effort has been costly.
But the costs of weakness are far greater than the costs of strength, and the payment far more painful.
That is why, in the last 3 years, your Government has strengthened the whole range of America's defenses.
We have increased defense spending in these 3 years by approximately $6 billion a year over the last year of the Eisenhower administration, and this year we are spending approximately $8 billion more on defense than we were during that last year.
Second, we have strongly resisted Communist efforts to extend their dominion and successfully resisted efforts to expand their power.
We have taken the risks and we have used the power which this principle demanded.
We have avoided purposeless provocation and we have avoided needless adventure.
The Berlin airlift, the Korean war, the defense of Formosa, the Cuba crisis, the struggle in Viet-Nam, prove our determination to resist aggression and prove our ability to adapt particular response to particular challenge.
Third, we have worked for the revival of strength among our allies, initially, to oppose Communist encroachment on warweakened nations; in the long run, because our own future rests on the vitality and the unity of the Western society to which we belong.
Fourth, we have encouraged the independence and the progress of developing countries.
We are safer and we are more comfortable in a world where all people can govern themselves in their own way, and where all nations have the inner strength to resist external domination.
Fifth, we have pursued every hope of a lasting peace.
from the Baruch plan, named after that noble resident of this city, to the test ban treaty, we have sought and we have welcomed agreements which decrease danger without decreasing security.
In that pursuit, for 20 years we have been the leading power in the support of the United Nations.
In that pursuit, this year as in every year we will work to reach agreement on measures to reduce armament and lessen the chance of war.
Today we apply these same principles in a world that is much changed since 1945.
Europe seeks a new role for strength rather than contenting itself with protection for weakness.
The unity of communism is being eroded by the insistent forces of nationalism and diverging interest.
A whole new group of societies is painfully struggling toward the modern world.
Our basic principles are adequate to this shifting world.
But foreign policy is more than just a set of general principles.
It is the changing application of those principles to specific dangers and to specific opportunities.
It involves knowledge of strengths and awareness of limitations in each new situation.
The presence of offensive missiles in Cuba was a fact.
The presence of fallout in the atmosphere has been a fact.
The presence of guerrillas in Viet-Nam, at this hour, is a fact.
Such facts cannot be dealt with simply by historical judgments or general precepts.
They require concrete acts of courage, and wisdom, and often restraint.
These qualities of endurance and innovation, these qualities of continuity and change are at work in at least six major areas of continuing concern to you.
First, is our relationship with the Soviet Union, the center of our concern for peace.
Communists, using force and intrigue, seek to bring about a Communist-dominated world.
Our convictions, our interests, our life as a nation, demand that we resolutely oppose, with all of our might, that effort to dominate the world.
This, and this alone, is the cause of the cold war between us.
For the United States has nothing to fear from peaceful competition.
We welcome it and we will win it.
It is our system which flourishes and grows stronger in a world free from the threat of war.
And in such a competition all people, everywhere, will be the gainers.
Today, as we meet here, there are new pressures, new realities, which make it permissible to hope that the pursuit of peace is in the interests of the Soviet Union as it is in ours.
And our own restraint may be convincing the Soviet leaders of the reality that we, in America, seek neither war nor the destruction of the Soviet Union.
Thus I am very hopeful that we can take important steps toward the day when, in the words of the Old Testament, nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
We must remember that peace will not come suddenly.
It will not emerge dramatically from a single agreement or a single meeting.
It will be advanced by concrete and limited accommodations, by the gradual growth of common interests, by the increased awareness of shifting dangers and alignments, and by the development of trust in a good faith based on a reasoned view of the world.
Our own position is clear.
We will discuss any problem, we will listen to any proposal, we will pursue any agreement, we will take any action which might lessen the chance of war without sacrificing the interests of our allies or our own ability to defend the alliance against attack.
In other words, our guard is up, but our hand is out.
I am taking two actions today which reflect both our desire to reduce tension and our unwillingness to risk weakness.
I have ordered a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched uranium, to be carried out over a 4-year period.
When added to previous reductions, this will mean an overall decrease in the production of plutonium by 20 percent, and of enriched uranium by 4&deg; percent.
By bringing production in line with need, and the chart shows now that our production is here, and our need is here, and our reduction today will bring it here, we think we will reduce tension while we maintain all the necessary power.
We must not operate a WPA nuclear project, just to provide employment when our needs have been met.
And in reaching these decisions I have been in close consultation with Prime Minister Douglas-Home.
Simultaneously with my announcement now, Chairman Khrushchev is releasing a statement in Moscow, at 2 of the clock our time, in which he makes definite commitments to steps toward a more peaceful world.
He agrees to discontinue the construction of two big new atomic reactors for the production of plutonium over the next several years, to reduce substantially the production of U235 for nuclear weapons, and to allocate more fissionable material for peaceful uses.
This is not disarmament.
This is not a declaration of peace.
But it is a hopeful sign and it is a step forward which we welcome and which we can take in the hope that the world may yet, one day, live without the fear of war.
At the same time, I have reaffirmed all the safeguards against weakening our nuclear strength which we adopted at the time of the test ban treaty.
The second area of continuing effort is the development of Atlantic partnership with a stronger and a more unified Europe.
Having begun this policy when peril was great, we will not now abandon it as success moves closer.
We worked for a stronger and more prosperous Europe, and Europe is strong and prosperous today because of our work and beyond our expectation.
We have supported a close partnership with a more unified Europe and in the past 15 years more peaceful steps have been taken in this direction than have been taken at any time in our history.
The pursuit of this goal, like the pursuit of any large and worthy cause, will not be easy or will not be untroubled.
But the realities of the modern world teach that increased greatness and prosperity demand increased unity and partnership.
The underlying forces of European life are eroding old barriers and they are dissolving old suspicions.
Common institutions are expanding common interests.
National boundaries continue to fade under the impact of travel and commerce and communication.
A new generation is coming of age, unscarred by old hostilities or old ambitions, thinking of themselves as Europeans, their values shaped by a common Western culture.
These forces and the steadfast effort of all who share common goals will shape the future.
And unity based on hope will ultimately prove stronger than unity based on fear.
We realize that sharing the burden of leadership requires us to share the responsibilities of power.
As a step in this direction we support the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force composed of those nations which desire to participate.
We also welcome agreed new mechanisms for political consultation on mutual interests throughout the world with whatever changes in organization are necessary to make such consultation rapid and effective.
The experience of two world wars have taught us that the fundamental security interests of the United States and of Europe are the same.
What we learned in time of war, we must not now forget in time of peace.
for more than a decade we have sought to enlarge the independence and ease the rigors of the people of Eastern Europe.
We have used the tools of peaceful exchangein goods, in persons, and in ideasto open up communication with these restless nations that  Khrushchev refers to, sometimes, as children who have grown up too big to spank.
We have used limited direct assistance where the needs of our security have allowed us to follow the demands of our compassion.
In that spirit within the last month I have exercised the power granted the President by the Congress and I have reaffirmed the right of open trade with Poland and Yugoslavia.
In the third area of continuing concern, Latin America, we have renewed our commitment to the Alliance for Progress, we have sought peaceful settlement of disputes among the American nations, and we have supported the OAS effort to isolate Communist-controlled Cuba.
The Alliance for Progress is the central task today of this hemisphere.
That task is going ahead successfully.
But that alliance means more than economic assistance or investment.
It requires us to encourage and to support those democratic political forces which seek essential change within the framework of constitutional government.
It means preference for rapid evolution as the only real alternative to violent revolution.
To struggle to stand still in Latin America is just to throw the sand against the wind.
We must, of course, always be on guard against Communist subversion.
But anticommunism alone will never suffice to ensure our liberty or never suffice to fulfill our dreams.
That is going to take leadership, leadership that is dedicated to economic progress without uneconomic privilege, to social change which enhances social justice, to political reform which widens human freedom.
The resumption of relations with Panama proves once again the unmatched ability of our inter-American system to resolve these disputes among our good neighbors.
At the outset of that dispute with Panama, the first morning I stated to the President of Panama by telephone our willingness to seek a solution to all problems without conditions of any kind.
And I told him that our negotiators would meet theirs anywhere, any time, to discuss anything, and we would do what was fair and just and right.
We never departed from that willingness.
And on that basis the dispute was settled.
We now move toward solution with the generosity of friends who realize, as Woodrow Wilson once said, You cannot be friends on any other terms than upon the terms of equality.
The use of Cuba as a base for subversion and terror is an obstacle to our hopes for the Western Hemisphere.
Our first task must be, as it has been, to isolate Cuba from the inter-American system, to frustrate its efforts to destroy free governments, and to expose the weakness of communism so that all can see.
That policy is in effect and that policy is working.
The problems of this hemisphere would be far more serious if Castro today sat at the councils of the Organization of American States disrupting debate and blocking decision, if Castro had open channels of trade and communication along which subversion and terror could flow, it his economy had been a successful model rather than a dismal warning to all of his neighbors.
The effectiveness of our policy is more than a matter of trade statistics.
It has increased awareness of difference and danger, it has revealed the brutal nature of the Cuban regime, it has lessened opportunities for subversion, it has reduced the number of Castro's followers, and it has drained the resources of our adversaries who are spending more than $1 million a day.
We will continue this policy with every peaceful means at our command.
A fourth area of continuity and change is the battle for freedom in the far East.
In the last 20 years, in two wars, millions of Americans have fought to prevent the armed conquest of free Asia.
Having invested so heavily in the past, we will not weaken in the present.
The first American diplomatic mission to the far East was instructed to inform all countries that we will never make conquests, or ask any nation to let us establish ourselves in their countries.
That was our policy in 1832.
That is our policy in 1964.
Our conquering forces left Asia after World War II with less territory under our flag than ever before.
But if we have desired no conquest for ourselves, we have also steadfastly opposed it for others.
The independence of Asian nations is a link in our own freedom.
In Korea we proved the futility of direct aggression.
In Viet-Nam the Communists today try the more insidious, but the equally dangerous, methods of subversion, terror, and guerrilla warfare.
They conduct a campaign organized, directed, supplied, and supported from Hanoi.
This, too, we will prove futile.
Armed Communist attack on Viet-Nam is today a reality.
The fighting spirit of South Viet-Nam, as Secretary Rusk told us from there yesterday, is a reality.
The request of a friend and an ally for our help in this terrible moment is a reality.
The statement of the SEATO allies that Communist defeat is essential is a reality.
To fail to respond to these realities would reflect on our honor as a nation, would undermine worldwide confidence in our courage, would convince every nation in South Asia that it must now bow to Communist terms to survive.
The situation in Viet-Nam is difficult.
But there is an old American saying that when the going gets tough, the tough get going.
So let no one doubt that we are in this battle as long as South Viet-Nam wants our support and needs our assistance to protect its freedom.
I have already ordered measures to step up the fighting capacity of the South Vietnamese forces, to help improve the welfare and the morale of their civilian population, to keep our forces at whatever level continued independence and freedom require.
No negotiated settlement in Viet-Nam is possible, as long as the Communists hope to achieve victory by force.
Once war seems hopeless, then peace may be possible.
The door is always open to any settlement which assures the independence of South Viet-Nam, and its freedom to seek help for its protection.
In Laos we continue to support the Geneva agreements which offer what we think is the best hope of peace and independence for that strife-torn land.
At my instruction yesterday Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy went to Laos, and he has already arrived there for a first-hand examination of the developments, the developments that have come in the last 48 hours.
At the moment we are encouraged by reports of progress toward the reestablishment of orderly, legal government.
As for China itself, so long as the Communist Chinese pursue aggression, so long as the Communist Chinese preach violence, there can be and will be no easing of relationships.
There are some who prophesy that these policies will change.
But America must base her acts on present realities and not on future hopes.
It is not we who must reexamine our view of China.
It is the Chinese Communists who must reexamine their view of the world.
Nor can anyone doubt our unalterable commitment to the defense and the liberty of free China.
Meanwhile, we will say to our historic friends, the talented and courageous Chinese people on the mainland, that just as we opposed aggression against them, we must oppose aggression by their rulers and for the same reasons.
Fifth, is our concern with the new nations of Africa and Asia.
We welcome their emergence, for their goals flow from hopes like our own.
We began the revolt from colonial rule which is now reshaping other continents and which is now creating new nations.
Our mastery of technology has helped men to learn that poverty is not inevitable, that disease and hunger are not laws of nature.
Having helped create these hopes, we must now help satisfy them, or we will witness a rising discontent which may ultimately menace our own welfare.
What we desire for the developing nations is what we desire for ourselveseconomic progress which will permit them to shape their own institutions, and the independence which will allow them to take a dignified place in the world community.
So let there be no mistake about our intention to win the war against poverty at home, and let there be no mistake about our intention to fight that war around the world.
This battle will not be easy or it will not be swift.
It takes time to educate young minds and to shape the structure of a modern economy.
But the world must not be divided into rich nations and poor nations, or white nations or colored nations.
In such divisions, I know you must realize, stand the seeds of terrible discord and danger in the decades ahead.
for the wall between rich and poor is a wall of glass through which all can see.
We recognize the need for more stable prices for raw materials, for broader opportunity for trade among nations.
We are ready to help meet these claims, as we have already done, for example, with the negotiation of the International Coffee Agreement, and as we will do in the weeks ahead in the Kennedy Round.
We will continue with the direct economic assistance which has been a vital part of our policy for more than 20 years.
Last year the Congress reduced foreign aid from an original request of $4.
9 billion, later modified by General Clay's committee1 to $4.
5 billion, and Congress reduced that to a total of $3.
4 billion that they appropriated to me to deal with the problems of the 120 nations.
This year I ordered that our request be cut to the absolute minimum consistent with our commitments and our security, allowing for no cushions or no padding, and that was done.
1 Committee to Strengthen the Security of the free World.
Every dollar cut from that request for $3.
4 billion will directly diminish the security of the United States and you citizens.
And if, in spite of this clear need and this clear warning, substantial cuts are made again this year in either military or economic funds, I want to sound a warning that it will be my solemn duty as President to submit supplemental requests for additional amounts until the necessary funds of $3.
4 billion are appropriated.
In these areas, and in other areas of concern, we remain faithful to tested principle and deep conviction while shaping our actions to shifting dangers and to fresh opportunity.
This year is an election year in the United States.
And in this year let neither friend nor enemy abroad ever mistake growing discussion for growing dissension, or conflict over programs for conflict over principles, or political division for political paralysis.
This mistake in judgment has been made twice in our lifetime, to the sorrow of our adversaries.
Now let those at home, who share in the great democratic struggle, remember that the world is their audience and that attack and opposition to old policies must not be just for opposition's sake, that it requires responsible presentation of new choices, that in the protection of our security, the protection of American security, partisan politics must always yield to national need.
I recognize that those who seek to discuss great public issues in this election year must be informed on those issues.
Therefore, I have today instructed the Departments of State and Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency to be prepared and to provide all major candidates for the office of President with all possible information helpful to their discussion of American policy.
I hope candidates will accept this offer in the spirit in which it is madethe encouragement of the responsible discussion which is the touchstone of the democratic process.
In the past 20 years we have gradually become aware that America is forever bound up in the affairs of the whole world.
Our own future is linked to the future of all.
In great capitals and in tiny villages, in the councils of great powers and in the rooms of unknown planners, events are being set in motion which will continually call upon our attention and make demands on our resources,Prophecy is always unsure.
But if anything is certain, it is that this Nation can never again retreat from world responsibility.
You must know, and we must realize, that we will be involved in the world for the rest of our history.
We must accustom ourselves to working for liberty in the community of nations as we have pursued it in our community of States.
The struggle is not merely long.
The struggle is unending.
for it is part of man's ancient effort to master the passions of his mind, the demands of his spirit, the cruelties of nature.
Yes, we have entered a new arena.
The door has closed behind us.
And the old stage has passed into history.
Dangers will replace dangers, challenges will take the place of challenges, new hopes will come as old hopes fade.
There is no turning from a course which will require wisdom and much endurance so long as the name of America still sounds in this land and around the world.
Paul Miller and my fellow Americans: Last Friday I talked to the editors of the leading newspapers of this land and today I am honored to appear before their bosses.
This is the kind of a distinguished gathering that reminds me of a meeting in the Cabinet Room the other day.
Around that Cabinet table sat three Harvard men, two Yale men, Dean Rusk and three other Rhodes Scholars, and one graduate of the Southwest Texas State Teachers College.

It involves knowledge of strengths and awareness of limitations in each new situation.
The presence of offensive missiles in Cuba was a fact.
The presence of fallout in the atmosphere has been a fact.
The presence of guerrillas in Viet-Nam, at this hour, is a fact.
Such facts cannot be dealt with simply by historical judgments or general precepts.
They require concrete acts of courage, and wisdom, and often restraint.
These qualities of endurance and innovation, these qualities of continuity and change are at work in at least six major areas of continuing concern to you.
First, is our relationship with the Soviet Union, the center of our concern for peace.
Communists, using force and intrigue, seek to bring about a Communist-dominated world.
Our convictions, our interests, our life as a nation, demand that we resolutely oppose, with all of our might, that effort to dominate the world.
This, and this alone, is the cause of the cold war between us.
For the United States has nothing to fear from peaceful competition.
We welcome it and we will win it.
It is our system which flourishes and grows stronger in a world free from the threat of war.
And in such a competition all people, everywhere, will be the gainers.
Today, as we meet here, there are new pressures, new realities, which make it permissible to hope that the pursuit of peace is in the interests of the Soviet Union as it is in ours.
And our own restraint may be convincing the Soviet leaders of the reality that we, in America, seek neither war nor the destruction of the Soviet Union.
Thus I am very hopeful that we can take important steps toward the day when, in the words of the Old Testament, nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
We must remember that peace will not come suddenly.
It will not emerge dramatically from a single agreement or a single meeting.
It will be advanced by concrete and limited accommodations, by the gradual growth of common interests, by the increased awareness of shifting dangers and alignments, and by the development of trust in a good faith based on a reasoned view of the world.
Our own position is clear.
We will discuss any problem, we will listen to any proposal, we will pursue any agreement, we will take any action which might lessen the chance of war without sacrificing the interests of our allies or our own ability to defend the alliance against attack.
In other words, our guard is up, but our hand is out.
I am taking two actions today which reflect both our desire to reduce tension and our unwillingness to risk weakness.
I have ordered a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched uranium, to be carried out over a 4-year period.
When added to previous reductions, this will mean an overall decrease in the production of plutonium by 20 percent, and of enriched uranium by 4&deg; percent.
By bringing production in line with need, and the chart shows now that our production is here, and our need is here, and our reduction today will bring it here, we think we will reduce tension while we maintain all the necessary power.
We must not operate a WPA nuclear project, just to provide employment when our needs have been met.
And in reaching these decisions I have been in close consultation with Prime Minister Douglas-Home.
Simultaneously with my announcement now, Chairman Khrushchev is releasing a statement in Moscow, at 2 of the clock our time, in which he makes definite commitments to steps toward a more peaceful world.
He agrees to discontinue the construction of two big new atomic reactors for the production of plutonium over the next several years, to reduce substantially the production of U235 for nuclear weapons, and to allocate more fissionable material for peaceful uses.
This is not disarmament.
This is not a declaration of peace.
But it is a hopeful sign and it is a step forward which we welcome and which we can take in the hope that the world may yet, one day, live without the fear of war.
At the same time, I have reaffirmed all the safeguards against weakening our nuclear strength which we adopted at the time of the test ban treaty.
The second area of continuing effort is the development of Atlantic partnership with a stronger and a more unified Europe.
Having begun this policy when peril was great, we will not now abandon it as success moves closer.
We worked for a stronger and more prosperous Europe, and Europe is strong and prosperous today because of our work and beyond our expectation.
We have supported a close partnership with a more unified Europe and in the past 15 years more peaceful steps have been taken in this direction than have been taken at any time in our history.
The pursuit of this goal, like the pursuit of any large and worthy cause, will not be easy or will not be untroubled.
But the realities of the modern world teach that increased greatness and prosperity demand increased unity and partnership.
The underlying forces of European life are eroding old barriers and they are dissolving old suspicions.
Common institutions are expanding common interests.
National boundaries continue to fade under the impact of travel and commerce and communication.
A new generation is coming of age, unscarred by old hostilities or old ambitions, thinking of themselves as Europeans, their values shaped by a common Western culture.
These forces and the steadfast effort of all who share common goals will shape the future.
And unity based on hope will ultimately prove stronger than unity based on fear.
We realize that sharing the burden of leadership requires us to share the responsibilities of power.
As a step in this direction we support the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force composed of those nations which desire to participate.
We also welcome agreed new mechanisms for political consultation on mutual interests throughout the world with whatever changes in organization are necessary to make such consultation rapid and effective.
The experience of two world wars have taught us that the fundamental security interests of the United States and of Europe are the same.
What we learned in time of war, we must not now forget in time of peace.
for more than a decade we have sought to enlarge the independence and ease the rigors of the people of Eastern Europe.
We have used the tools of peaceful exchangein goods, in persons, and in ideasto open up communication with these restless nations that  Khrushchev refers to, sometimes, as children who have grown up too big to spank.
We have used limited direct assistance where the needs of our security have allowed us to follow the demands of our compassion.
In that spirit within the last month I have exercised the power granted the President by the Congress and I have reaffirmed the right of open trade with Poland and Yugoslavia.
In the third area of continuing concern, Latin America, we have renewed our commitment to the Alliance for Progress, we have sought peaceful settlement of disputes among the American nations, and we have supported the OAS effort to isolate Communist-controlled Cuba.
The Alliance for Progress is the central task today of this hemisphere.
That task is going ahead successfully.
But that alliance means more than economic assistance or investment.
It requires us to encourage and to support those democratic political forces which seek essential change within the framework of constitutional government.
It means preference for rapid evolution as the only real alternative to violent revolution.
To struggle to stand still in Latin America is just to throw the sand against the wind.
We must, of course, always be on guard against Communist subversion.
But anticommunism alone will never suffice to ensure our liberty or never suffice to fulfill our dreams.
That is going to take leadership, leadership that is dedicated to economic progress without uneconomic privilege, to social change which enhances social justice, to political reform which widens human freedom.
The resumption of relations with Panama proves once again the unmatched ability of our inter-American system to resolve these disputes among our good neighbors.
At the outset of that dispute with Panama, the first morning I stated to the President of Panama by telephone our willingness to seek a solution to all problems without conditions of any kind.
And I told him that our negotiators would meet theirs anywhere, any time, to discuss anything, and we would do what was fair and just and right.
We never departed from that willingness.
And on that basis the dispute was settled.
We now move toward solution with the generosity of friends who realize, as Woodrow Wilson once said, You cannot be friends on any other terms than upon the terms of equality.
The use of Cuba as a base for subversion and terror is an obstacle to our hopes for the Western Hemisphere.
Our first task must be, as it has been, to isolate Cuba from the inter-American system, to frustrate its efforts to destroy free governments, and to expose the weakness of communism so that all can see.
That policy is in effect and that policy is working.
The problems of this hemisphere would be far more serious if Castro today sat at the councils of the Organization of American States disrupting debate and blocking decision, if Castro had open channels of trade and communication along which subversion and terror could flow, it his economy had been a successful model rather than a dismal warning to all of his neighbors.
The effectiveness of our policy is more than a matter of trade statistics.
It has increased awareness of difference and danger, it has revealed the brutal nature of the Cuban regime, it has lessened opportunities for subversion, it has reduced the number of Castro's followers, and it has drained the resources of our adversaries who are spending more than $1 million a day.
We will continue this policy with every peaceful means at our command.
A fourth area of continuity and change is the battle for freedom in the far East.
In the last 20 years, in two wars, millions of Americans have fought to prevent the armed conquest of free Asia.
Having invested so heavily in the past, we will not weaken in the present.
The first American diplomatic mission to the far East was instructed to inform all countries that we will never make conquests, or ask any nation to let us establish ourselves in their countries.
That was our policy in 1832.
That is our policy in 1964.
Our conquering forces left Asia after World War II with less territory under our flag than ever before.
But if we have desired no conquest for ourselves, we have also steadfastly opposed it for others.
The independence of Asian nations is a link in our own freedom.
In Korea we proved the futility of direct aggression.
In Viet-Nam the Communists today try the more insidious, but the equally dangerous, methods of subversion, terror, and guerrilla warfare.
They conduct a campaign organized, directed, supplied, and supported from Hanoi.
This, too, we will prove futile.
Armed Communist attack on Viet-Nam is today a reality.
The fighting spirit of South Viet-Nam, as Secretary Rusk told us from there yesterday, is a reality.
The request of a friend and an ally for our help in this terrible moment is a reality.
The statement of the SEATO allies that Communist defeat is essential is a reality.
To fail to respond to these realities would reflect on our honor as a nation, would undermine worldwide confidence in our courage, would convince every nation in South Asia that it must now bow to Communist terms to survive.
The situation in Viet-Nam is difficult.
But there is an old American saying that when the going gets tough, the tough get going.
So let no one doubt that we are in this battle as long as South Viet-Nam wants our support and needs our assistance to protect its freedom.
I have already ordered measures to step up the fighting capacity of the South Vietnamese forces, to help improve the welfare and the morale of their civilian population, to keep our forces at whatever level continued independence and freedom require.
No negotiated settlement in Viet-Nam is possible, as long as the Communists hope to achieve victory by force.
Once war seems hopeless, then peace may be possible.
The door is always open to any settlement which assures the independence of South Viet-Nam, and its freedom to seek help for its protection.
In Laos we continue to support the Geneva agreements which offer what we think is the best hope of peace and independence for that strife-torn land.
At my instruction yesterday Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy went to Laos, and he has already arrived there for a first-hand examination of the developments, the developments that have come in the last 48 hours.
At the moment we are encouraged by reports of progress toward the reestablishment of orderly, legal government.
As for China itself, so long as the Communist Chinese pursue aggression, so long as the Communist Chinese preach violence, there can be and will be no easing of relationships.
There are some who prophesy that these policies will change.
But America must base her acts on present realities and not on future hopes.
It is not we who must reexamine our view of China.
It is the Chinese Communists who must reexamine their view of the world.
Nor can anyone doubt our unalterable commitment to the defense and the liberty of free China.
Meanwhile, we will say to our historic friends, the talented and courageous Chinese people on the mainland, that just as we opposed aggression against them, we must oppose aggression by their rulers and for the same reasons.
Fifth, is our concern with the new nations of Africa and Asia.
We welcome their emergence, for their goals flow from hopes like our own.
We began the revolt from colonial rule which is now reshaping other continents and which is now creating new nations.
Our mastery of technology has helped men to learn that poverty is not inevitable, that disease and hunger are not laws of nature.
Having helped create these hopes, we must now help satisfy them, or we will witness a rising discontent which may ultimately menace our own welfare.
What we desire for the developing nations is what we desire for ourselveseconomic progress which will permit them to shape their own institutions, and the independence which will allow them to take a dignified place in the world community.
So let there be no mistake about our intention to win the war against poverty at home, and let there be no mistake about our intention to fight that war around the world.
This battle will not be easy or it will not be swift.
It takes time to educate young minds and to shape the structure of a modern economy.
But the world must not be divided into rich nations and poor nations, or white nations or colored nations.
In such divisions, I know you must realize, stand the seeds of terrible discord and danger in the decades ahead.
for the wall between rich and poor is a wall of glass through which all can see.
We recognize the need for more stable prices for raw materials, for broader opportunity for trade among nations.
We are ready to help meet these claims, as we have already done, for example, with the negotiation of the International Coffee Agreement, and as we will do in the weeks ahead in the Kennedy Round.
We will continue with the direct economic assistance which has been a vital part of our policy for more than 20 years.
Last year the Congress reduced foreign aid from an original request of $4.
9 billion, later modified by General Clay's committee1 to $4.
5 billion, and Congress reduced that to a total of $3.
4 billion that they appropriated to me to deal with the problems of the 120 nations.
This year I ordered that our request be cut to the absolute minimum consistent with our commitments and our security, allowing for no cushions or no padding, and that was done.
1 Committee to Strengthen the Security of the free World.
Every dollar cut from that request for $3.
4 billion will directly diminish the security of the United States and you citizens.
And if, in spite of this clear need and this clear warning, substantial cuts are made again this year in either military or economic funds, I want to sound a warning that it will be my solemn duty as President to submit supplemental requests for additional amounts until the necessary funds of $3.
4 billion are appropriated.
In these areas, and in other areas of concern, we remain faithful to tested principle and deep conviction while shaping our actions to shifting dangers and to fresh opportunity.
This year is an election year in the United States.
And in this year let neither friend nor enemy abroad ever mistake growing discussion for growing dissension, or conflict over programs for conflict over principles, or political division for political paralysis.
This mistake in judgment has been made twice in our lifetime, to the sorrow of our adversaries.
Now let those at home, who share in the great democratic struggle, remember that the world is their audience and that attack and opposition to old policies must not be just for opposition's sake, that it requires responsible presentation of new choices, that in the protection of our security, the protection of American security, partisan politics must always yield to national need.
I recognize that those who seek to discuss great public issues in this election year must be informed on those issues.
Therefore, I have today instructed the Departments of State and Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency to be prepared and to provide all major candidates for the office of President with all possible information helpful to their discussion of American policy.
I hope candidates will accept this offer in the spirit in which it is madethe encouragement of the responsible discussion which is the touchstone of the democratic process.
In the past 20 years we have gradually become aware that America is forever bound up in the affairs of the whole world.
Our own future is linked to the future of all.
In great capitals and in tiny villages, in the councils of great powers and in the rooms of unknown planners, events are being set in motion which will continually call upon our attention and make demands on our resources,Prophecy is always unsure.
But if anything is certain, it is that this Nation can never again retreat from world responsibility.
You must know, and we must realize, that we will be involved in the world for the rest of our history.
We must accustom ourselves to working for liberty in the community of nations as we have pursued it in our community of States.
The struggle is not merely long.
The struggle is unending.
for it is part of man's ancient effort to master the passions of his mind, the demands of his spirit, the cruelties of nature.
Yes, we have entered a new arena.
The door has closed behind us.
And the old stage has passed into history.
Dangers will replace dangers, challenges will take the place of challenges, new hopes will come as old hopes fade.
There is no turning from a course which will require wisdom and much endurance so long as the name of America still sounds in this land and around the world.
Friends and reportersI hope you are the sameand children of reporters: I am so glad so many of you youngsters are here today.
I want to prove to you that your fathers are really on the job sometimes.
I am glad your mothers came, too.
I suspect they are also very pleased to find your fathers working today.
I thought you children deserved a press conference because I know that you have taken so many telephone calls for your fathers and mothers, and located your wandering parents at so many receptions, that you have become good cub reporters, too.
Someone even suggested you should be accredited to the White House.
Here you are.
I think that that person ought to remain anonymous, at least until he has his hair cut again.
When the press conference is over, I want to ask all the children to come up here and pose with me for a group picture.
And let us do not have any of the mommas or poppas.
They are always crowding into pictures, anyway.
Now let me get the business done first and then we will have the children here.
Secretary of Defense McNamara will leave Washington Friday for West Germany, where he will continue his discussions on matters of mutual defense interest with Minister of Defense  von Hassel.
The discussions with Minister von Hassel will include cooperative research and development, existing cooperative logistics programs and a continuation of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany's military purchase offset program.
I have asked Secretary McNamara to proceed from Bonn to Saigon, where he expects to receive firsthand reports on the progress of military and civilian operations in South Viet Nam since his last visit.
The Secretary will be accompanied to Saigon by the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Wheeler, and Assistant Secretaries of Defense Arthur Sylvester and John McNaughton.
I have today issued an Executive order establishing a Maritime Advisory Committee to assist the Government in considering matters of vital importance to the maritime industry.
Committee membership will include the Secretary of Commerce, as Chairman.
an; the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration, and an equal number of distinguished representatives of labor, management, and the public.
Because of the impact of the activities of certain other governmental agencies upon maritime policies, I have requested the Secretaries of State, Agriculture, and Navy, and the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, to participate in the Committee's proceedings.
The creation of this committee provides a useful forum for a careful and constructive consideration of the national defense, trade, manpower, and labor relations programs of one of our oldest and most important industries.
I have today sent a letter to Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia, expressing my appreciation for the work of the Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures in keeping the country informed on employment trends.
Senator Byrd's reports show a favorable employment trend in recent months.
The figures for March show that total civilian employment was 15,700 below March a year ago in the Government.
I told Senator Byrd that we are going to do everything possible to hold down the regular seasonal increases in employment which occur in the spring of the year as outdoor work opens up.
I am determined to hold Federal employment to the minimum required to conduct the public business effectively.
I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, who normally employ a good many people at this time of the year, to be very careful in the people they put on in the next few months.
I have met in the last few days with key leaders of business and labor, as you know.
I am pleased with the gains made by both groups, not at the expense of each other, but as the result of our record month, $108 billion expansion of gross national product.
We have a higher productivity.
We have lower taxes.
We have a better record of price stability than any other industrial country, and some of the gains, side by side, are, for example: Business corporate profits after taxes this year are running $9 billion above 1961, $31 billion against $22 billion.
Corporate cash flowafter-tax profitsis running $16 billion above 1961, $65 billion against $49 billion.
The rate of return on stockholders equity in manufacturing corporations was 9.
2 percent for 1960.
It was percent for 1963; 11.
4 percent for the fourth quarter of 1963.
And now for labor: The long-term unemployment in April was down 11 percent from March.
Civilian employment after seasonal correction is up 750,000 from March, and 1.
8 million over a year ago, 4.
4 million from early 1961, and 1.
7 million in the past year.
Total labor income is up about $50 billion after taxes in 3 years.
The wage and salary share in corporate gross product has held up better in the 1961-64 expansion than in any other postwar upswing.
It is above 72 percent now.
It dropped to 68-70 percent in the earlier upswings.
So with profits and wages and jobs all rising strongly, without rising prices, I asked business to hold the price line or even cut prices and to share productivity gains with consumers.
I asked labor to hold wage increases within the bounds of the economy's productivity increases.
If they do this, the country can go on to the heights of full employment and full use of our great productive potential, to the greater gain, I think, of all our countrymen.
I have sent a group of businessmen to Europe, representing the meat packing and cattle industries, to explore what can be done to substantially increase U.
S.
exports of beef.
I will receive a full report from them when they return later in the month.
The Department of Defense has taken steps today to purchase an additional 40 million pounds annually of U.
S.
beef.
This will be in addition to the 70 million pounds already announced.
Final data on strikes during 1963 is encouraging and just became available.
They showed that 1963 established a new postwar low in strike activity.
The estimated working time lost through strikes last year was the lowest percentage since World War II0.
13 of 1 percent.
The 941,000 workers involved in strikes were the fewest since 1942.
The 3,364 strikes that began in 1963 was the second lowest total since the war.
Twice as much time was lost because of industrial injuries last year as was lost because of strikes.
I want to congratulate management and labor publicly today on this very fine record they have made.
I am announcing the appointment of  Charlotte Moton Hubbard as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.
Hubbard, whose father,  Robert Moton, succeeded Booker T.
Washington as President of Tuskegee Institute, has a distinguished record in education, civic affairs, and government.
In my first official foreign policy statement as President of the United States, I pledged to the representatives of Latin American countries the best efforts of this Nation toward the fulfillment of the Alliance for Progress.
We are carrying out that pledge.
I intend to ask the Ambassadors of each of our Alliance partners to return again to the White House, to come here next Monday to review some of our work in support of Latin American development efforts.
At that time I will sign several new loan agreements and commitment letters for the most recently developed Latin American projects.
While the efforts of governments are vitally important in the struggle for hemispheric progress, the efforts of private persons and private groups can also have great impact.
Assistant Secretary Mann has given me a very encouraging report on the progress of the partners of the Alliance program.
The program is an effort to encourage private groups in the United States to work together with Latin Americans in the hemisphere's war against poverty and ignorance and disease.
During the past 6 months, private citizens in a number of States in our country have organized to establish contact with interested Latin Americans.
I would like to pay these people and these groups in Latin America and the United States a very special tribute today.
I thank them warmly for their interest and efforts in this most important work.
I am sending to Congress today a request for a supplemental appropriation amounting to roughly $40 million for the Chamizal settlement.
The additional funds will enable the United States to carry out the recently ratified Chamizal Convention.
This Convention, which was approved by the Senate in December 1963, settles a long-standing boundary dispute between the United States and Mexico.
With these funds, we will be able to act quickly in purchasing properties in El Paso on a basis which is designed to be fair to our own citizens.
Let me also report three new developments with respect to our relations with Panama.
First, Special Ambassador Anderson came to see me this morning.
He has returned from a very fruitful visit to Panama, during which he met in a very cordial atmosphere with President Chiari, Special Ambassador Illueca, and with other Panamanian officials, for the purpose of having a preliminary exchange of views on U.
S.
-Panamanian problems.
I met with the Special Ambassadors today, both from Panama and the United States, and I expressed to both of them my sincere hope for a mutually satisfactory outcome of their talks, in view of the importance to both countries, in view of the importance to the hemisphere, in view of the importance to the free world.
Second, I have received a report on the work of the special U.
S.
economic team to Panama, which I mentioned about 2 weeks ago.
The team went to Panama on April 27, and held a number of conversations with Panamanian economic officials and private sector representatives.
The talks were most fruitful and constructive, and helped to lay the foundation for more detailed discussions later in the spring regarding U.
S.
cooperation in Panama's effort to improve its economy under the Alliance for Progress.
Third, in an effort to further improve the formulation and execution of U.
S.
policy towards Panama, I have directed our Ambassador in Panama to chair a committee which includes the Governor of the Panama Canal Zone and the Commander in Chief U.
S.
Southern Command.
This committee will meet regularly to discuss all aspects of U.
S.
-Panamanian relations and make proposals regarding them.
And finally, I have today accepted lifetime membership in the Vanderburgh Humane Society of Evansville, Ind.
I will be happy to answer any questions, if you have any.
I would hope and anticipate the civil rights bill would be disposed of in a reasonably short time.
We have been debating that bill now for almost 2 months and a good many amendments have been offered and are being considered.
But I hope they can pass the bill the end of the month or the early part of the next month, and then we can get on with our food stamp plan in the Senate, our poverty bill, our Appalachia bill, and our medical aid bill.
I hope that we can have the pay bill reported by the committee very shortly.
In the event those bills are not acted uponand some cynical people think that there may be a deliberate slowdown in the Senate for the purpose of voting on the civil rights bill among some people, and among others for the purpose of not voting on any bill.
If there should be that kind of a slowdown, I would seriously consider coming back here, of course, after the Republican convention and, if necessary, coming back after the Democratic convention.
The people's business must come first and I think that the people of this country are entitled to have a vote on these important measures.
This administration is entitled to have a vote on them, and I am going to ask the Congress to vote them up or down.
I am not anticipating what the Congress will do at this moment.
I hope they will pass all the bills.
If they do not pass the bills, I will seriously consider calling them back until they vote the bills up or down.
I will cross that bridge when I get to it.
I think that the people of Alabama decided they wanted to vote for their Governor and they expressed their sentiment just as the people of Wisconsin and the people of Indiana have done in that connection.
In Alabama they voted for him and I see that it has no real consequence beyond the boundaries of Alabama.
Well, I am going to Maryland tomorrow in connection with the Appalachia program.
I have invited the Senators of both parties to go with me to all the States involved.
I am going to take part in no primaries, as I have repeatedly said.
We are constantly examining conditions in Viet-Nam.
As I stated earlier in the day, Secretary McNamara is going back there in the early part of this week.
Secretary Rusk was there for the last 2 or 3 weeks.
McNamara was there a short time ago.
The people who are responsible for carrying on our operations there are constantly examining it to be sure that it is as efficient and effective as possible.
I have no doubt but what they will do their job well.
What officials of this administration say that we have an agreement that there will be no over flights? I am not familiar with any such agreement that we have with the Russian people.
Well, I think they speak very well for themselves.
He got 24 percent of the vote in Wisconsin and a little less than 20 percent of the vote in Indiana.
I would not think that would beless than 20 percent of the total vote polled would be any overwhelming endorsement of a man's record.
Well, the story of my beagles is that they are very nice dogs and I enjoy them and I think they enjoy me.
I would like for the people to enjoy both of us.
Well, I strive to please, and if you will give me any indication of how you feel about the matter, I will try to work it into my plans in the future.
I had observed some little comments by some of the newspaper people about their desire to have live television, and I am trying my best to accommodate them.
Although I do not have it very often, I hope all of you are enjoying it today.
I sometimes think that these press conferences can be conducted just as accurately and perhaps as effectively in the President's office, but I try to give you a variety.
As I told you in the beginning, I always want to remain accessible.
I hope the press will never be critical of me for being overaccessible.
I think that people have a right to vote for any group of electors they want.
I think that they should have the right to vote for any candidate and any party that they desire, without confusion.
No.
The only hazing I have received in that respect is from the newspaper people and I think we made a grievous error when I asked them to walk around the block with me the other day.
The doctors, I thinkas a matter of fact, I read a report from some doctor, I do not know just which oneand I have been examined frequently since I have been in the White House the last 6 months, and sometimes at greater lengths than I am being examined here todaythey tell me that my blood pressure is 125 over 78 and that my heart is normal.
I do not have any aches and pains.
I feel fine.
I get adequate rest and good pay, and plenty to eat.
I do not know anyone that is concerned about my health.
Certainly none of my doctors are concerned about it.
Yes, I think it is being effective, to the extent of the cooperation they have given us.
I regret very much to see any of our allies who do not feel that they could cooperate with us all the way.
We regret that, but nonetheless we are going to continue our policy of economic isolation in the hope that we can prevent the spread of Castro's communism throughout the hemisphere.
We are going to constantly insist that our allies do likewise.
But we do not have the responsibility for any foreign policy except our own.
They will, in the last analysis, make the final decision, but we are going to continue to urge them to join us in a policy of economic isolation, so that communism will not be channeled out to other nations in this hemisphere.
Yes.
Senator Fulbright had announced some engagements in foreign capitals several weeks ago.
When I learned that he was going to be abroad anyway, I asked him to undertake some discussions that I thought would be in the national interest.
That is not an unusual thing.
Senator Mansfield did that last year on behalf of the late, beloved President Kennedy, and other Senators and Congressmen frequently do it at the suggestion of the President or the State Department.
I have every reason to believe that Senator Fulbright will carry on some very useful discussions and have a very good report when he returns.
I stated my views on Senator Fulbright's position in my New York speech before the Associated Press.
My asking him to carry on these discussions for us did not indicate either approval or disapproval.
I had already indicated that we were not in agreement, in toto, with his views on either Cuba or Panama.
I beg your pardon, but I am not understanding what you are saying.
You will either have to speak louder or Well, I had an informal discussion with a German newspaperman, in company with a friend.
In the course of that conversation I expressed to him the determination of the American people to avoid war, if at all possible, that we wanted to find a road to peace and we would do everything we could in that direction.
I told him that I thought the best way to do that was to follow the Golden Rule, to do unto others as you would have them do unto you, and to try to find ways and means of finding areas of agreement.
I expressed that as my own view, and as the policy of this country.
I have no differences with Chancellor Erhard in that regard.
I said no more to the newspaperman than I had said publicly following our visit with him, and than we said in our communique, and as I repeat today.
I think it is very important to the people of the world that the leaders of the countries of the world pursue every possible road to peace and to try to achieve it.
I have no doubt but what the German people will, in their own way, and through their own qualified people, follow that objective.
As I say, there are no differences between Chancellor Erhard and myself now, and there have not been.
Our visit was a very fruitful one and we are in complete agreement.
The speech that he delivered a few days ago following this article clearly points that out.
No, I think that we have to be constantly concerned with economic conditions, as I tried to indicate from my statements to you from time to time.
While our unemployment has dropped from 5.
8 to 5.
4, we would like to see it go down below 5 this year, as quickly as possible.
We would like to see many of our young people that are now unemployed put to work under our new program that Sargent Shriver has suggested to the Congress.
I think we have to be concerned with the utilization of idle plant capacity.
We have to be concerned with the value of the dollar.
We never know what next month or next quarter or next year may lead to.
We think that now we are enjoying a very fine record, but we are constantly on the alert for any developments that may indicate otherwise.
We are prepared to take whatever measures may be necessary to attempt to avoid any decline.
We would not say for a moment, though, that recessions are not possible.
Yes, progress has been made, and further progress, I believe, will be made following Secretary Rusk's visit in the next few days to the NATO ministers meeting.
I think that a good many countries are giving serious consideration to making contributions in that area to keep communism from enveloping that part of the world.
We welcome that help and we expect to receive it.
Yes.
I have given a great deal of thought to it.
I appealed to 139 of the big corporate leaders of this country the other evening to do all they could in the way of additional capital investments to provide additional jobs.
We have talked to mayors' groups, we have met with Governors' groups, we have met with private groups.
We have urged them all to develop local plans.
I have talked to the mayors of large cities, such as Pittsburgh, New York City, and other places in the country.
I have talked to Governors, not only from the Appalachian States, but Governors from all over the country.
We feel now that it is the job of the local community and the regional area and the State to do their local planning and not to be told from Washington what they ought to do, but to tell us what they want to do and how we can help them.
Thank you,  President.
President Hatcher, Governor Romney, Senators McNamara and Hart, Congressmen Meader and Staebler, and other members of the fine Michigan delegation, members of the graduating class, my fellow Americans:It is a great pleasure to be here today.
This university has been coeducational since 1870, but I do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a Detroit high school girl said, In choosing a college, you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school.
Well, we can find both here at Michigan, although perhaps at different hours.
I came out here today very anxious to meet the Michigan student whose father told a friend of mine that his son's education had been a real value.
It stopped his mother from bragging about him.
I have come today from the turmoil of your Capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country.
The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people.
Our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation.
For a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent.
For half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people.
The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization.
Your imagination, your initiative, and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions are buried under unbridled growth.
For in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.
The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all.
It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time.
But that is just the beginning.
The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents.
It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness.
It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community.
It is a place where man can renew contact with nature.
It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race.
It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods.
But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work.
It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.
So I want to talk to you today about three places where we begin to build the Great Society  in our cities, in our countryside, and in our classrooms.
Many of you will live to see the day, perhaps 50 years from now, when there will be 400 million Americans four-fifths of them in urban areas.
In the remainder of this century urban population will double, city land will double, and we will have to build homes, highways, and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled.
So in the next 40 years we must rebuild the entire urban United States.
Aristotle said: Men come together in cities in order to live, but they remain together in order to live the good life.
It is harder and harder to live the good life in American cities today.
The catalog of ills is long: there is the decay of the centers and the despoiling of the suburbs.
There is not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic.
Open land is vanishing and old landmarks are violated.
Worst of all expansion is eroding the precious and time honored values of community with neighbors and communion with nature.
The loss of these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference.
Our society will never be great until our cities are great.
Today the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders.
New experiments are already going on.
It will be the task of your generation to make the American city a place where future generations will come, not only to live but to live the good life.
I understand that if I stayed here tonight I would see that Michigan students are really doing their best to live the good life.
This is the place where the Peace Corps was started.
It is inspiring to see how all of you, while you are in this country, are trying so hard to live at the level of the people.
A second place where we begin to build the Great Society is in our countryside.
We have always prided ourselves on being not only America the strong and America the free, but America the beautiful.
Today that beauty is in danger.
The water we drink, the food we eat, the very air that we breathe, are threatened with pollution.
Our parks are overcrowded, our seashores overburdened.
Green fields and dense forests are disappearing.
A few years ago we were greatly concerned about the Ugly American.
Today we must act to prevent an ugly America.
For once the battle is lost, once our natural splendor is destroyed, it can never be recaptured.
And once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be wasted.
A third place to build the Great Society is in the classrooms of America.
There your children's lives will be shaped.
Our society will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan the farthest reaches of thought and imagination.
We are still far from that goal.
Today, 8 million adult Americans, more than the entire population of Michigan, have not finished 5 years of school.
Nearly 20 million have not finished 8 years of school.
Nearly 54 million  more than one-quarter of all America  have not even finished high school.
Each year more than 100,000 high school graduates, with proved ability, do not enter college because they cannot afford it.
And if we cannot educate today's youth, what will we do in 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million greater than 1960? And high school enrollment will rise by 5 million.
College enrollment will increase by more than 3 million.
In many places, classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated.
Most of our qualified teachers are underpaid, and many of our paid teachers are unqualified.
So we must give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from.
Poverty must not be a bar to learning, and learning must offer an escape from poverty.
But more classrooms and more teachers are not enough.
We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size.
This means better training for our teachers.
It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor.
It means exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation.
These are three of the central issues of the Great Society.
While our Government has many programs directed at those issues, I do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problems.
But I do promise this: We are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest knowledge from all over the world to find those answers for America.
I intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of White House conferences and meetings  on the cities, on natural beauty, on the quality of education, and on other emerging challenges.
And from these meetings and from this inspiration and from these studies we will begin to set our course toward the Great Society.
The solution to these problems does not rest on a massive program in Washington, nor can it rely solely on the strained resources of local authority.
They require us to create new concepts of cooperation, a creative federalism, between the National Capital and the leaders of local communities.
Woodrow Wilson once wrote: Every man sent out from his university should be a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time.
Within your lifetime powerful forces, already loosed, will take us toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience, almost beyond the bounds of our imagination.
For better or for worse, your generation has been appointed by history to deal with those problems and to lead America toward a new age.
You have the chance never before afforded to any people in any age.
You can help build a society where the demands of morality, and the needs of the spirit, can be realized in the life of the Nation.
So, will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which God enjoins and the law requires, whatever his belief, or race, or the color of his skin?Will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty?Will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations to live in enduring peace  as neighbors and not as mortal enemies?Will you join in the battle to build the Great Society, to prove that our material progress is only the foundation on which we will build a richer life of mind and spirit?There are those timid souls who say this battle cannot be won; that we are condemned to a soulless wealth.
I do not agree.
We have the power to shape the civilization that we want.
But we need your will, your labor, your hearts, if we are to build that kind of society.
Those who came to this land sought to build more than just a new country.
They sought a new world.
So I have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision our reality.
So let us from this moment begin our work so that in the future men will look back and say: It was then, after a long and weary way, that man turned the exploits of his genius to the full enrichment of his life.
Thank you.
Goodby.
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to announce the successful development of a major new strategic manned aircraft system, which will be employed by the Strategic Air Command.
This system employs the new SR-71 aircraft, and provides a long-range, advanced strategic reconnaissance plane for military use, capable of worldwide reconnaissance for military operations.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, when reviewing the RS-70, emphasized the importance of the strategic reconnaissance mission.
The SR-71 aircraft reconnaissance system is the most advanced in the world.
The aircraft will fly at more than three times the speed of sound.
It will operate at altitudes in excess of 80,000 feet.
It will use the most advanced observation equipment of all kinds in the world.
The aircraft will provide the strategic forces of the United States with an outstanding long-range reconnaissance capability.
The system will be used during periods of military hostilities and in other situations in which the United States military forces may be confronting foreign military forces.
The SR-7I uses the same J-58 engine as the experimental interceptor previously announced, but it is substantially heavier and it has a longer range.
The considerably heavier gross weight permits it to accommodate the multiple reconnaissance sensors needed by the Strategic Air Command to accomplish their strategic reconnaissance mission in a military environment.
This billion dollar program was initiated in February of 1963.
The first operational aircraft will begin flight testing in early 1965.
Deployment of production units to the Strategic Air Command will begin shortly thereafter.
Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept fully informed on the nature of and the progress in this aircraft program.
Further information on this major advanced aircraft system will be released from time to time at the appropriate military secret classification levels.
I am pleased to announce today that in the year ending July 30th American exports of farm products broke all records, reaching an all-time high of $6 billion 151 million.
This represents a 20 percent increase in farm exports in a single yeara $1 billion and a 35 percent gain over the level for the year 1960.
Once again American agriculture has demonstrated its ability to succeed in highly competitive world markets.
The trade surplus in agriculture last year was over $2 billion, the highest in 50 years.
This represents a substantial contribution to the plus side of our balance-of-payments ledger.
Farm exports contribute to the increased prosperity of our farm economy.
The latest revised estimates from the Department of Agriculture show that net farm income in 1963 was $12 billion 518 million, more than a quarter of a billion dollars higher than we had estimated 6 months ago.
The net income per farm increased from $2,961 in 1960 to $3,504 in 1963, an increase in this period, from 1960 to 1963, of more than 18 percent.
I think I should comment briefly on a number of international problems.
First, I think most Europeans know that the United States has never had any interest whatever in trying to dominate Europe or any other area of the world.
On the contrary, the United States has constantly supported the strengthening of the free nations of Europe.
We believe that Europe and the United States have great common interests, common purposes, and common obligations.
So we have never supposed that any European country would need to choose between its ties to the United States and its ties to Europe.
We believe that any effort to force such a choice would be bad for Europe, bad for the alliance.
And I have found, I might say, general agreement on this view in my talks with Prime Minister Home, Chancellor Erhard, President Segni, and many other European leaders who have been here this year.
Second, I should like to call your attention to the excellent series of meetings which we have had in Washington this last week with the leaders of Australia, New Zealand, and Malaysia.
These meetings have allowed the United States to underscore its support for the freedom and independence of three most important Pacific states; and our friendship and understanding with these governments, I feel, has been greatly strengthened.
Third, in the continuing discussion of Southeast Asia, let me state American policy once more.
We are determined to support the freedom and the independence of South Viet-Nam, where Prime Minister Khanh and Ambassador Taylor have established the closest understanding with each other.
They are in continual consultation and the policies of the two nations are the same; namely, to increase the effectiveness of the whole program in that countrypolitical, social, economic, and military.
It is true that there is danger and provocation from the North, and such provocation could force a response, but it is also true that the United States seeks no wider war.
Other friends suggest that this problem must be moved to a conference table and, indeed, if others would keep the solemn agreements already signed at a conference table, there would be no problem in South Viet-Nam.
If those who practice terror and ambush and murder will simply honor their existing agreements, there can easily be peace in Southeast Asia immediately.
But we do not believe in a conference called to ratify terror, so our policy is unchanged.
For 10 years, and in three different administrations, the United States has been committed to the freedom and the independence of South Viet-Nam, helping others to help themselves.
In those 10 years, we have taken whatever actions were necessary, sending men and supplies for different specific purposes at different times.
We shall stick to that policy and we shall continue our effort to make it even more effective.
We shall do the same in our support for the legitimate Government of Laos.
Fourth, this week I have conferred with the foreign ministers of this hemisphere at the White House and our eyes turned to Latin America.
Down in Mexico there has been a highly successful meeting of the Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress.
The foreign ministers are working here to meet a challenge to our peace and freedom.
That meeting is still in session, so I must announce to you that I shall confine myself to the hope that in the spirit of the hemisphere, a sound and, I believe, an effective answer will be found.
These four problems are not the only ones that we have to deal with in the world today.
There are many, many others, such as dangers in Cyprus, and disturbances in the Congo, and difficulty in the Kennedy Round.
But we still work for peace in Cyprus and in the Congo and for progress in the Kennedy Round.
We are a steadfast people in the United States, and in the larger sense the world is less dangerous, and we are stronger than we were 4 years ago, so our work for peace must go on and will go on with success, I believe.
I understand that we have with us today a group of journalists from Latin America who are here to cover the meeting of the foreign ministers.
I want to extend to them a very cordial welcome.
Now I am ready to answer any questions you may have.
I receive detailed reports at the close of each day with regard to the investigations that have been carried on by the Federal Bureau of investigation.
I do not care to comment in detail on those reports until some conclusions have been reached and some recommendations made, and until I think it is more appropriate to do so.
I would not hesitate to say that the impression I gain from reading those reports is that there are extremist elements involved, and at the appropriate time I think that their identity will be made known.
Senator Goldwater, through the facilities of his office, asked the legislative representative of the White House for an opportunity to meet with the President, and on an unpublicized basis.
We informed the White House representative that we would be glad to meet with Senator Goldwater.
We have met with Senators every day, and we would certainly be glad to meet with him any time that he thought a meeting would be useful.
The 5:30 arrangement today was made.
I cannot anticipate all the subjects that will come up, but I am very glad to talk to him and will try to be responsive and make the meeting as fruitful as possible.
I think I have already done that.
I pointed out that we had already had one conference, and that we would carry out the agreements reached at that conference table, that there would be no need of our presence there, but until there is demonstrated upon the part of those who are ignoring the agreements reached at the conference table, some desire to carry out their agreement, we expect to continue our efforts in Viet-Nam.
Well, I think there should be complete understanding and confidence in this country and among all our friends abroad.
The control of nuclear weapons is one of the most solemn responsibilities of the President of the United Statesthe man who is President can never get away from that responsibility and can never forget it.
The American people rely on his good judgment.
They want that authority vested in a civilian.
They do not expect to abandon this duty to military men in the field, and I do not think they have ever seriously considered that since the Founding Fathers drafted our Constitution.
I, myself, give close and continual attention to maintaining the most effective possible command and control over these awesome weapons.
I believe that the final responsibility for all decisions on nuclear weapons must rest with the civilian head of this Governmentthe President of the United Statesand I think and reiterate that I believe that is the way the American people want it.
We are going to be as cooperative and as helpful as we can in an attempt to see that the people of that area have as good a government as is possible, and we have every intention of being understanding and cooperative.
Well, I would say to the architect of this meeting this afternoon that I do not believe that any issue which is before the people can be eliminated from the campaign in a free society in an election year.
After all, that is the purpose of elections, is to discuss the issues.
If candidates differ on important questions, it is up to the electors who must choose between them and in order to be able to satisfactorily choose between them, they must hear their views.
Now, I believe that all men and women are entitled to their full constitutional rights, regardless of their ancestry or their religion or the region of the country in which they may live.
I believe that disputes, no matter how bitter, should be settled in the courts and not in the streets.
I made that statement many times in press conferences and speeches over the country in the last several years.
That is the reason that after more than two-thirds of the Democrats in the Congress approved the civil rights bill, and some 80 percent of the Republicans in the Senate supported the civil rights bill, I signed the civil rights bill.
I believe that all men and women are entitled to equal opportunity so that they can be judged according to their merits and not according to some artificial barrier.
Now, to the extent that Senator Goldwater differs from these views, or the Republican Party differs, there will, of course, be discussion.
I intend to carry on some of it, if I am a candidate.
The test of a free society is that it discusses and resolves these issues intelligently.
It does not sweep them under the rug when they become difficult.
I propose to discuss and debate the hard and difficult issues in the spirit of attempting to resolve them, and on the assumption that the American people are willing to listen and are intelligent and are unafraid.
No word or deed of mine, that I am aware of, has everor I hope will everlend any aid or any comfort to this small minority who would take the law into their own hands for whatever cause or whatever excuse they may use.
If Senator Goldwater and his advisers, and his followers, will follow the same course that I intend to follow, and that I expect the Democratic Party to follow, which is a course of rebuffing and rebuking bigots and those who seek to excite and exploit tensions, then it will be most welcome and I think it will be a very fine contribution to our political life in America.
Can you speak a little louder? No, we have no plans along that line.
Over the past several years I have heard rumors to that effect, and have seen news stories making predictions along that line, but we have no plans at the present time for any such action.
Most campaigns are rough campaigns.
I am an old campaigner.
I have been at it 30 years.
One of the first things I learned, at least so far as I am concerned, is the people are not much interested in my personal opinion of my opponent.
Well, you have asked two questions there.
First, there is no such suggestion at all.
I am not unhappy.
I hope I do not look unhappy.
I do not feel unhappy.
I do not know who suggested that to you.
But the question was raised that it was unpublicized, and knowing the initiative and ingenuity of the American press, I did not think it would be unpublicized very long.
I just suggested that it was rather difficult for a fellow to take a glass of water at the White House, or even go out to the hydrant and get a drink, without it being adequately publicized.
I cannot even visit with my dogs without a lot of publicity.
So I am not unhappy about it at all.
I just explained that I thought it would be better to put it on the record, and so far as I know, Senator Goldwater is perfectly happy with it.
There is no breach of faith on his part and certainly none on my part.
I realize that someone might indicate, because the suggestion in all its entirety was not carried out, there might be some difficulty between us, but my object in life has always been to not provoke fights, but to prevent them, if possible.
I think that their viewpoint is the same as the viewpoint of their Government.
I think, generally speaking, that viewpoint is being considered by the foreign ministers who are meeting here now.
I believe that they all recognize the challenge to peace and freedom which exists, and the necessity for not only being aware of that challenge but attempting to combat it with every reasonable and wise means available.
I believe out of this meeting the hemisphere will find a sound and effective answer, and I think that there are some indications now that the policies that we have pursued heretofore and the ones that we are suggesting be followed now are being effective.
Well, I am against sin, and I am against lawlessness, and I am very much opposed to violence.
I think we have to put a stop to it.
To the extent that we have the power to do so, in the Federal Government, we are doing so.
We are exerting every action we know to keep violence to a minimum.
We do not have a national police force in this country, we have not assumed power that we do not have, and we do not intend to.
But wherever there is violence, we respond to it within the limits of our power and our authority.
We do have confidence in the local authorities.
We do respect the sovereign States and the executives of those States.
We have communicated with the mayors and the Governors and have made available to them all the facilities of the Federal Government to cooperate with them and work effectively with them.
We will continue to do so.
We deplore men taking the law into their own hands and men disregarding the law, wherever it takes place.
We treat them all alike.
I do not think there is any doubt in anyone's mind in the United States that the President of the United States, the power of the Presidency and the people of the United States are going to do everything within their power and within their authority to stop violence wherever it appears.
But our judgement is that it is not up to us to take over the authority of all the local governments and not up to us to take over the authority of all the State governments.
I seem to have read and heard that other people, too, are opposed to the Federal Government usurping the rights of the States.
The answer is no.
I stated that earlier, but I repeat it.
I think what I think about Senator Goldwater and my prediction as to the outcome of the race is not very important.
I think that is a matter for the American people to decide.
I think what the people want to know is how I stand on issues, and what my policies will be, and what my party stands for.
They are much more interested in what the Democratic nominee advocates than what he thinks about his opponent or his chances of winning.
I have every confidence that the Democratic Party will adopt a good platform, will select good candidates, and that they will present their views to the people without regard to personalities, and the people, in their wisdom, will make a good decision.
Yes.
Yes, I am not concerned with Senator Goldwater's opinion of me.
Of course, I would like for it to be a good opinion, but if it is not, that is a matter for him.
He is entitled to his view and he has the right to express it, if he thinks it is a proper thing to do and a wise thing to do.
The American people will make their judgments of the various statements that he may make from time to time.
I am perfectly willing to leave his opinion of me to the judgment of the people of this country.
I have been rather busily engaged the last few days and I have not spent a great deal of time evaluating that situation.
I do not know how much support Governor Wallace had.
I do not know how it would affect the platforms and the nominees of the two parties.
All I know is that he decided to withdraw.
I had heard and anticipated that he would do that.
He confirmed it.
But what effect it will have in November, I do not know.
Whatever I think is wise and necessary, and I expect to appear in various parts of the country and be very concerned with seeing that my party and my platform and the views of my candidates are properly presented.
I will make whatever contribution I can, consistent with discharging my other duties, and try to be as helpful to the ticket as possible at all times.
No, I said that we get reports from there every evening.
I do not think there is any question but what there are some extremist elements involved in the violence that takes place there.
I think that must be evident to everyone who reads the newspapers.
So far as we are concerned, we are prepared to take whatever action may be ' necessary and desirable.
We have  Hoover keeping very close watch on it.
He has an adequate supply of manpower available to him.
He has them assigned on specific investigations at the moment, and we will follow it very closely and do whatever needs to be done.
Well, we will cross that bridge when we get to it.
I think foreign policy is an appropriate subject for discussion.
I think the people of this country really need no advice from anyone else in other parts of the world about the decision they should make, but I think they will certainly want to be sure that the foreign policy of their country is a proper one, and I am prepared to present the views of my party on that subject and will do so at such time and at such length as may be desirable.
I will leave that up to the judgment of the people and you.
I do not want to be passing personal judgment on the acts of another individual.
I have given you my viewpoint on it.
That is a little mission you will have to do for yourself.
I think that the American people are perfectly capable of making their own decision with regard to the parties and the candidates, and I think that they will do that without the necessity of advice from anyone abroad.
Thank you,  President.
My fellow Americans:As President and Commander in Chief, it is my duty to the American people to report that renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action in reply.
The initial attack on the destroyer 'Maddox, on August 2, was repeated today by a number of hostile vessels attacking two U.
S.
destroyers with torpedoes.
The destroyers and supporting aircraft acted at once on the orders I gave after the initial act of aggression.
We believe at least two of the attacking boats were sunk.
There were no U.
S.
losses.
The performance of commanders and crews in this engagement is in the highest tradition of the United States Navy.
But repeated acts of violence against the Armed Forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply.
That reply is being given as I speak to you tonight.
Air action is now in execution against gunboats and certain supporting facilities in North Viet-Nam which have been used in these hostile operations.
In the larger sense this new act of aggression, aimed directly at our own forces, again brings home to all of us in the United States the importance of the struggle for peace and security in southeast Asia.
Aggression by terror against the peaceful villagers of South Viet-Nam has now been joined by open aggression on the high seas against the United States of America.
The determination of all Americans to carry out our full commitment to the people and to the government of South Viet-Nam will be redoubled by this outrage.
Yet our response, for the present, will be limited and fitting.
We Americans know, although others appear to forget, the risks of spreading conflict.
We still seek no wider war.
I have instructed the Secretary of State to make this position totally clear to friends and to adversaries and, indeed, to all.
I have instructed Ambassador Stevenson to raise this matter immediately and urgently before the Security Council of the United Nations.
Finally, I have today met with the leaders of both parties in the Congress of the United States and I have informed them that I shall immediately request the Congress to pass a resolution making it clear that our Government is united in its determination to take all necessary measures in support of freedom and in defense of peace in southeast Asia.
I have been given encouraging assurance by these leaders of both parties that such a resolution will be promptly introduced, freely and expeditiously debated, and passed with overwhelming support.
And just a few minutes ago I was able to reach Senator Goldwater and I am glad to say that he has expressed his support of the statement that I am making to you tonight.
It is a solemn responsibility to have to order even limited military action by forces whose overall strength is as vast and as awesome as those of the United States of America, but it is my considered conviction, shared throughout your Government, that firmness in the right is indispensable today for peace; that firmness will always be measured.
Its mission is peace.
My fellow Americans:I am about to sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
I want to take this occasion to talk to you about what that law means to every American.
One hundred and eighty-eight years ago this week a small band of valiant men began a long struggle for freedom.
They pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor not only to found a nation, but to forge an ideal of freedom  not only for political independence, but for personal liberty  not only to eliminate foreign rule, but to establish the rule of justice in the affairs of men.
That struggle was a turning point in our history.
Today in far corners of distant continents, the ideals of those American patriots still shape the struggles of men who hunger for freedom.
This is a proud triumph.
Yet those who founded our country knew that freedom would be secure only if each generation fought to renew and enlarge its meaning.
From the minutemen at Concord to the soldiers in Viet-Nam, each generation has been equal to that trust.
Americans of every race and color have died in battle to protect our freedom.
Americans of every race and color have worked to build a nation of widening opportunities.
Now our generation of Americans has been called on to continue the unending search for justice within our own borders.
We believe that all men are created equal.
Yet many are denied equal treatment.
We believe that all men have certain unalienable rights.
Yet many Americans do not enjoy those rights.
We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings of liberty.
Yet millions are being deprived of those blessings  not because of their own failures, but because of the color of their skin.
The reasons are deeply imbedded in history and tradition and the nature of man.
We can understand  without rancor or hatred  how this all happened.
But it cannot continue.
Our Constitution, the foundation of our Republic, forbids it.
The principles of our freedom forbid it.
Morality forbids it.
And the law I will sign tonight forbids it.
That law is the product of months of the most careful debate and discussion.
It was proposed more than one year ago by our late and beloved President John F.
Kennedy.
It received the bipartisan support of more than two-thirds of the Members of both the House and the Senate.
An overwhelming majority of Republicans as well as Democrats voted for it.
It has received the thoughtful support of tens of thousands of civic and religious leaders in all parts of this Nation.
And it is supported by the great majority of the American people.
The purpose of the law is simple.
It does not restrict the freedom of any American, so long as he respects the rights of others.
It does not give special treatment to any citizen.
It does say the only limit to a man's hope for happiness, and for the future of his children, shall be his own ability.
It does say that there are those who are equal before God shall now also be equal in the polling booths, in the classrooms, in the factories, and in hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and other places that provide service to the public.
I am taking steps to implement the law under my constitutional obligation to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.
First, I will send to the Senate my nomination of LeRoy Collins to be Director of the Community Relations Service.
Governor Collins will bring the experience of a long career of distinguished public service to the task of helping communities solve problems of human relations through reason and commonsense.
Second, I shall appoint an advisory committee of distinguished Americans to assist Governor Collins in his assignment.
Third, I am sending Congress a request for supplemental appropriations to pay for necessary costs of implementing the law, and asking for immediate action.
Fourth, already today in a meeting of my Cabinet this afternoon I directed the agencies of this Government to fully discharge the new responsibilities imposed upon them by the law and to do it without delay, and to keep me personally informed of their progress.
Fifth, I am asking appropriate officials to meet with representative groups to promote greater understanding of the law and to achieve a spirit of compliance.
We must not approach the observance and enforcement of this law in a vengeful spirit.
Its purpose is not to punish.
Its purpose is not to divide, but to end divisions  divisions which have all lasted too long.
Its purpose is national, not regional.
Its purpose is to promote a more abiding commitment to freedom, a more constant pursuit of justice, and a deeper respect for human dignity.
We will achieve these goals because most Americans are law-abiding citizens who want to do what is right.
This is why the Civil Rights Act relies first on voluntary compliance, then on the efforts of local communities and States to secure the rights of citizens.
It provides for the national authority to step in only when others cannot or will not do the job.
This Civil Rights Act is a challenge to all of us to go to work in our communities and our States, in our homes and in our hearts, to eliminate the last vestiges of injustice in our beloved country.
So tonight I urge every public official, every religious leader, every business and professional man, every workingman, every housewife  I urge every American  to join in this effort to bring justice and hope to all our people  and to bring peace to our land.
My fellow citizens, we have come now to a time of testing.
We must not fail.
Let us close the springs of racial poison.
Let us pray for wise and understanding hearts.
Let us lay aside irrelevant differences and make our Nation whole.
Let us hasten that day when our unmeasured strength and our unbounded spirit will be free to do the great works ordained for this Nation by the just and wise God who is the Father of us all.
Thank you and good night.
Newhouse, Chancellor Tolley, Governor and  Rockefeller, Members of the Congress, distinguished guests, members of the faculty, ladies and gentlemen: I know that you share with me the great admiration and pride that the generosity of  Newhouse has made possible for this area of our Nation and for this great institution.
We all are in his debt, and in the years and generations and centuries to come, we will see the products of this great adventure.
On this occasion, it is fitting, I think, that we are meeting here to dedicate this new center to better understanding among all men.
For that is my purpose in speaking to you.
Last night I spoke to the people of the Nation.
This morning, I speak to the people of all nationsso that they may understand without mistake our purpose in the action that we have been required to take.
On August 2 the United States destroyer Maddox was attacked on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin by hostile vessels of the Government of North Viet-Nam.
On August 4 that attack was repeated in those same waters against two United States destroyers.
The attacks were deliberate.
The attacks were unprovoked.
The attacks have been answered.
Throughout last night and within the last 12 hours, air units of the United States Seventh Fleet have sought out the hostile vessels and certain of their supporting facilities.
Appropriate armed action has been taken against them.
The United States is now asking that this be brought immediately and urgently before the Security Council of the United Nations.
We welcomeand we invitethe scrutiny of all men who seek peace, for peace is the only purpose of the course that America pursues.
The Gulf of Tonkin may be distant, but none can be detached about what has happened there.
Aggressiondeliberate, willful, and systematic aggressionhas unmasked its face to the entire world.
The world remembers-the world must never forgetthat aggression unchallenged is aggression unleashed.
We of the United States have not forgotten.
That is why we have answered this aggression with action.
America's course is not precipitate.
America's course is not without long provocation.
For 10 years three American Presidents-President Eisenhower, President Kennedy, and your present Presidentand the American people have been actively concerned with threats to the peace and security of the peoples of southeast Asia from the Communist government of North Viet-Nam.
President Eisenhower soughtand President Kennedy soughtthe same objectives that I still seek: That the governments of southeast Asia honor the international agreements which apply in the area;That those governments leave each other alone;That they resolve their differences peacefully;That they devote their talents to bettering the lives of their peoples by working against poverty and disease and ignorance.
In 1954 we made our position clear toward Viet-Nam.
In June of that year we stated we would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the 1954 agreements with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security.
In September of that year the United States signed the Manila pact on which our participation in SEATO is based.
That pact recognized that aggression by means of armed attack on South Viet-Nam would endanger the peace and the safety of the nations signing that solemn agreement.
In 1962 we made our position clear toward Laos.
We signed the Declaration of Neutrality of Laos.
That accord provided for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and respect for the neutrality and independence of that little country.
The agreements of 1954 and 1962 were also signed by the government of North Viet-Nam.
In 1954 that government pledged that it would respect the territory under the military control of the other party and engage in no hostile act against the other party.
In 1962 that government pledged that it would not introduce into the Kingdom of Laos foreign troops or military personnel.
That government also pledged that it would not use the territory of the Kingdom of Laos for interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
That government of North Viet-Nam is now willfully and systematically violating those agreements of both 1954 and 1962.
To the south it is engaged in aggression against the Republic of Viet-Nam.
To the west it is engaged in aggression against the Kingdom of Laos.
To the east it has now struck out on the high seas in an act of aggression against the United States of America.
There can be, there must be no doubt about the policy and no doubt about the purpose.
So there can be no doubt about the responsibilities of men and the responsibilities of nations that are devoted to peace.
Peace cannot be assured merely by assuring the safety of the United States destroyer Maddox or the safety of other vessels of other flags.
Peace requires that the existing agreements in the area be honored.
Peace requires that we and all our friends stand firm against the present aggressions of the government of North Viet-Nam.
The government of North Viet-Nam is today flouting the will of the world for peace.
The world is challenged to make its will against war known and to make it known clearly and to make it felt and to make it felt decisively.
So, to our friends of the Atlantic Alliance, let me say this, this morning: the challenge that we face in southeast Asia today is the same challenge that we have faced with courage and that we have met with strength in Greece and Turkey, in Berlin and Korea, in Lebanon and in Cuba.
And to any who may be tempted to support or to widen the present aggression I say this: there is no threat to any peaceful power from the United States of America.
But there can be no peace by aggression and no immunity from reply.
That is what is meant by the actions that we took yesterday.
Finally, my fellow Americans, I would like to say to ally and adversary alike: let no friend needlessly fearand no foe vainly hopethat this is a nation divided in this election year.
Our free electionsour full and free debateare America's strength, not America's weakness.
There are no parties and there is no partisanship when our peace or the peace of the world is imperiled by aggressors in any part of the world.
We are one nation united and indivisible.
And united and indivisible we shall remain.
Chairman McCormack, my fellow Americans: I accept your nomination.
I accept the duty of leading this party to victory this year.
And I thank you, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for placing at my side the man that last night you so wisely selected to be the next Vice President of the United States.
I know I speak for each of you and all of you when I say he proved himself tonight in that great acceptance speech.
And I speak for both of us when I tell you that from Monday on he is going to be available for such speeches in all 50 States!We will try to lead you as we were led by that great champion of freedom, the man from Independence, Harry S.
Truman.
But the gladness of this high occasion cannot mask the sorrow which shares our hearts.
So let us here tonight, each of us, all of us, rededicate ourselves to keeping burning the golden torch of promise which John Fitzgerald Kennedy set aflame.
And let none of us stop to rest until we have written into the law of the land all the suggestions that made up the John Fitzgerald Kennedy program.
And then let us continue to supplement that program with the kind of laws that he would have us write.
Tonight we offer ourselveson our record and by our platformas a party for all Americans, an all-American party for all Americans.
This prosperous people, this land of reasonable men, has no place for petty partisanship or peevish prejudice.
The needs of all can never be met by parties of the few.
The needs of all cannot be met by a business party or a labor party, not by a war party or a peace party, not by a southern party or a northern party.
Our deeds will meet our needs only if we are served by a party which serves all our people.
We are members together of such a party, the Democratic Party of 1964.
We have written a proud record of accomplishments for all Americans.
If any ask what we have done, just let them look at what we promised to do.
For those promises have become our deeds.
And the promises of tonight I can assure you will become the deeds of tomorrow.
We are in the midst of the largest and the longest period of peacetime prosperity in our history.
And almost every American listening to us tonight has seen the results in his own life.
But prosperity for most has not brought prosperity to all.
And those who have received the bounty of this landwho sit tonight secure in affluence and safe in power-must not now turn from the needs of their neighbors.
Our party and our Nation will continue to extend the hand of compassion and the hand of affection and love to the old and the sick and the hungry.
For who among us dares to betray the command: Thou shalt open thine handunto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
The needs that we seek to fill, the hopes that we seek to realize, are not our needs, our hopes alone.
They are the needs and hopes of most of the people.
Most Americans want medical care for older citizens.
And so do I.
Most Americans want fair and stable prices and decent incomes for our farmers.
And so do I.
Most Americans want a decent home in a decent neighborhood for all.
And so do I.
Most Americans want an education for every child to the limit of his ability.
And so do I.
Most Americans want a job for every man who wants to work.
And so do I.
Most Americans want victory in our war against poverty.
And so do I.
Most Americans want continually expanding and growing prosperity.
And so do I.
These are your goals.
These are our goals.
These are the goals and will be the achievements of the Democratic Party.
These are the goals of this great, rich Nation.
These are the goals toward which I will lead, if the American people choose to follow.
For 30 years, year by year, step by step, vote by vote, men of both parties have built a solid foundation for our present prosperity.
Too many have worked too long and too hard to see this threatened now by policies which promise to undo all that we have done together over all these years.
I believe most of the men and women in this hall tonight, and I believe most Americans, understand that to reach our goals in our own land, we must work for peace among all lands.
America's cause is still the cause of all mankind.
Over the last 4 years the world has begun to respond to a simple American belief: the belief that strength and courage and responsibility are the keys to peace.
Since 1961, under the leadership of that great President, John F.
Kennedy, we have carried out the greatest peacetime buildup of national strength of any nation at any time in the history of the world.
I report tonight that we have spent $30 billion more on preparing this Nation in the 4 years of the Kennedy administration than would have been spent if we had followed the appropriations of the last year of the previous administration.
I report tonight as President of the United States and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces on the strength of your country, and I tell you that it is greater than any adversary.
I assure you that it is greater than the combined might of all the nations, in all the wars, in all the history of this planet.
And I report our superiority is growing.
Weapons do not make peace.
Men make peace.
And peace comes not through strength alone, but through wisdom and patience and restraint.
And these qualities under the leadership of President Kennedy brought a treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere.
And a hundred other nations in the world joined us.
Other agreements were reached and other steps were taken.
And their single guide was to lessen the danger to men without increasing the danger to freedom.
Their single purpose was peace in the world.
And as a result of these policies, the world tonight knows where we stand and our allies know where we stand, too.
And our adversaries have learned again that we will never waver in the defense of freedom.
The true courage of this nuclear age lies in the quest for peace.
There is no place in today's world for weakness.
But there is also no place in today's world for recklessness.
We cannot act rashly with the nuclear weapons that could destroy us all.
The only course is to press with all our mind and all our will to make sure, doubly sure, that these weapons are never really used at all.
This is a dangerous and a difficult world in which we live tonight.
I promise no easy answers.
But I do promise this.
I pledge the firmness to defend freedom, the strength to support that firmness, and a constant, patient effort to move the world toward peace instead of war.
And here at home one of our greatest responsibilities is to assure fair play for all of our people.
Every American has the right to be treated as a 'person.
He should be able to find a job.
He should be able to educate his children, he should be able to vote in elections and he should be judged on his merits as a person.
Well, this is the fixed policy and the fixed determination of the Democratic Party and the United States of America.
So long as I am your President I intend to carry out what the Constitution demandsand justice requiresequal justice under law for all Americans.
We cannot and we will not allow this great purpose to be endangered by reckless acts of violence.
Those who break the lawthose who create disorderwhether in the North or the Southmust be caught and must be brought to justice.
And I believe that every man and woman in this room tonight join me in saying that in every part of this country the law must be respected and violence must be stopped.
And wherever a local officer seeks help or Federal law is broken, I have pledged and I will use the full resources of the Federal Government.
Let no one tell you that he can hold back progress and at the same time keep the peace.
This is a false and empty promise.
To stand in the way of orderly progress is to encourage violence.
And I say tonight to those who wish us welland to those who wish us illthe growing forces in this country are the forces of common human decency, and not the forces of bigotry and fear and smear.
Our problems are many and are great.
But our opportunities are even greater.
And let me make this clear.
I ask the American people for a mandatenot to preside over a finished programnot just to keep things going, I ask the American people for a mandate to begin.
This Nationthis generationin this hour, has man's first chance to build the Great Societya place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor.
We seek a nation where every man can find reward in work and satisfaction in the use of his talents.
We seek a nation where every man can seek knowledge, and touch beauty, and rejoice in the closeness of family and community.
We seek a nation where every man can, in the words of our oldest promise, follow the pursuit of happinessnot just security-but achievements and excellence and fulfillment of the spirit.
So let us join together in this great task.
Will you join me tonight in rebuilding our cities to make them a decent place for our children to live in?Will you join me tonight in starting a program that will protect the beauty of our land and the air that we breathe ?Won't you join me tonight in starting a program that will give every child education of the highest quality that he can take?So let us join together in giving every American the fullest life which he can hope for.
For the ultimate test of our civilization, the ultimate test of our faithfulness to our past, is not in our goods and is not in our guns.
It is in the qualitythe quality of our people's lives and in the men and women that we produce.
This goal can be ours.
We have the resources; we have the knowledge.
But tonight we must seek the courage.
Because tonight the contest is the same that we have faced at every turning point in history.
It is not between liberals and conservatives, it is not between party and party, or platform and platform.
It is between courage and timidity.
It is between those who have vision and those who see what can be, and those who want only to maintain the status quo.
It is between those who welcome the future and those who turn away from its promises.
This is the true cause of freedom.
The man who is hungry, who cannot find work or educate his children, who is bowed by wantthat man is not fully free.
For more than 30 years, from social security to the war against poverty, we have diligently worked to enlarge the freedom of man.
And as a result, Americans tonight are freer to live as they want to live, to.
pursue their ambitions, to meet their desires, to raise their families than at any time in all of our glorious history.
And every American knows in his heart that this is right.
I am determined in all the time that is mine to use all the talents that I have for bringing this great, lovable land, this great Nation of ours, togethertogether in greater unity in pursuit of this common purpose.
I truly believe that we someday will see an America that knows no North or South, no East or Westan America that is undivided by creed or color, and untorn by suspicion or strife.
The Founding Fathers dreamed America before it was.
The pioneers dreamed of great cities on the wilderness that they crossed.
Our tomorrow is on its way.
It can be a shape of darkness or it can be a thing of beauty.
The choice is ours, it is yours, for it will be the dream that we dare to dream.
I know what kind of a dream Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S.
Truman and John F.
Kennedy would dream if they were here tonight.
And I think that I know what kind of a dream you want to dream.
Tonight we of the Democratic Party confidently go before the people offering answers, not retreat; offering unity, not division; offering hope, not fear or smear.
We do offer the people a choice, a choice of continuing on the courageous and the compassionate course that has made this Nation the strongest and the freest and the most prosperous and the most peaceful nation in the history of mankind.
To those who have sought to divide us they have only helped to unite us.
To those who would provoke us we have turned the other cheek.
So as we conclude our labors, let us tomorrow turn to our new task.
Let us be on our way!Chairman McCormack, my fellow Americans: I accept your nomination.
I accept the duty of leading this party to victory this year.
And I thank you, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for placing at my side the man that last night you so wisely selected to be the next Vice President of the United States.

Chairman; Governor McKeithen; your great senior Senator Allen Ellender, my old friend; your fine mayor, Mayor Schiro;  Long; my longtime and my valued friend and colleague, one of the most promising young men in this Nation, Russell Long; Congressman Willis, Congressman Morrison, Congressman Thompson, Congressman Gillis Longall of whom serve this Nation and this State with great distinction and with credit to Louisiana and the Congress;  Marshall Brown;  Donelonall my friends in Louisiana:You have touched me with your generosity and your cordiality.
I deeply appreciate the very fine welcome that you gave Lady Bird and Luci when they came in this evening.
Every 4 years we seem to have a habit of coming home to New Orleans, and ending our trip on a whistle-stop in this lovely, enterprising city.
I, through the years, have always felt close to the people of Louisiana because I was born and reared in an adjoining State, in a neighboring State.
I have, as Russell said, spent some time in the Congress, and through those almost 30 years there the Louisiana representatives have always been fair, and just, and effective.
I would much rather have them with me than against me, and I have had them both ways.
Finallyafter having opposed Russell on two or three items, on various amendments, on my bill, just before they got ready to pass them, he would get up and offer an amendment and take that left hand and talk Senators into voting for itI finally just told the Secretary of the Senate that I was going to start voting for Russell's amendments-it was easier to join him than to fight him.
And I have been doing that through the years now, and I have been signing his bills.
Senator Ellender gets me to do nearly everything he wants me to without any pilon or lagniappe.
But when the going gets tough and he just really has to move heaven and earth, he will put on one of those good feeds of his and he will bring up some of this New Orleans candy that he makes, that we call pralines.
I thought he just reserved it for myself until the other day when I went over to have lunch at the White House and the table was empty, with just one plate there.
I said, Where in the world is  Johnson? And they said, She is up eating with Senator Ellender.
I said, How long has she been gone? And they said, About 15 minutes.
So I put on my hat and invited myself.
f went up there and I was the only man there except Allen, and he had all the pretty women in Washington up there in the room eating with him!So this Louisiana delegation is something that I am very proud of, something that I have enjoyed working with.
And I want to remind the people in New Orleans and all Louisiana what  Rayburn said one time when they asked him why Texas had such a good, effective delegation in the Congress.
He said, Well, we pick them young, and we pick them honest.
We send them there, and we keep them there.
The last 4 days I have followed that train trip through every yard of the South, and I have called three or four times a day myself just to see how everything was getting along.
I do not need to tell you what great pride I have had in my wife and in my daughters and, most of all, in their affection for the people of their homeland and their willingness to come out and stand up on their tiptoes and look them straight in the eyes and tell them what they thought of them and how much we cared and how much we needed them.
And I particularly appreciate the way you have reciprocated here in Louisiana.
Now, on this occasion, at the close of this week of our campaign, there ought to be grateful pride in the heart of every American.
On the main streets of America, history is being made.
From Maine to California, from the Midwest to the Deep South, the people of America are coming out.
And they are coming out to stand up and be counted for their country.
On the streets of all sections we are seeing the largest crowds that we have ever seen in any election period.
You know, and I think I know, what this means, and if you do not know what it means, I am going to tell you what it means.
Our cause is no longer the cause of a party alone.
Our cause is the cause of a great Nation.
Our cause is the cause of the country that you love.
Our cause is the country that you would die for, and the people are laying down their partisanship.
They are asking us to take up their trust.
They are asking us to keep this Nation prosperous.
They are asking us to keep this Nation progressive.
They are asking us to keep this country, and all the world, at peace.
The party of the people will not fail the trust of the people.
And our first trust is victory, itself, on November 3d, and that is what we are going to have.
Too much that is precious, too much that we prize, too much that is part of America itself is at stake for any Democrat, anyone who takes pride in being a Democrat, to rest these next 24 days.
This year, as in no year before, you work not as partisans for party, but you work as Americans for America.
If victory is our first trust, no less a trust is the margin by which that victory is won.
If our position in the world is not to be weakened, if we are to spare ourselves wasteful years of antagonism and division, and animosity here at home, the American people on November 3d must give a decisive reply that will be understood and heard throughout the world.
And make no mistake about it, the spotlight of the world is on you November 3d.
When victory is oursfor our country, not for ourselvesI want it to mean a mandate for beginning a new era in American affairs, an era of courage, an era of commonsense, and an era of American confidence.
When the next President takes the oath of office next year, it will be 20 years since the end of World War II When that war ended, you remember and I have not forgotten what we were told.
Voices at home, and voices abroad, predicted:That depression would be inevitable.
That communism would be irresistible.
That war would be unavoidable.
And the American people listened and heard, but refused to accept those doctrines.
In hope, in faith, in confidence, we took our stand.
In the Full Employment Act of 1946 America made a commitment against depression-and made a commitment for prosperityhere at home.
In the Truman doctrine and the Marshall plan of 1948 we made our commitment against the spread of communism and for the strength of freedom throughout the world.
In all that we did, we honored our oldest commitment as a Nation and as a people, against war and for peace.
The years have been long.
The trials have been many.
The burdens have been great.
But the times are beginning to respond to America's steadfast purpose.
This administration is the first in a century not to experience a recession or a depression.
This administration is the first since midcentury under which no Nation in the world has fallen to communism.
This administration is the first of the postwar age to offer a record not only of peace preserved but of peace courageously and effectively pursued.
What the American people set out to do is coming true.
Others would have you believe that prosperity is false.
Well, ask yourselves or your wife when you go home tonight if that is true.
You know it is real.
Others would have you believe that freedom is faltering, but you know that you are freer now than you were when you were 21.
And the yoke of dictatorship and the yoke of colonialism is being thrown off of nations all around the world, and new nations are being born, and independence and freedom are on the march.
Others would have you believe that the pursuit of peace is unworthy work, but you know it is the most noble work that any nation can do.
The point that I am making is simply this: The meaning of our victory in November will be just thisto assure this confident people of leadership with confidence to match their own.
There is work to do, and we can either do it together, united, or we can do it divided, eating on each other.
The platform on which I stand says: The Federal Government exists not to grow larger, but to enlarge the individual potential and achievement of the people.
The Federal Government exists not to subordinate the States, but to support them.
I quote the words, but I might offer them as my own, for those words I wrote into the platform.
Those words are my beliefs and they have been my beliefs all my life.
For so long as I serve in the White House, your Government will be dedicated not to encroaching upon the rights of the States, but to helping the States meet their responsibilities to their own people.
Let me be specific.
If we are to heal our history and make this Nation whole, prosperity must know no Mason-Dixon line and opportunity must know no color line.
Robert E.
Lee, a great son of the South, a great leader of the Southand I assume no modern day leader would question him or challenge himRobert E.
Lee counseled us well when he told us to cast off our animosities, and raise our sons to be Americans.
From the tip of Texas to the tip of Florida, this crescent of the Gulf offers one of the great opportunities of the Western World.
I want to see that opportunity fulfilled.
I want us to wipe poverty off the face of the Southand off the conscience of the Nation.
I want us to assure our young the best of education at every level, and the expectation of a good job in their home State when their school years are through.
I want us to assure our aged that when they need hospital care they will have it, and they will have paid for it in advance, by themselves, and with the help of their employers, under social security.
I may turn out the lights in the White House chandeliers but I am determined that no one will turn out the lights of the REA in the farmhouses of Louisiana.
I so much want us to maintain a prosperous, free enterprise economy, so your Governor can continue bringing in new plants and new payrolls and new jobs in the north and in the south of your State.
Yes, I see a day, and I know that you see it, too, when New Orleans will stand as a Queen City on this crescent.
A center of trade with the world.
A center of culture for the Nation.
A terminal for waterways reaching the heart of America.
A port for the spaceships that are returning from outer space.
A good and gracious city for your families to call their home.
We are not going to lose that tomorrow in divisions over things of the past.
For all America, that will be the meaning of the victory that we seek November 3d.
We are going to show the courage to unite America, the commonsense to keep America strong and prepared, and the confidence to seek after peace for the lives of our own people and the lives of all mankind.
Courage, commonsense, and confidencethose are the qualities that will serve our country's cause, and in this election our country's cause is the cause that we are determined to carry to victory.
When I became Democratic leader after General Eisenhower had sent the party of which I was a member to a terrible defeat in 1952, I told the Members of the Senate who were in the Democratic caucus that I was a free man first, an American second, a Senator third, and a Democrat fourth, in that order; that when my President was right and when he spoke for all America and when he sought to unite us against a common enemy, he would have my support.
When I thought he was wrong, I would oppose him with decency and dignity, and I would give him my reasons for it, and I would try to suggest an alternative.
But I would never personally attack him or assassinate him or talk about his wife or his children or his dogs.
I kept that pledge, and for 8 years I served as leader of the Senate during a period that we had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress.
And every election, every 2 years, they rewarded us by increasing my majority.
The people of America want public servants in America to do what is best for their country first, and if they do what is best for their country, they will do what is best for themselves.
When I was called upon in a matter of moments to assume the awesome responsibilities of the Presidency following that tragic day in Dallas, I said to the people of this Nation and the world that with God's help and with your prayers I will do my deadlevel best.
I have done that.
I have spent long hours, I have worked hard, I have worked with a clear conscience, I have done everything that I could with the talents that the good Lord gave me to try to unite this country and to try to have peace in the world.
We had a crisis in Panama a few days after I went in and they shot our soldiers.
We had a crisis in Guantanamo, and some of our people in the country hollered, Let's send the Marines in, and I said, No, we will send the admiral in to cut the water off instead of a Marine in to turn it on.
We had our ships fired on in the Tonkin Gulf, and we made a prompt reply, an appropriate reply.
But we have never lost our heart and I hope we will never lose our head.
We are going to keep our eyes in the stars, but we are going to keep our feet on the ground.
I think it is a wonderful thing for Louisiana to do, to give us this dinner tonight.
I am proud of your delegation.
I am especially grateful to Hale and Lindy Boggs and Tommy for all the hard work and days that they spent with Lady Bird, Luci, and Lynda, helping them through these States that we love.
I do not want to conclude this talk, though, without telling you that some of my political philosophy was born in this State.
As a young secretary, I came to New Orleans before I ever went to Washington.
I saw something about the political history of Louisiana.
And I saw a man who was frequently praised, and a man who was frequently harassed and criticized, and I became an admirer of his because I thought he had a heart for the people.
When I went to Washington in the dark days of the depression as a young country kid from the poor hills of Texas, I had a standing rule with the page office that every time Senator Long took the floor, he would call me on the phone and I would go over there and perch in the Gallery and listen to every word he said.
And I heard them all.
I heard a lot about the history of this State.
I heard a lot of names in this State.
But I never heard him make a speech that I did not think was calculated to do some good for some people who needed some speeches made for them and could not make them for themselves.
The things that I am talking about from coast to coastI talked to six New England States last week and I am going to speak in six western States next weekthe things I am talking about from coast to coast tonight and tomorrow and next week are the things that he talked about 30 years ago.
He thought that every man had a right to a job, and that was long before the Full Employment Act.
He thought that every boy and girl ought to have a chance for all the education they could take, and that is before the GI bill of rights.
He thought that the old folks ought to have social security and old age pensions, and I remember when he just scared the dickens out of  Roosevelt and went on a nationwide radio hookup talking for old folks' pensions.
And out of this probably came our social security system.
He believed in medical care for those so that they could live in decency and dignity in their declining years, without their children having to come and move them into their house with them.
He was against poverty and hated it with all his soul and spoke until his voice was hoarse.
Well, like Jack Kennedy, he believed in those same things.
But their voices are still tonight, but they have left some to carry on.
And as long as the good Lord permits me, I am going to carry on.
Now, the people that would use us and destroy us first divide us.
There is not any combination in the country that can take on Russell Long, Allen Ellender, Lyndon Johnson, and a few others if we are together.
But if they divide us, they can make some hay.
And all these years they have kept their foot on our necks by appealing to our animosities, and dividing us.
Whatever your views are, we have a Constitution and we have a Bill of Rights, and we have the law of the land, and two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate voted for it and three-fourths of the Republicans.
I signed it, and I am going to enforce it, and I am going to observe it, and I think any man that is worthy of the high office of President is going to do the same thing.
But I am not going to let them build up the hate and try to buy my people by appealing to their prejudice.
I heard a great son of Texas who came from an adjoining State, whose name I will not call, but he was expelled from the university over there and he started West, and he got to Texas as a boy and stopped to see a schoolmate of his.
He liked things so well in Texas that he just decided to make it his permanent address.
In 4 years he went to the Congress.
After he had been in the House 2 years, he became the Democratic leader, and he served a few years as Democratic leader.
And he went to the Senate and he served in the Senate 4 years and he became the Democratic leader in the Senate.
He served the district that  Rayburn later served.
When  Rayburn came up as a young boy of the House, he went over to see the old Senator, the leader, one evening, who had come from this Southern State, and he was talking about economic problems.
He was talking about how we had been at the mercy of certain economic interests, and how they had exploited us.
They had worked our women for 5 cents an hour, they had worked our men for a dollar a day, they had exploited our soil, they had let our resources go to waste, they had taken everything out of the ground they could, and they had shipped it to other sections.
He was talking about the economy and what a great future we could have in the South, if we could just meet our economic problems, if we could just take a look at the resources of the South and develop them.
And he said, Sammy, I wish I felt a little better.
I would like to go back to old-and I will not call the name of the State; it was not Louisiana and it was not TexasI would like to go back down there and make them one more Democratic speech.
I just feel like I have one in me.
The poor old State, they have not heard a Democratic speech in 30 years.
All they ever hear at election time is Negro, Negro, Negro !So we have the law of the land, and we are going to appeal to all Americans that fight in uniform and work in factory and on the farm to try to conduct themselves as Americans.
Equal opportunity for all, special privileges for none, because there is only one real big problem that faces you.
It is not even the economic problem and it is not the Negro problem.
The only problem that faces you is whether you are going to live or die, and whether your family is going to live or die.
I sat through 37 meetings of the National Security Council during the Cuban crisis.
I never left home in the morning but what I realized I might not ever see her again that day.
She might not be there or I might not be there.
I sat at that table with the most trained generals and admirals we had, with four and five stars, and their war maps were out, and they took us from this stage to that stage, and we had our fleet moving, and we had our planes in the sky, and we had them loaded with our bombs.
And we knew they had their missiles pointing at us.
And the coolest man in that room, whose thumb was sitting there that could be put on the button, was the Commander in Chief, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who had been abused all over that country.
He is not here to defend himself, but I say shame on you that in his absence would attribute to him unworthy motives.
At Oak Ridge we have developed the mightiest, most awesome power that human ingenuity could contemplate or conceive.
By a thumb on a button you can wipe out 300 million lives in a matter of moments.
And this is no time and no hour and no day to be rattling your rockets around.
Or clicking your heels like a storm trooper.
I say that because this is a moment when all nations must look all ways to try to find some ways and means to learn to live together without destroying each other.
I have no reference to any nation, any country, or any individual.
I just say that when you look at history, and you see what has happened to us in our lifetime, we have gone through two wars, and then you see what the next war could bring us, it is no time to preach division or hate.
If there ever was a time for us to try to unite and find areas of agreement, it is now.
We are the mightiest nation in all the world, but that power must be used to prevent a war, instead of starting one.
I do not want to imply that there is any man in my party that wants to start one or anyone in any other party that wants to start one.
I think the Republicans are just as patriotic as the Democrats.
And I have not met any man that I know that I think wants to involve this country in any danger that he can avoid.
I just say it is time for all of us to put on our thinking caps.
It is time for all of us to follow the Golden Rule.
It is time for all of us to have a little trust and a little faith in each other, and to try to find some areas that we can agree on so we can have a united program.
I told you about the support that Vandenberg gave Truman in Greece and Turkey, about the support that I gave Eisenhower, Republican and Democrat, about the support that President Kennedy received in the Cuban missile crisis.
And this is an hour when we must not become so bitter or so divided or hate each other so much in an election period that we will let the other nations think we are divided.
The Kaiser thought we were divided and would not go to war and he sank the Lusitania and we became involved.
Hitler thought we were divided because a few Senators were preaching isolationism and talking about munitions makers and he thought that he could take a part of the world and we would sit there in our rocking chairs and do nothing about it.
And he got fooled.
Let no would-be conqueror ever mistake Uncle Sam.
We do not seek any wars.
But we are prepared and ready and willing to defend our freedom.
And we are not about to yield it or sacrifice it or whittle it away to anybody.
The election is coming up November the 3d.
You have your choice.
You have two parties.
You have two tickets.
You have men on both tickets who are experienced in the Congress, who served there many years.
You do not have to have anybody come down here and tell you what is right.
You do not have to have anybody come down here and tell you what you ought to do.
You know what is best for you, and you go do it.
And I am not even going to make a recommendation to you.
If you think in your own heart that the course of wisdom for your country is this course, then you follow whatever you think it is.
Because I believe that every other man is actuated by the same motives that I think I am actuated by.
He wants to do what is right.
I have never seen a man in Congress that I thought went there on a platform of doing what is wrong.
He wants to do what is right.
And I know the people of Louisiana want to do what is right.
And I hope if you do what you think is right, that somehow or other it is the same thing that I think is right.
But if it is not, I will not question your patriotism, I will not question your Americanism, I will not question your ancestry.
I may quietly in the sanctity of our bedroom whisper to Lady Bird my own personal opinion about your judgment.
My fellow Americans: On Thursday of last week, from the Kremlin in Moscow, the Soviet Government announced a change in its leadership.
On Friday of last week, Communist China exploded a nuclear device on an isolated test site in Sinkiang.
Both of these important events make it right that your President report to you as fully and as clearly and as promptly as he can.
That is what I mean to do this evening.
Now, let me begin with events in Moscow.
We do not know exactly what happened to Nikita Khrushchev last Thursday.
We do know that he has been forced out of power by his former friends and colleagues.
Five days ago he had only praise in Moscow.
Today we learn only of his faults.
Yet the men at the top today are the same men that he picked for leadership.
These men carried on the administration of the Soviet Government when he was absent from the Soviet capital, and that was nearly half of the time that he was in power.
Khrushchev was clearly the dominant figure in making Soviet policy.
After Lenin and Stalin, he is only the third man in history to have made himself the undisputed master of Communist Russia.
There were times when he was guilty of dangerous adventure.
It required great American firmness and good sensefirst in Berlin and later in the Cuban missile crisis-to turn back his threats and actions without war.
Yet he learned from his mistakes and he was not blind to realities.
In the last 2 years, his government had shown itself aware of the need for sanity in the nuclear age.
He joined in the nuclear test ban treaty.
He joined in the hot line which can help prevent a war by accident.
He agreed that space should be kept free of nuclear weapons.
In these actions he demonstrated good sense and sober judgment.
We do not think it was these actions that led to his removal.
We cannot know for sure just what did lead to this secret decision.
Our intelligence estimate is that Khrushchev learned of the decision only when for him it was too late.
There has been discontent and strain and failureboth within the Soviet Union and within the Communist bloc as a whole.
All of this has been evident for all to see.
These troubles are not the creation of one man.
They will not end with his removal.
When Lenin died in 1924, Stalin took four years to consolidate his power.
When Stalin died in 1953, it was not  Khrushchev who first emerged.
But two men now share top responsibility in the Soviet Union, and their exact relation to each other and to their colleagues is not yet very clear.
They are experienced, but younger men, and perhaps less rooted in the past.
They are said to be realistic.
We can hope that they will share with us our great objectivethe prevention of nuclear war.
But what does all this mean for us in America? It means at least four things: First, we must never forget that the men in the Kremlin remain dedicated, dangerous Communists.
A time of trouble among Communists requires steady vigilance among free menand most of all among Americans.
For it is the strength of the United States that holds the balance firm against danger.
Second, there will be turmoil in the Communist world.
It is likely that the men in the Kremlin will be concerned primarily with problems of communism.
This would not be all good, because there are problems and issues that need attention between our world and theirs.
But it is not all bad, because men who are busy with internal problems may not be tempted to reckless external acts.
Third, this great change will not stop the forces in Eastern Europe that are working for greater independence.
Those forces will continue to have our sympathy.
We will not give up our hope of building new bridges to these peoples.
Fourth, our own course must continue to prove that we on our side are ready to get on with the work of peace.
The new Soviet Government has officially informed me, through Ambassador Dobrynin, day before yesterday, that it plans no change in basic foreign policy.
I spoke frankly, as always, to the Soviet Ambassador.
I told him that the quest for peace in America had never been more determined than it is now.
I told him that we intend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried.
I reminded the Ambassador of the danger that we all faced 2 years ago in Cuba.
I told him that any Soviet Government which is ready to work for peace will find us ready in America.
I said to the Ambassador that I would be ready to talk to anyone, when it would help the cause of peace.
I believe that this was a good beginning, on both sides.
That same day the Chinese nuclear device was exploded at a test site near a lake called Lop Nor, in the Takla Makan desert of the remote Central Asian province of Sinkiang.
The building of this test site had been known to our American intelligence for several years.
In recent weeks the rapid pace of work there gave us a quite clear signal that the long and bitter efforts of this regime were leading at last to a nuclear test.
At first, in the 1950s, Russia helped the Chinese.
This assistance in the spread of nuclear weapons may now be regarded with some dismay in Moscow.
We believe that this help was ended in 1960 as the quarrel among the Communists grew sharper.
Soviet technicians left suddenly, with their blueprints under their arms.
And the unfinished facilities were just left there standing, and the expected supplies were cut off.
But the Red Chinese kept to their chosen purpose, even as their economic plans collapsed and the suffering of their people increased.
Our own distinguished Secretary of State,  Rusk, gave timely warning as the preparations at Lop Nor advanced.
And when the test occurred, I at once told the world that this explosion will not turn Americans and other free peoples from their steady purpose.
No American should treat this matter lightly.
Until this week, only four powers had entered the dangerous world of nuclear explosions.
Whatever their differences, all four are sober and serious states, with long experience as major powers in the modern world.
Communist China has no such experience.
Its nuclear pretensions are both expensive and cruel to its people.
It fools no one when it offers to trade away its first small accumulation of nuclear power against the mighty arsenals of those who limit Communist Chinese ambitions.
It shocks us by its readiness to pollute the atmosphere with fallout.
But this explosion remains a fact, sad and serious.
We must not, we have not, and we will not ignore it.
I discussed the limited meaning of this event in a statement on last Friday.
The world already knowsthat we were not surprised,that our defense plans take full account of this development,that we reaffirm our defense commitments in Asia,that it is a long, hard road from a first nuclear device to an effective weapons system, andthat our strength is overwhelming now and will be kept that way.
But what I have in my mind tonight is a different part of the meaning of this explosion at Lop Nor.
Communist China's expensive and demanding effort tempts other states to equal folly.
Nuclear spread is dangerous to all mankind.
What if there should come to be 10 nuclear powers, or maybe 20 nuclear powers?What if we must learn to look everywhere for the restraint which our own example now sets for a few?Will the human race be safe in such a day?The lesson of Lop Nor is that we are right to recognize the danger of nuclear spread; that we must continue to work against it, and we will.
First, we will continue to support the limited test ban treaty, which has made the air cleaner.
We call on the worldespecially Red Chinato join the nations which have signed that treaty.
Second, we will continue to work for an ending of all nuclear tests of every kind, by solid and verified agreement.
Third, we continue to believe that the struggle against nuclear spread is as much in the Soviet interest as in our own.
We will be ready to join with them and all the worldin working to avoid it.
Fourth, the nations that do not seek national nuclear weapons can be sure that if they need our strong support against some threat of nuclear blackmail, then they will have it.
The two events I have discussed are large and full of meaning, and I will discuss them at some length tomorrow with the legislative leaders of both parties.
They are coming here to the White House for a full and complete briefing tomorrow afternoon.
Yet they do not change our basic policy.
They just reinforce it.
Now let me take a minute to say that the same thing is true about another important event this week.
It is the victory of another party with another leader in Great Britain.
The British Labor Party is the same party that held power when the Atlantic Alliance was founded; when British and American pilots flew the Berlin Airlift together; when Englishmen joined us in Korea.
It is a party of freedom, of democracy, and of good faith.
Today it has the confidence of the British people.
It also has ours.
They are our friendsas the Conservatives before them are our friendsand as governments of both parties have been friends for generations.
We congratulate the winners.
We send warm regards to the losers.
The friendship of our two nations goes on.
This is our way with all our trusted allies.
This has been an eventful week in the affairs of the world.
It is not the first such week, nor will it be the last.
For the world has changed many times in the last 20 years.
Great leaders have come and gone.
Old enemies have become new friends.
Danger has taken the place of danger.
Through this period we have steadily moved toward a more hopeful world.
We have moved toward widening freedom and toward securing a more lasting peace.
We will continue in this direction.
What happens in other countries is important.
But the key to peace is to be found in the strength and the good sense of the United States of America.
Tonight we are the strongest nation in all the world, and the world knows it.
We love freedom and we will protect it and we will preserve it.
Tonight, as always, America's purpose is peace for all men.
Almost 11 months ago, at a still more fateful hour, just after I had assumed the Presidency, I spoke to all of the Congress and to our people of the purpose of America.
Let me close tonight by repeating what I said then:We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest.
This is the path that we shall continue to pursue.
Those who test our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable.
We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength; and the just can be strong in the defense of justice.
Thank youand good night to all of you.
My fellow Americans: On Thursday of last week, from the Kremlin in Moscow, the Soviet Government announced a change in its leadership.
On Friday of last week, Communist China exploded a nuclear device on an isolated test site in Sinkiang.
Both of these important events make it right that your President report to you as fully and as clearly and as promptly as he can.
That is what I mean to do this evening.
Now, let me begin with events in Moscow.
We do not know exactly what happened to Nikita Khrushchev last Thursday.
We do know that he has been forced out of power by his former friends and colleagues.
Five days ago he had only praise in Moscow.
Today we learn only of his faults.
Yet the men at the top today are the same men that he picked for leadership.
These men carried on the administration of the Soviet Government when he was absent from the Soviet capital, and that was nearly half of the time that he was in power.
Khrushchev was clearly the dominant figure in making Soviet policy.
After Lenin and Stalin, he is only the third man in history to have made himself the undisputed master of Communist Russia.
There were times when he was guilty of dangerous adventure.
It required great American firmness and good sensefirst in Berlin and later in the Cuban missile crisis-to turn back his threats and actions without war.
Yet he learned from his mistakes and he was not blind to realities.
In the last two years, his government had shown itself aware of the need for sanity in the nuclear age.
He joined in the nuclear test ban treaty.
He joined in the hot line which can help prevent a war by accident.
He agreed that space should be kept free of nuclear weapons.
In these actions he demonstrated good sense and sober judgment.
We do not think it was these actions that led to his removal.
We cannot know for sure just what did lead to this secret decision.
Our intelligence estimate is that Khrushchev learned of the decision only when for him it was too late.
There has been discontent and strain and failureboth within the Soviet Union and within the Communist bloc as a whole.
All of this has been evident for all to see.
These troubles are not the creation of one man.
They will not end with his removal.
When Lenin died in 1924, Stalin took four years to consolidate his power.
When Stalin died in 1953, it was not  Khrushchev who first emerged.
But two men now share top responsibility in the Soviet Union, and their exact relation to each other and to their colleagues is not yet very clear.
They are experienced, but younger men, and perhaps less rooted in the past.
They are said to be realistic.
We can hope that they will share with us our great objectivethe prevention of nuclear war.
But what does all this mean for us in America? It means at least four things: First, we must never forget that the men in the Kremlin remain dedicated, dangerous Communists.
A time of trouble among Communists requires steady vigilance among free menand most of all among Americans.
For it is the strength of the United States that holds the balance firm against danger.
Second, there will be turmoil in the Communist world.
It is likely that the men in the Kremlin will be concerned primarily with problems of communism.
This would not be all good, because there are problems and issues that need attention between our world and theirs.
But it is not all bad, because men who are busy with internal problems may not be tempted to reckless external acts.
Third, this great change will not stop the forces in Eastern Europe that are working for greater independence.
Those forces will continue to have our sympathy.
We will not give up our hope of building new bridges to these peoples.
Fourth, our own course must continue to prove that we on our side are ready to get on with the work of peace.
The new Soviet Government has officially informed me, through Ambassador Dobrynin, day before yesterday, that it plans no change in basic foreign policy.
I spoke frankly, as always, to the Soviet Ambassador.
I told him that the quest for peace in America had never been more determined than it is now.
I told him that we intend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried.
I reminded the Ambassador of the danger that we all faced two years ago in Cuba.
I told him that any Soviet Government which is ready to work for peace will find us ready in America.
I said to the Ambassador that I would be ready to talk to anyone, when it would help the cause of peace.
I believe that this was a good beginning, on both sides.
That same day the Chinese nuclear device was exploded at a test site near a lake called Lop Nor, in the Takla Makan desert of the remote Central Asian province of Sinkiang.
The building of this test site had been known to our American intelligence for several years.
In recent weeks the rapid pace of work there gave us a quite clear signal that the long and bitter efforts of this regime were leading at last to a nuclear test.
At first, in the 1950s, Russia helped the Chinese.
This assistance in the spread of nuclear weapons may now be regarded with some dismay in Moscow.
We believe that this help was ended in 1960 as the quarrel among the Communists grew sharper.
Soviet technicians left suddenly, with their blueprints under their arms.
And the unfinished facilities were just left there standing, and the expected supplies were cut off.
But the Red Chinese kept to their chosen purpose, even as their economic plans collapsed and the suffering of their people increased.
Our own distinguished Secretary of State,  Rusk, gave timely warning as the preparations at Lop Nor advanced.
And when the test occurred, I at once told the world that this explosion will not turn Americans and other free peoples from their steady purpose.
No American should treat this matter lightly.
Until this week, only four powers had entered the dangerous world of nuclear explosions.
Whatever their differences, all four are sober and serious states, with long experience as major powers in the modern world.
Communist China has no such experience.
Its nuclear pretensions are both expensive and cruel to its people.
It fools no one when it offers to trade away its first small accumulation of nuclear power against the mighty arsenals of those who limit Communist Chinese ambitions.
It shocks us by its readiness to pollute the atmosphere with fallout.
But this explosion remains a fact, sad and serious.
We must not, we have not, and we will not ignore it.
I discussed the limited meaning of this event in a statement on last Friday.
The world already knows:that we were not surprised,that our defense plans take full account of this development,that we reaffirm our defense commitments in Asia,that it is a long, hard road from a first nuclear device to an effective weapons system, andthat our strength is overwhelming now and will be kept that way.
But what I have in my mind tonight is a different part of the meaning of this explosion at Lop Nor.
Communist China's expensive and demanding effort tempts other states to equal folly.
Nuclear spread is dangerous to all mankind.
What if there should come to be 10 nuclear powers, or maybe 20 nuclear powers?What if we must learn to look everywhere for the restraint which our own example now sets for a few?Will the human race be safe in such a day?The lesson of Lop Nor is that we are right to recognize the danger of nuclear spread; that we must continue to work against it, and we will.
First, we will continue to support the limited test ban treaty, which has made the air cleaner.
We call on the worldespecially Red Chinato join the nations which have signed that treaty.
Second, we will continue to work for an ending of all nuclear tests of every kind, by solid and verified agreement.
Third, we continue to believe that the struggle against nuclear spread is as much in the Soviet interest as in our own.
We will be ready to join with them and all the worldin working to avoid it.
Fourth, the nations that do not seek national nuclear weapons can be sure that if they need our strong support against some threat of nuclear blackmail, then they will have it.
The two events I have discussed are large and full of meaning, and I will discuss them at some length tomorrow with the legislative leaders of both parties.
They are coming here to the White House for a full and complete briefing tomorrow afternoon.
Yet they do not change our basic policy.
They just reinforce it.
Now let me take a minute to say that the same thing is true about another important event this week.
It is the victory of another party with another leader in Great Britain.
The British Labor Party is the same party that held power when the Atlantic Alliance was founded; when British and American pilots flew the Berlin Airlift together; when Englishmen joined us in Korea.
It is a party of freedom, of democracy, and of good faith.
Today it has the confidence of the British people.
It also has ours.
They are our friendsas the Conservatives before them are our friendsand as governments of both parties have been friends for generations.
We congratulate the winners.
We send warm regards to the losers.
The friendship of our two nations goes on.
This is our way with all our trusted allies.
This has been an eventful week in the affairs of the world.
It is not the first such week, nor will it be the last.
For the world has changed many times in the last 20 years.
Great leaders have come and gone.
Old enemies have become new friends.
Danger has taken the place of danger.
Through this period we have steadily moved toward a more hopeful world.
We have moved toward widening freedom and toward securing a more lasting peace.
We will continue in this direction.
What happens in other countries is important.
But the key to peace is to be found in the strength and the good sense of the United States of America.
Tonight we are the strongest nation in all the world, and the world knows it.
We love freedom and we will protect it and we will preserve it.
Tonight, as always, America's purpose is peace for all men.
Almost 11 months ago, at a still more fateful hour, just after I had assumed the Presidency, I spoke to all of the Congress and to our people of the purpose of America.
Let me close tonight by repeating what I said then:We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest.
This is the path that we shall continue to pursue.
Those who test our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable.
We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength; and the just can be strong in the defense of justice.
Thank youand good night to all of you.
Speaker,  President, members of the Congress, my fellow Americans:On this Hill which was my home, I am stirred by old friendships.
Though total agreement between the executive and the Congress is impossible, total respect is important.
I am proud to be among my colleagues of the Congress whose legacy to their trust is their loyalty to their nation.
I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new members of this body tonight.
Twenty-eight years ago, I felt as you do now.
You will soon learn that you are among men whose first love is their country, men who try each day to do as best they can what they believe is right.
We are entering the third century of the pursuit of American union.
Two hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined together to demand freedom from arbitrary power.
For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man.
One hundred years ago, in 1865, following a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact of union was finally sealed.
For a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many groups which make up the American community.
That struggle has often brought pain and violence.
It is not yet over.
But we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in the history of freedom.
And so tonight, now, in 1965, we begin a new quest for union.
We seek the unity of man with the world that he has built  with the knowledge that can save or destroy him  with the cities which can stimulate or stifle him  with the wealth and the machines which can enrich or menace his spirit.
We seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow each of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate the quality of our civilization.
This is the search that we begin tonight.
But the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in isolation.
For today the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon the state of the world.
Our concern and interest, compassion and vigilance, extend to every corner of a dwindling planet.
Yet, it is not merely our concern but the concern of all free men.
We will not, and we should not, assume that it is the task of Americans alone to settle all the conflicts of a torn and troubled world.
Let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this.
For in concert with other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom.
Our first aim remains the safety and the well-being of our own country.
We are prepared to live as good neighbors with all, but we cannot be indifferent to acts designed to injure our interests, or our citizens, or our establishments abroad.
The community of nations requires mutual respect.
We shall extend it  and we shall expect it.
In our relations with the world we shall follow the example of Andrew Jackson who said: I intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong.
And he promised, that the honor of my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the statement of truth or for the performance of duty.
That was this nation's policy in the 1830s and that is this nation's policy in the 1960s.
Our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the American dream.
We were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide desert of disappointed dreams.
Our nation was created to help strike away the chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they keep man less than God means him to be.
We are moving toward that destiny, never more rapidly than we have moved in the last four years.
In this period we have built a military power strong enough to meet any threat and destroy any adversary.
And that superiority will continue to grow so long as this office is mine  and you sit on Capitol Hill.
In this period no new nation has become Communist, and the unity of the Communist empire has begun to crumble.
In this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our neighbors of the hemisphere, and joined in an Alliance for Progress toward economic growth and political democracy.
In this period we have taken more steps toward peace  including the test ban treaty  than at any time since the Cold War began.
In this period we have relentlessly pursued our advances toward the conquest of space.
Most important of all, in this period, the United States has reemerged into the fullness of its self-confidence and purpose.
No longer are we called upon to get America moving.
We are moving.
No longer do we doubt our strength or resolution.
We are strong and we have proven our resolve.
No longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay.
We know that history is ours to make.
And if there is great danger, there is now also the excitement of great expectations.
Yet we still live in a troubled and perilous world.
There is no longer a single threat.
There are many.
They differ in intensity and in danger.
They require different attitudes and different answers.
With the Soviet Union we seek peaceful understandings that can lessen the danger to freedom.
Last fall I asked the American people to choose that course.
I will carry forward their command.
If we are to live together in peace, we must come to know each other better.
I am sure that the American people would welcome a chance to listen to the Soviet leaders on our television  as I would like the Soviet people to hear our leaders on theirs.
I hope the new Soviet leaders can visit America so they can learn about our country at firsthand.
In Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their identity.
Your government, assisted by the leaders in American labor and business, is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these countries and with the Soviet Union.
I will report our conclusions to the Congress.
In Asia, communism wears a more aggressive face.
We see that in Vietnam.
Why are we there?We are there, first, because a friendly nation has asked us for help against the Communist aggression.
Ten years ago our President pledged our help.
Three Presidents have supported that pledge.
We will not break it now.
Second, our own security is tied to the peace of Asia.
Twice in one generation we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East.
To ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war.
Our goal is peace in Southeast Asia.
That will come only when aggressors leave their neighbors in peace.
What is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will never be found wanting.
But Communism is not the only source of trouble and unrest.
There are older and deeper sources  in the misery of nations and in man's irrepressible ambition for liberty and a better life.
With the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt  and my country has always felt  very special ties of interest and affection.
It will be the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties.
Together we share and shape the destiny of the new world.
In the coming year I hope to pay a visit to Latin America.
And I will steadily enlarge our commitment to the Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and injustice in this hemisphere.
In the Atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 years  a Europe that is growing in strength, unity, and cooperation with America.
A great unfinished task is the reunification of Germany through self-determination.
This European policy is not based on any abstract design.
It is based on the realities of common interests and common values, common dangers and common expectations.
These realities will continue to have their way  especially, I think, in our expanding trade and especially in our common defense.
Free Americans have shaped the policies of the United States.
And because we know these realities, those policies have been, and will be, in the interest of Europe.
Free Europeans must shape the course of Europe.
And, for the same reasons, that course has been, and will be, in our interest and in the interest of freedom.
I found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the last year.
I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe this year.
In Africa and Asia we are witnessing the turbulent unfolding of new nations and continents.
We welcome them to the society of nations.
We are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own independence, and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to the welfare of all of their people.
We seek not fidelity to an iron faith, but a diversity of belief as varied as man himself.
We seek not to extend the power of America but the progress of humanity.
We seek not to dominate others but to strengthen the freedom of all people.
I will seek new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the growing scarcity in world resources.
Finally, we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the effectiveness of the United Nations.
The frustrations of the United Nations are a product of the world that we live in, and not of the institution which gives them voice.
It is far better to throw these differences open to the assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger.
These are some of the goals of the American nation in the world in which we live.
For ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame, neither gratitude nor obedience.
We seek peace.
We seek freedom.
We seek to enrich the life of man.
For that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that we mean for all men to ultimately have.
World affairs will continue to call upon our energy and our courage.
But today we can turn increased attention to the character of American life.
We are in the midst of the greatest upward surge of economic well-being in the history of any nation.
Our flourishing progress has been marked by price stability that is unequalled in the world.
Our balance of payments deficit has declined and the soundness of our dollar is unquestioned.
I pledge to keep it that way and I urge business and labor to cooperate to that end.
We worked for two centuries to climb this peak of prosperity.
But we are only at the beginning of the road to the Great Society.
Ahead now is a summit where freedom from the wants of the body can help fulfill the needs of the spirit.
We built this nation to serve its people.
We want to grow and build and create, but we want progress to be the servant and not the master of man.
We do not intend to live in the midst of abundance, isolated from neighbors and nature, confined by blighted cities and bleak suburbs, stunted by a poverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure.
The Great Society asks not how much, but how good; not only how to create wealth but how to use it; not only how fast we are going, but where we are headed.
It proposes as the first test for a nation: the quality of its people.
This kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swelling riches and surging power.
It will not be the gift of government or the creation of Presidents.
It will require of every American, for many generations, both faith in the destination and the fortitude to make the journey.
And like freedom itself, it will always be challenge and not fulfillment.
And tonight we accept that challenge.
I propose that we begin a program in education to ensure every American child the fullest development of his mind and skills.
I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing diseases.
I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a better and a more stimulating place to live.
I propose that we increase the beauty of America and end the poisoning of our rivers and the air that we breathe.
I propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country that are now suffering from distress and depression.
I propose that we make new efforts to control and prevent crime and delinquency.
I propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and the opportunity to vote.
I propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the creations of art.
I propose that we make an all-out campaign against waste and inefficiency.
Our basic task is threefold:First, to keep our economy growing;  to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most Americans;  and to improve the quality of life for all.
In the next six weeks I will submit special messages with detailed proposals for national action in each of these areas.
Tonight I would like just briefly to explain some of my major recommendations in the three main areas of national need.
First, we must keep our nation prosperous.
We seek full employment opportunity for every American citizen.
I will present a budget designed to move the economy forward.
More money will be left in the hands of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes.
We will continue along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy.
I confidently predict  what every economic sign tells us tonight  the continued flourishing of the American economy.
But we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact of a recession.
The knowledge that our government will, and can, move swiftly will strengthen the confidence of investors and business.
Congress can reinforce this confidence by insuring that its procedures permit rapid action on temporary income tax cuts.
And special funds for job-creating public programs should be made available for immediate use if recession threatens.
Our continued prosperity demands continued price stability.
Business, labor, and the consumer all have a high stake in keeping wages and prices within the framework of the guideposts that have already served the nation so well.
Finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of American business.
But we stand ready  with credit and other help  to assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire nation.
Our economy owes much to the efficiency of our farmers.
We must continue to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward.
I have instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to lead a major effort to find new approaches to reduce the heavy cost of our farm programs and to direct more of our effort to the small farmer who needs the help the most.
We can help insure continued prosperity through:  a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken areas left behind by our national progress;  further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern technology, for the laboring-man is an indispensable force in the American system;  the extension of the minimum wage to more than two million unprotected workers;  the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation system.
And as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms, I will propose to Congress changes in the Taft-Hartley Act including section 14(b).
I will do so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided Americans in various States of our Union.
In a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to continued growth.
I will recommend heavier reliance on competition in transportation and a new policy for our merchant marine.
I will ask for funds to study high-speed rail transportation between urban centers.
We will begin with test projects between Washington and Boston.
On high-speed trains, passengers could travel this distance in less than four hours.
Second, we must open opportunity to all our people.
Most Americans enjoy a good life.
But far too many are still trapped in poverty and idleness and fear.
Let a just nation throw open to them the city of promise:  to the elderly, by providing hospital care under social security and by raising benefit payments to those struggling to maintain the dignity of their later years;  to the poor and the unfortunate, through doubling the war against poverty this year;  to Negro Americans, through enforcement of the civil rights law and elimination of barriers to the right to vote;  to those in other lands that are seeking the promise of America, through an immigration law based on the work a man can do and not where he was born or how he spells his name.
Our third goal is to improve the quality of American life.
We begin with learning.
Every child must have the best education that this nation can provide.
Thomas Jefferson said that no nation can be both ignorant and free.
Today no nation can be both ignorant and great.
In addition to our existing programs, I will recommend a new program for schools and students with a first-year authorization of $1,500 million.
It will help at every stage along the road to learning.
For the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the excitement of learning.
For the primary and secondary school years we will aid public schools serving low-income families and assist students in both public and private schools.
For the college years we will provide scholarships to high school students of the greatest promise and the greatest need and we will guarantee low-interest loans to students continuing their college studies.
New laboratories and centers will help our schools  help them lift their standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching.
These centers will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve special treatment.
Greatness requires not only an educated people but a healthy people.
Our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of our people.
We already carry on a large program in this country, for research and health.
In addition, regional medical centers can provide the most advanced diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other major diseases.
New support for medical and dental education will provide the trained people to apply our knowledge.
Community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for school-age children from poor families, including services for the mentally retarded.
An educated and healthy people require surroundings in harmony with their hopes.
In our urban areas the central problem today is to protect and restore man's satisfaction in belonging to a community where he can find security and significance.
The first step is to break old patterns  to begin to think and work and plan for the development of the entire metropolitan areas.
We will take this step with new programs of help for the basic community facilities and for neighborhood centers of health and recreation.
New and existing programs will be open to those cities which work together to develop unified long-range policies for metropolitan areas.
We must also make some very important changes in our housing programs if we are to pursue these same basic goals.
So a Department of Housing and Urban Development will be needed to spearhead this effort in our cities.
Every citizen has the right to feel secure in his home and on the streets of his community.
To help control crime, we will recommend programs:  to train local law enforcement officers;  to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal;  to discover the causes of crime and better ways to prevent it.
I will soon assemble a panel of outstanding experts of this nation to search out answers to the national problem of crime and delinquency, and I welcome the recommendations and the constructive efforts of the Congress.
For over three centuries the beauty of America has sustained our spirit and has enlarged our vision.
We must act now to protect this heritage.
In a fruitful new partnership with the states and the cities the next decade should be a conservation milestone.
We must make a massive effort to save the countryside and to establish  as a green legacy for tomorrow  more large and small parks, more seashores and open spaces than have been created during any other period in our national history.
A new and substantial effort must be made to landscape highways to provide places of relaxation and recreation wherever our roads run,Within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation.
We will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water before it happens.
We will step up our effort to control harmful wastes, giving first priority to the cleanup of our most contaminated rivers.
We will increase research to learn much more about the control of pollution.
We hope to make the Potomac a model of beauty here in the capital, and preserve unspoiled stretches of some of our waterways with a Wild Rivers bill.
More ideas for a beautiful America will emerge from a White House Conference on Natural Beauty which I will soon call.
We must also recognize and encourage those who can be pathfinders for the nation's imagination and understanding.
To help promote and honor creative achievements, I will propose a National Foundation on the Arts.
To develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress, I will recommend programs to encourage basic science, particularly in the universities  and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our growing need for fresh water.
For government to serve these goals it must be modern in structure, efficient in action, and ready for any emergency.
I am busy, currently, reviewing the structure of the entire executive branch of this government.
I hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to meet more effectively the tasks of the 20th century.
Wherever waste is found, I will eliminate it.
Last year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the national government.
And I intend to do better this year.
And very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies that your government plans to make.
Even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards.
I will propose laws to insure the necessary continuity of leadership should the President become disabled or die.
In addition, I will propose reforms in the Electoral College  leaving undisturbed the vote by states  but making sure that no elector can substitute his will for that of the people.
Last year, in a sad moment, I came here and I spoke to you after 33 years of public service, practically all of them here on this Hill.
This year I speak after one year as President of the United States.
Many of you in this chamber are among my oldest friends.
We have shared many happy moments and many hours of work, and we have watched many Presidents together.
Yet, only in the White House can you finally know the full weight of this Office.
The greatest burden is not running the huge operations of government  or meeting daily troubles, large and small  or even working with the Congress.
A President's hardest task is not to do what is right, but to know what is right.
Yet the Presidency brings no special gift of prophecy or foresight.
You take an oath, you step into an office, and you must then help guide a great democracy.
The answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born.
It was once barren land.
The angular hills were covered with scrub cedar and a few large live oaks.
Little would grow in that harsh caliche soil of my country.
And each spring the Pedernales River would flood our valley.
But men came and they worked and they endured and they built.
And tonight that country is abundant; abundant with fruit and cattle and goats and sheep, and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are gone.
Why did men come to that once forbidding land?Well, they were restless, of course, and they had to be moving on.
But there was more than that.
There was a dream  a dream of a place where a free man could build for himself, and raise his children to a better life  a dream of a continent to be conquered, a world to be won, a nation to be made.
Remembering this, I knew the answer.
A President does not shape a new and personal vision of America.
He collects it from the scattered hopes of the American past.
It existed when the first settlers saw the coast of a new world, and when the first pioneers moved westward.
It has guided us every step of the way.
It sustains every President.
But it is also your inheritance and it belongs equally to all the people that we all serve.
It must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs; as I have tried, in part, to do tonight.
It shall lead us as we enter the third century of the search for a more perfect union?This, then, is the state of the Union: Free and restless, growing and full of hope.
So it was in the beginning.
So it shall always be, while God is willing, and we are strong enough to keep the faith.
My fellow countrymen:On this occasion the oath I have taken before you and before God is not mine alone, but ours together.
We are one nation and one people.
Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all citizens.
That is the majesty and the meaning of this moment.
For every generation there is a destiny.
For some, history decides.
For this generation the choice must be our own.
Even now, a rocket moves toward Mars.
It reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children, or even for ourselves in a short span of years.
The next man to stand here will look out on a scene that is different from our own.
Ours is a time of change  rapid and fantastic change  bearing the secrets of nature, multiplying the nations, placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction, shaking old values and uprooting old ways.
Our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith.
They came here  the exile and the stranger, brave but frightened  to find a place where a man could be his own man.
They made a covenant with this land.
Conceived in justice, written in liberty, bound in union, it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind.
And it binds us still.
If we keep its terms we shall flourish.
First, justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land.
In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty.
In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry.
In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended.
In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write.
For more than 30 years that I have served this Nation I have believed that this injustice to our people, this waste of our resources, was our real enemy.
For 30 years or more, with the resources I have had, I have vigilantly fought against it.
I have learned and I know that it will not surrender easily.
But change has given us new weapons.
Before this generation of Americans is finished, this enemy will not only retreat, it will be conquered.
Justice requires us to remember: when any citizen denies his fellow, saying: His color is not mine or his beliefs are strange and different, in that moment he betrays America, though his forebears created this Nation.
Liberty was the second article of our covenant.
It was self-government.
It was our Bill of Rights.
But it was more.
America would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself: stretching his talents, rejoicing in his work, important in the life of his neighbors and his nation.
This has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men.
We must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen.
The American covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man.
And that is today our goal.
Thus, if as a nation, there is much outside our control, as a people no stranger is outside our hope.
Change has brought new meaning to that old mission.
We can never again stand aside, prideful in isolation.
Terrific dangers and troubles that we once called foreign now constantly live among us.
If American lives must end, and American treasure be spilled, in countries that we barely know, then that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant.
Think of our world as it looks from that rocket that is heading toward Mars.
It is like a child's globe, hanging in space, the continent stuck to its side like colored maps.
We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth.
And each of us, in the span of time, has really only a moment among our companions.
How incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another.
There are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature.
There is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way.
Our Nation's course is abundantly clear.
We aspire to nothing that belongs to others.
We seek no dominion over our fellow man, but man's dominion over tyranny and misery.
But more is required.
Men want to be part of a common enterprise, a cause greater than themselves.
And each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the Nation, thus finding new purpose for ourselves.
Without this, we will simply become a nation of strangers.
The third article is union.
To those who were small and few against the wilderness, the success of liberty demanded the strength of union.
Two centuries of change have made this true again.
No longer need capitalist and worker, farmer and clerk, city and countryside, struggle to divide our bounty.
By working shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all.
We have discovered that every child who learns, and every man who finds work, and every sick body that is made whole  like a candle added to an altar  brightens the hope of all the faithful.
So let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and rekindle old hatreds.
They stand in the way of a seeking nation.
Let us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose.
For the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife, to achieve change without hatred; not without difference of opinion but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations.
Under this covenant of justice, liberty, and union we have become a nation  prosperous, great, and mighty.
And we have kept our freedom.
But we have no promise from God that our greatness will endure.
We have been allowed by Him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit.
I do not believe that the Great Society is the ordered, changeless, and sterile battalion of the ants.
It is the excitement of becoming  always becoming, trying, probing, falling, resting, and trying again  but always trying and always gaining.
In each generation, with toil and tears, we have had to earn our heritage again.
If we fail now then we will have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship: that democracy rests on faith, that freedom asks more than it gives, and the judgment of God is harshest on those who are most favored.
If we succeed it will not be because of what we have, but it will be because of what we are; not because of what we own, but rather because of what we believe.
For we are a nation of believers.
Underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day's pursuits, we are believers in justice and liberty and in our own union.
We believe that every man must some day be free.
And we believe in ourselves.
And that is the mistake that our enemies have always made.
In my lifetime, in depression and in war they have awaited our defeat.
Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith that they could not see or that they could not even imagine.
And it brought us victory.
And it will again.
For this is what America is all about.
It is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge.
It is the star that is not reached and the harvest that is sleeping in the unplowed ground.
Is our world gone? We say farewell.
Is a new world coming? We welcome it, and we will bend it to the hopes of man.
And to these trusted public servants and to my family, and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long winding road, and to all the people of this Union and the world, I will repeat today what I said on that sorrowful day in November last year: I will lead and I will do the best I can.
But you, you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams.
They will lead you best of all.
For myself, I ask only in the words of an ancient leader: Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?.
Today I am sending to the Congress my agricultural message.
It is a message for all farmers and ranchers, both large and small.
It is a message for all of rural America.
In the Texas of my boyhood, farming was the backbone of our economy.
This message that I am sending to Congress today makes it very clear that the farmer and the agricultural community are still most important in the American way of life.
But this message is not only for our Nation's farmers and those who live in our rural areas.
This is a message for all Americans who benefit from our unparalleled harvest of plenty.
Food today is our best bargain.
It is right and it is proper that a grateful Nation should properly reward those who make possible the food that sustains us all.
In this message today, I make the following recommendations: First, the appointment of a blue ribbon commission of Americans to assist in adapting our farm programs to the needs of tomorrow and the 20th century.
I will ask this commission to conduct a fundamental examination of the entire agricultural policy of the United States of America.
Second, I am taking steps to assure that benefits of Federal programs are distributed fairly between the urban and the rural areas.
Third, I am proposing new loans for rural areas for better housing at lower budget costs.
Fourth, I am recommending that we continue price and income support programs which are necessary to prevent a catastrophic decline in our farm income.
Fifth, we will begin a long-term land use program which will help achieve the best use of our land at the least possible cost.
Sixth, we will take increased steps to find new markets abroad for our farm products.
Secretary Freeman has just this week returned from Europe where he has been in that interest.
Agriculture is one of our best dollar producers in the foreign market.
It is the number one export in the American economy.
This message that I have sent to Congress recognizes the great importance of an agricultural economy.
Depressions and recessions are usually farm led and farm fed.
During the weeks and months ahead, details of our programs for agricultural and rural America will be presented.
It is my earnest hope that these programs will permit us to travel farther down the road toward our goal of parity income for American agriculture and parity of opportunity for rural America.
Last week, the House of Representatives adopted a proposal that would, if brought into law, by adding an amendment on the appropriation bill, prevent the United States of America from carrying out a 30-year agreement that we had made with the United Arab Republic.
This agreement was to sell surplus commodities to the United Arab Republic under what is called tide I of Public Law 480.
Yesterday the Senate passed a milder version of this proposal and moderated the House amendment.
It would permit delivery of surplus commodities if the President determined it to be in the national interest.
I judge it of the highest importance that the flexibility provided the President by the Senate version be sustained by the Congress.
I hope the House of Representatives will accept the improvements made by the Senate committee and voted by the Senate.
Because if we are to protect our vital interests in this part of the world where tensions are very high, then the President must have freedom of action to act in the best interest of all the people of this land.
It is of course obvious that the relations between the United States and the United Arab Republic must be improved.
It will demand effort from both countries.
I cannot predict whether improvement can be achieved.
But if we are to have any degree of success in this sensitive relationship the President must have some freedom of action.
I earnestly suggest to the Congress that they consider this need which I believe is truly in the best interest of all of our people and is not in any manner a partisan matter, as demonstrated by the very fine speech made by the Minority Leader, Senator Dirksen, yesterday.
On another matter, I should like to say that all Americans should be indignant when one American is denied the right to vote.
The loss of that right to a single citizen undermines the freedom of every citizen.
This is why all of us should be concerned with the efforts of our fellow Americans to register to vote in Alabama.
The basic problem in Selma is the slow pace of voting registration for Negroes who are qualified to vote.
We are using the tools of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an effort to secure their right to vote.
One of those tools of course is legal action to guarantee a citizen his right.
One case of voting discrimination has already led to a trial which has just been concluded.
We are now awaiting a decision in this case.
In the meantime I hope that all Americans will join with me in expressing their concern over the loss of any American's right to vote.
Nothing is more fundamental to American citizenship and to our freedom as a nation and as a people.
I intend to see that that right is secured for all of our citizens.
I had planned to make these statements for the newsreels and recording, and I informed  Reedy while I was here I would be glad to take any questions that might flow from them or any other questions on any subject that might interest you.
No.
I think the statements I made last night were made in the light of the information we have at the moment and the judgments that we have exercised.
I said that I had reason to believe-that the reason to believe was based upon discussions that have taken place between the representatives of the Government of the United States and the Soviet Union.
The details of the exchanges will be made public as soon as they are definite.
I have only seen the very brief press report regarding General de Gaulle's conference, which apparently has just concluded before this meeting, and I would much prefer to await a full report on the exact statement before getting into any detailed discussion involving the General's observations.
It is the position of this country, however, we believe, that the problems of the United Nations are traceable not to the United Nations Charter but to those countries which have violated either the spirit or the letter of the charter, because we believe that the framework for world progress and peace is in the charter.
And I will be glad to respectfully review any observations the General has made and give due consideration to them.
President, there has been some criticism both abroad and here because Vice President Humphrey was not sent to London to the Churchill funeral.
Would you care to go into your reasons and what motivated you in selecting the American delegation? Well, at first I thought I would hope that I would be able to go if my physical condition permitted.
I asked that we defer final decisions until the doctors could act.
But I had my staff contact President Truman and President Eisenhower and express the hope they could accompany me.
President Truman was unable to go and President Eisenhower informed us that he had accepted the invitation of the family and he would be going and that he would be in attendance and would be doing other things there.
I urged that he go with us in our delegation and sent a plane to California to pick him up.
At the same time I personally called the Chief Justice and asked if he would agree to go with me in case we made the trip.
I also was informed we had Senator Fulbright, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Hickenlooper, the ranking Republican of that committee, and eight other Senators in London at the time, some of whom would be paying their respects as representatives of this country.
I felt that with the former President, with the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, with the distinguished Ambassador of this country to the United Kingdom, that we had a good delegation and a high ranking delegation.
I had no particular reason for not asking the Vice President to go, although the Vice President, as you may or may not have observed, was addressing the delegates from 50 States at noon the day the plane left at 7:30 in the morning, on his new responsibilities in the field of civil rights.
I am glad to have the press reactions and the reactions abroad on the protocol involved in connection with funerals.
I had served as Vice President for 3 years and it had never occurred to me and I had never had it brought to my attention so vividly that it was the duty and the function of the Vice President to be present at all official funerals.
On occasions during the 3 years I was Vice President I attended one or two funerals representing this country, but there were many representatives from many walks of life.
I did review the list of delegates representing their countries at the Churchill funeral and I did not observe that other nations sent in most instances either their top man or the next man necessarily.
I thought we had a rather well-rounded delegation in the former President, the Secretary of State, the Senators who were present, the Chief Justice of our Supreme Court.
In the light of your interest and other interests, I may have made a mistake by asking the Chief Justice to go and not asking the Vice President.
I will bear in mind in connection with any future funerals your very strong feelings in the matter and try to act in accordance with our national interest.
Yes.
There has been no change in the position of this country in regard to our desire or our determination to help the people of Viet-Nam preserve their freedom.
I frequently observe to the people of this country that our basic commitment to Viet-Nam was made in a statement 10 years ago by our President, to the general effect that we would help the people of Viet-Nam help themselves.
Now we have difficulties from day to day and sometimes they increase with the hours, and we have  Bundy out in Viet-Nam now on a regular exchange of views with our spokesmen and our representatives in that area.
Normally, about every 6 weeks or 2 months we ask our Ambassador and our military advisers to bring us a full exchange of views.
General Taylor was here, I believe, in July and again in September and maybe in December, and he was due to come back here in February.
In the light of the recent developments out there, he thought that it would be better if  Bundy came out there at this particular time than for him to take the time out for a trip back to the United States.
So in accordance with his suggestion I recommended that  Bundy go there and that General Taylor bring him up to date on the military situation in that country, on the political situation in that country, and give us his views as to what our course should be in trying to continue to be more effective and efficient in aiding the people of Viet-Nam to preserve their freedom.
Bundy will be back on the weekend.
He no doubt will bring with him all the information that is available to our people, and I will be glad to make as much of that information available as is in the national interest.
I only want to reassert this morning our determination to continue our present policy, the policy of our Government from the beginning, to try to help the people of Viet-Nam help themselves to preserve their freedom.
The Kosygin visit and its implications and its significance could best be interpreted by  Kosygin.
Our visit to South Viet-Nam is required by our regular practice of exchanging views every 6 weeks or 2 months.
It has nothing whatever to do with the Kosygin visit.
It was planned before we had information of the Kosygin visit.
What the purposes of  Kosygin and what the results of his visit to Peiping or Hanoi will be are unknown to me at this time.
We will have to await developments to see what flows from those meetings.
I would not anticipate that we would receive such an invitation.
I would comment only on the dispatch that came from unknown and unauthorized, and I rather think, uninformed sources in Paris.
In my judgment that dispatch had no validity and like a good many, was completely untrue.
I believe that we will continue, as I said before, to do our very best to make our effort in Viet-Nam more efficient and more effective in helping the people of Viet-Nam to help themselves.
I would not want to speculate on what might be it- this situation happened or that situation happened.
I would want to cross that bridge when I came to it.
But I do not anticipate crossing any such bridge as was indicated by the dispatch from Paris.
It means that my position, I think, is abundantly clear: that we are there to be as effective and efficient as we can in helping the people of South Viet-Nam resist aggression and preserve their freedom.
You will find from time to time that Senators from both the Democratic and the Republican Parties will have different viewpoints, to which they are entitled, and they will express them, as I have expressed mine.
Yes.
I gave a good deal of consideration to the action of the Veterans Administration in closing the installations that they recommended be closed in the interest of savings and economy and the interest of the veterans themselves.
This recommendation was first made by  Gleason who had served many years as Administrator of Veterans Affairs.
Gleason's recommendations were sent to the appropriate people in the Budget Bureau and they studied them and agreed with  Gleason and referred them to the President with their views.
Upon the receipt of those recommendations I carefully studied them and sent them to the new Veterans Administrator,  Driver, for his study and consideration and any action that he cared to take.
Driver made a very careful study of each of the installations and made rather full recommendations back through the appropriate officials in the Budget Bureau.
They forwarded  Driver's recommendations back to the White House and I asked an independent attorney, one of very judicious temperament and a good many years experience in handling public property and land and installations, to make an independent study of each of the installations and each of the consolidations.
He prepared for me a memorandum, in which he concurred in  Gleason's recommendations, in  Driver's recommendations, in the Director of the Budget's recommendations, and he said that the public interest required that the Veterans Administrator take the action that he proposed to take.
I have heard from most of the representatives of the communities involved.
I have heard from a good many of the people who live in those communities.
We recognize the economic impact of the closing of these installations and the hardship that it brings in some instances.
We are doing what we can to minimize that hardship.
We do not feel that we are justified in taking the taxpayers' money to support a hospital that in many instances the people feel should not have been so located to begin with, in some instances is not modern, in other instances the head of the medical facilities of the Veterans Administration urged that they never he established to begin with because they could not attract outstanding military and professional medical people.
And it is our judgment that we are not justified in paying $5 or $6 a day more to keep veterans, service-connected or non-service-connected, in one of these smaller hospitals when he could get the best modern medicine available at a much cheaper cost in a hospital in the area.
Now Congress may have a different viewpoint.
I have observed that they have asked us to permit the Independent Offices Committee of the Senate Appropriations Committee to look further into it.
The chairman of the House Veterans Committee was consulted before we took this action, and he proposes to make a close study of it now in the House as they have done in the Senate.
We will, of course, supply all the information we have and we will receive all the information that anyone else has to offer, and we will always be glad to give it consideration.
But the judgments we have made, insofar as we can now determine, were made on the best facts available, and we do not believe that the national interests of all of our people justify the waste that will occur if we satisfy the narrow local requirements.
As desirable as they may be to the local community, they do not necessarily serve the national interest.
They take my blood pressure practically every morning.
They look at my throat.
The comments now are they think I am doing very well, and most of the symptoms of the infection I had are gone.
Although I do not feel as bouncy as I did before I went to the hospital, I am putting in a rather full day these days.
I had a bowl of soup in my office for lunch yesterday and worked until I went to the meeting last night and had my dinner after I returned.
I am reasonably well caught up with my work and I feel in good shape.
I would be glad to have you, if you have any specific requests that you want to pursue, talk to  Burkley about it.
He would be glad to give it to you.
He sees me every day.
No, I never indicated I wanted to wait for the Senate.
I said that was a matter for the Senate, and that is what I would repeat.
No, I would not care to make a comment about a matter that is under investigation in a Senate committee and is being thoroughly studied by a local grand jury.
I have stated at various times that the question has been raised that I think that this is a matter for the Senate to study and if there has been any violation of the law, for the grand jury and the FBI and the Department of Justice to take appropriate action.
Now I have referred to the FBI any and all information of a substantive nature that has come to my attention in this regard.
That information is being presented to the grand jury and is being or has been or will be presented to the committee, and I think the committee will draw its own conclusions and I have no doubt but what the grand jury will act appropriately in the matter.
No, I did not intend to preludeI did not intend to narrow our interests in the matter.
I intended to make abundantly clear that we have made a commitment to help these people help themselves, and we intend to abide by it.
I think that the effort in Viet-Nam is an effort to help liberty-loving people preserve their freedom, and realizing how much we appreciated those who helped us to obtain ours, that we want to help everyone we can preserve theirs.
And our purpose there is to help the people of South Viet-Nam preserve their freedom, and we are doing all we can to do that.
I do not think that that is a question we are dealing with at the moment.
We are working with the existing government as we have been right along.
We will be exchanging views with the spokesmen for the people of South Viet-Nam through Ambassador Taylor and  Johnson and  Bundy.
66 Gen.
Maxwell D.
Taylor, U.
S.
Ambassador to Viet-Nam, U.
Alexis Johnson, Deputy U.
S.
Ambassador to Viet-Nam, and McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
We are making a careful study of our balance-of-payments situation.
We are very concerned with some of the developments of the last quarter, and I plan to submit, after I have adequate staff work done and have recommendations of the Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and the Department of Commerce, our views to the Congress.
Just what specific recommendations we will make has not yet been determined.
We are exploring several possibilities with the departments.
We do intend to maintain the value of gold at $35 an ounce.
We do intend to see that the statement as sound as a dollar is a true statement and that the dollar is sound.
We do intend to take strong action to see that our balance-of-payments situation is improved, and we will have strong and specific recommendations in that field as soon as adequate and thorough study has been given.
I would hope that it would be a matter of the next few days or few weeks, and then we will spell out the specifics.
I told you of what we are doing in that area, that we had just concluded one case in Alabama.
We are today awaiting a decision in that case.
We intend to see that the right to vote is secured for all of our citizens.
We will use the tools of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in every State in the Union in an effort to see that that act is fully observed.
Yes.
I received a memorandum from  Ackley last night saying that he had received some information from a good many of the companies, that other information was being obtained and being supplied and would be from time to time over the next several days and weeks; that he was getting cooperation from the companies involved; that as soon as he had the basic information the Council would evaluate it and would submit it to me, and that he hoped that as much of that information as was not confidential, or not obtained under a classification that it would be confidential, could be released and made public.
I do not anticipate that that information from the companies or from the Council will be available in the next few days.
When it is available I will give it my careful study and if it is appropriate and if it is permissible, I will make the study, as much of it as possible, available to you so the country can know all the facts that are possible.
Thank you,  President.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This March week has brought a very deep and painful challenge to the unending search for American freedom.
That challenge is not yet over, but before it is ended, every resource of this Government will be directed to insuring justice for all men of all races, in Alabama and everywhere in this land.
That is the meaning of the oath that I swore before Almighty God when I took the office of the Presidency.
That is what I believe in with all of my heart.
That is what the people of this country demand.
Last Sunday a group of Negro Americans in Selma, Alabama, attempted peacefully to protest the denial of the most basic political right of allthe right to vote.
They were attacked and some were brutally beaten.
From that moment until this, we have acted effectively to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of Selma, and to prevent further violence and lawlessness in this country wherever it occurred.
More than 70 United States Government officials, including FBI agents, including Justice Department lawyers, Governor Collins, the Assistant Attorney General,  John Doar, whom I asked to go to Selma, have been continuously present in Selma.
They have all been working to keep the peace and to enforce the law.
At all times the full power of the Federal Government has been ready to protect the people of Selma against further lawlessness.
But the final answer to this problem will be found not in armed confrontation, but in the process of law.
We have acted to bring this conflict from the streets to the courtroom.
Your Government, at my direction, asked the Federal court in Alabama to order the law officials of Alabama not to interfere with American citizens who are peacefully demonstrating for their constitutional rights.
When the court has made its order, it must be obeyed.
The events of last Sunday cannot and will not be repeated, but the demonstrations in Selma have a much larger meaning, They are a protest against a deep and very unjust flaw in American democracy itself.
Ninety-five years ago our Constitution was amended to require that no American be denied the right to vote because of race or color.
Almost a century later, many Americans are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.
Therefore, this Monday I will send to the Congress a request for legislation to carry out the amendment of the Constitution.
Wherever there is discrimination, this law will strike down all restrictions used to deny the people the right to vote.
It will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenuous the effort, to flaunt our Constitution.
If State officials refuse to cooperate, then citizens will be registered by Federal officials.
This law is not an effort to punish or coerce anyone.
Its object is one which no American in his heart can truly reject.
It is to give all our people the right to choose their leaders; to deny this right, I think, is to deny democracy itself.
What happened in Selma was an American tragedy.
The blows that were received, the blood that was shed, the life of the good man that was lost, must strengthen the determination of each of us to bring full and equal and exact justice to all of our people.
This is not just the policy of your Government or your President.
It is in the heart and the purpose and the meaning of America itself.
We all know how complex and how difficult it is to bring about basic social change in a democracy, but this complexity must not obscure the clear and simple moral issues.
It is wrong to do violence to peaceful citizens in the streets of their town.
It is wrong to deny Americans the right to vote.
It is wrong to deny any person full equality because of the color of his skin.
The promise of America is a simple promise: Every person shall share in the blessings of this land.
And they shall share on the basis of their merits as a person.
They shall not be judged by their color or by their beliefs, or by their religion, or by where they were born, or the neighborhood in which they live.
All my life I have seen America move closer toward that goal, and every step of the way has brought enlarged opportunity and more happiness for all of our people.
Those who do injustice are as surely the victims of their own acts as the people that they wrong.
They scar their own lives and they scar the communities in which they live.
By turning from hatred to understanding they can insure a richer and fuller life for themselves, as well as for their fellows.
For if we put aside disorder and violence, if we put aside hatred and lawlessness, we can provide for all our people great opportunity almost beyond our imagination.
We will continue this battle for human dignity.
We will apply all the resources of this great and powerful Government to this task.
We ask that all of our citizens unite in this hour of trial.
We will not be moved by anyone or anything from the path of justice.
In this task we will seek the help of the divine power which surpasses the petty barriers between man and man, and people and people.
Under His guidance we can seek the Biblical promise: I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart which shall not be put out.
And we will follow that light until all of us have bowed to the command: Let there be no strife between me and thee, for we be brethren.
I met today with Governor Wallace of Alabama to discuss very thoroughly the situation that exists in that State.
The Governor expressed his concern that the demonstrations which have taken place are a threat to the peace and security of the people of Alabama.
I expressed my own concern about the need for remedying those grievances which lead to the demonstrations by people who feel their rights have been denied.
I said that those Negro citizens of Alabama who have systematically been denied the right to register and to participate in the choice of those who govern them should be provided the opportunity of directing national attention to their plight.
They feel that they are being denied a very precious right.
And I understand their concern.
In his telegram last night to me, Governor Wallace expressed his belief that all eligible citizens are entitled to exercise their right to vote.
He repeated that belief today, and he stated that he is against any discrimination in that regard.
I am firmly convinced, as I said to the Governor a few moments ago, that when all of the eligible Negroes of Alabama have been registered, the economic and the social injustices they have experienced throughout will be righted, and the demonstrations, I believe, will stop.
I advised the Governor of my intention to press with all the vigor at my command to assure that every citizen of this country is given the right to participate in his Government at every level through the complete voting process.
The Governor's expressed interest in law and order met with a warm response.
We are a Nation that is governed by laws, and our procedures for enacting and amending and repealing these laws must prevail.
I told the Governor that we believe in maintaining law and order in every county and in every precinct in this land.
If State and local authorities are unable to function, the Federal Government will completely meet its responsibilities.
I told the Governor that the brutality in Selma last Sunday just must not be repeated.
He agreed that he abhorred brutality and regretted any instance in which any American citizen met with violence.
As the Governor had indicated his desire to take actions to remedy the existing situation in Alabama which caused people to demonstrate, I respectfully suggested to him that he consider the following actions which I believed and the Attorney General and others familiar with the matter, and associated with me, believed would be highly constructive at this stage of the game.
First, I urged that the Governor publicly declare his support for universal suffrage in the State of Alabama, and the United States of America.
Second, I urged him to assure that the right of peaceful assembly will be permitted in Alabama so long as law and order is maintained.
Third, I expressed the hope that the Governor would call a biracial meeting when he returns to Alabama, to seek greater cooperation and to ask for greater unity among Americans of both races.
I asked the Governor for his cooperation and I expressed my appreciation for his coming to Washington to discuss this problem.
I tried to cover that in my statement, but I believe in the right of peaceful assembly.
I believe that people have the right to demonstrate.
I think that you must be concerned with the rights of others.
I do not think a person, as has been said, has the right to holler fire in a crowded theater.
But I think that people should have the right to peacefully assemble, to picket, to demonstrate their views, and to do anything they can to bring those views to the attention of people, provided they do not violate laws themselves, and provided they conduct themselves as they should.
I will have to let the Governor speak for himself.
He is going to appear tomorrow.
We spoke very frankly and very forthrightly.
We exchanged viewsand we are not in agreement on a good many things.
I am hopeful that the visit will be helpful and I did my best to make my viewpoint clear.
The Governor had his share of the conversation.
He told me of the problems that he had in Alabama, the fears that he entertained, and he expressed the hope that I could do something to help bring the demonstrations to an end.
I told him very frankly that I thought our problem, which I had been working on for several weeks now, was to face up to the cause of the demonstration and remove the cause of the demonstration, and that I hoped if he would give assurance that people would be protected in their demonstrations in Alabama, he would give assurance that he would try to improve the voting situation in Alabama, if I could submit my message to the Congress and get prompt action on it that would insure the right of the people of Alabama to vote, that I thought that we could improve the demonstration situation.
I am deeply concerned that our citizens anywhere should be discriminated against and should be denied their constitutional rights.
I have plotted my course.
I have stated my views.
I have made clear, whether the Governor agrees or not, that law and order will prevail in Alabama, that people will betheir rights to peacefully assemble will be preserved, and that their constitutional rights will be protected.
The presence of a good many people from the South in Selma, the presence of some of the ministers from the South here, the messages that I have received from the citizens of that area, the support that the businessmen and the clergy and the labor people have given the Civil Rights Act and its enforcement, have all given me strength and comfort and encouragement.
No, I do not think that I can be much of a prophet in either respect.
First, I do not think that Saigon is the place for the wives and children of our military people at the moment, or else I would not ask for them to come out.
If the situation changes, and conditions are different, I will pass on them in the light of those changes.
I think that anyone that makes a prophecy now as to what the situation will be a year from now would have to be a big guesser.
I have had some conversations with Secretary Rusk concerning that case, and I have complete confidence in the manner in which he will handle it.
I think we have a very difficult situation there as a result of the instability of the governments and the frequent changes of them.
I would not say it has improved in the last 5 weeks.
I would say that our policy there is the policy that was established by President Eisenhower, as I have stated, since I have been President, 46 different times, the policy carried on by President Kennedy, and the policy that we are now carrying on.
I have stated it as recently as February 17th in some detail and prior to that, in my last press conference, on February 4th.
Although the incidents have changed, in some instances the equipment has changed, in some instances the tactics and perhaps the strategy in a decision or two has changed.
Our policy is still the same, and that is to any armed attack, our forces will reply.
To any in southeast Asia who ask our help in defending their freedom, we are going to give it, and that means we are going to continue to give it.
In that region there is nothing that we covet, there is nothing we seek, there is no territory or no military position or no political ambition.
Our one desire and our one determination is that the people of southeast Asia be left in peace to work out their own destinies in their own way.
I would say that the FBI officials, the marshals in the general area, the United States forces, including the Armed Forces, were ready to carry out any instructions that the President gave them, and the President was prepared to give them any instructions that were necessary and justified and wise.
Well, since the Geneva conference of 1962, as has been stated before, the United States has been in rather active and continuous consultation.
We have talked to other governments about the great danger that we could foresee in this aggression in southeast Asia.
We have discussed it in the United Nations.
We have discussed it in NATO We have discussed it in the SEATO councils.
On innumerable occasions we have discussed it directly through diplomatic channels.
We have had direct discussions with almost every signatory of the 1954 and the 1962 pacts.
We have not had any indication, and as the Secretary of State said the other day, what is still missing is any indicationany indicationfrom anyone that Hanoi is prepared or willing or ready to stop doing what it is doing against its neighbors.
I think that the absence of this crucial element affects the current discussion of negotiation.
A great friend of mine who had great responsibilities for a long period of military and executive life in our Government said to me the other day, When I see the suggestions about negotiation, I wonder if folks do not recognize that there must be someone to negotiate with, and there must be someone willing to negotiate.
I know of nothing that either required or justified my making a statement prior to the time that I had a recommendation to make on the problem that was facing us, namely, they were demonstrating about voting rights, and I had that message delivered to me only a few hours ago.
I have reviewed it and am in general agreement on what I am going to send to the Congress.
It happened that I had the time this afternoon to review it and had the information that was available to me.
I think the President should have some leeway when he determines to have press conferences.
I have had 46 since I have been President.
I plan to have at least one once a month.
But the President will determine when they are held, where they are held, and what subjects he discusses.
Speaker,  President, Members of the Congress:I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.
I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause.
At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.
So it was at Lexington and Concord.
So it was a century ago at Appomattox.
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.
There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans.
Many were brutally assaulted.
One good man, a man of God, was killed.
There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma.
There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans.
But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight.
For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great Government  the Government of the greatest Nation on earth.
Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man.
In our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis.
Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues; issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression.
But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself.
Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved Nation.
The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.
And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.
For with a country as with a person, What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?There is no Negro problem.
There is no Southern problem.
There is no Northern problem.
There is only an American problem.
And we are met here tonight as Americans  not as Democrats or Republicanswe are met here as Americans to solve that problem.
This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose.
The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South: All men are created equal  government by consent of the governed  give me liberty or give me death.
Well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories.
In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives.
Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man.
This dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot be found in his power, or in his position.
It really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others.
It says that he shall share in freedom, he shall choose his leaders, educate his children, and provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being.
To apply any other test  to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race, his religion or the place of his birth  is not only to do injustice, it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom.
Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy.
The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders.
The history of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people.
Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult.
But about this there can and should be no argument.
Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote.
There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right.
There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right.
Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.
Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right.
The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent.
And if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application.
And if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test.
The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test.
He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of State law.
And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write.
For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin.
Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination.
No law that we now have on the books  and I have helped to put three of them there  can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it.
In such a case our duty must be clear to all of us.
The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color.
We have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution.
We must now act in obedience to that oath.
Wednesday I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote.
The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders tomorrow.
After they have reviewed it, it will come here formally as a bill.
I am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and to visit with my former colleagues.
I have had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which I will submit to the clerks tonight.
But I want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation.
This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections  federal, state, and local  which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote.
This bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution.
It will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the United States Government if the State officials refuse to register them.
It will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote.
Finally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting.
I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress  I have no doubt that I will get some  on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective.
But experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the Constitution.
To those who seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities; who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections, the answer is simple:Open your polling places to all your people.
Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin.
Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land.
There is no constitutional issue here.
The command of the Constitution is plain.
There is no moral issue.
It is wrong  deadly wrong  to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.
There is no issue of States rights or national rights.
There is only the struggle for human rights.
I have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer.
The last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections.
That civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate.
And when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated.
This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose.
We cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in.
And we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another 8 months before we get a bill.
We have already waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone.
So I ask you to join me in working long hours  nights and weekends, if necessary  to pass this bill.
And I do not make that request lightly.
For from the window where I sit with the problems of our country I recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations, and the harsh judgment of history on our acts.
But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over.
What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America.
It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.
Their cause must be our cause too.
Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.
And we shall overcome.
As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are.
I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society.
But a century has passed, more than a hundred years, since the Negro was freed.
And he is not fully free tonight.
It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln, a great President of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact.
A century has passed, more than a hundred years, since equality was promised.
And yet the Negro is not equal.
A century has passed since the day of promise.
And the promise is unkept.
The time of justice has now come.
I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back.
It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come.
And when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.
For Negroes are not the only victims.
How many white children have gone uneducated, how many white families have lived in stark poverty, how many white lives have been scarred by fear, because we have wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror?So I say to all of you here, and to all in the Nation tonight, that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future.
This great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all: black and white, North and South, sharecropper and city dweller.
These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease.
They are the enemies and not our fellow man, not our neighbor.
And these enemies too, poverty, disease and ignorance, we shall overcome.
Now let none of us in any sections look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section, or on the problems of our neighbors.
There is really no part of America where the promise of equality has been fully kept.
In Buffalo as well as in Birmingham, in Philadelphia as well as in Selma, Americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom.
This is one Nation.
What happens in Selma or in Cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every American.
But let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities, and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists.
As we meet here in this peaceful, historic chamber tonight, men from the South, some of whom were at Iwo Jima, men from the North who have carried Old Glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it, men from the East and from the West, are all fighting together without regard to religion, or color, or region, in Viet-Nam.
Men from every region fought for us across the world 20 years ago.
And in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the South made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great Republic  and in some instances, a great many of them, more.
And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Golden Gate to the harbors along the Atlantic, will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all Americans.
For all of us owe this duty; and I believe that all of us will respond to it.
Your President makes that request of every American.
The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro.
His actions and protests, his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life, have awakened the conscience of this Nation.
His demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice, designed to provoke change, designed to stir reform.
He has called upon us to make good the promise of America.
And who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in American democracy.
For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep-seated belief in the democratic process.
Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but upon the force of moral right; not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order.
There have been many pressures upon your President and there will be others as the days come and go.
But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought: in the courts, and in the Congress, and in the hearts of men.
We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly.
But the right of free speech does not carry with it, as has been said, the right to holler fire in a crowded theater.
We must preserve the right to free assembly, but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic.
We do have a right to protest, and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors.
And I intend to protect all those rights as long as I am permitted to serve in this office.
We will guard against violence, knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek  progress, obedience to law, and belief in American values.
In Selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace.
We seek order.
We seek unity.
But we will not accept the peace of stifled rights, or the order imposed by fear, or the unity that stifles protest.
For peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty.
In Selma tonight, as in every  and we had a good day there  as inevery city, we are working for just and peaceful settlement.
We must all remember that after this speech I am making tonight, after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone, and after you have promptly passed this bill, the people of Selma and the other cities of the Nation must still live and work together.
And when the attention of the Nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community.
This cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence, as the history of the South itself shows.
It is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days  last Tuesday, again today.
The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill.
But, in a larger sense, most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program.
Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races.
Because all Americans just must have the right to vote.
And we are going to give them that right.
All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race.
And they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race.
But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right.
It requires a trained mind and a healthy body.
It requires a decent home, and the chance to find a job, and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty.
Of course, people cannot contribute to the Nation if they are never taught to read or write, if their bodies are stunted from hunger, if their sickness goes untended, if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check.
So we want to open the gates to opportunity.
But we are alsogoing to give all our people, black and white, the help that they need to walkthrough those gates.
My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla, Texas, in a small Mexican-American school.
Few of them could speak English, and I could not speak much Spanish.
My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast, hungry.
They knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice.
They never seemed to know why people disliked them.
But they knew it was so, because I saw it in their eyes.
I often walked home late in the afternoon, after the classes were finished, wishing there was more that I could do.
But all I knew was to teach them the little that I knew, hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead.
Somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child.
I never thought then, in 1928, that I would be standing here in 1965.
It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country.
But now I do have that chance  and I will let you in on a secret  I mean to use it.
And I hope that you will use it with me.
This is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe.
The might of past empires is little compared to ours.
But I do not want to be the President who built empires, or sought grandeur, or extended dominion.
I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world.
I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of tax-eaters.
I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election.
I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties.
I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth.
And so at the request of your beloved Speaker and the Senator from Montana; the majority leader, the Senator from Illinois; the minority leader,  McCulloch, and other Members of both parties, I came here tonight  not as President Roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill, not as President Truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill  but I came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for.
I want this to be the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, which did all these things for all these people.
Beyond this great chamber, out yonder in 50 States, are the people that we serve.
Who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen.
We all can guess, from our own lives, how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness, how many problems each little family has.
They look most of all to themselves for their futures.
But I think that they also look to each of us.
Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says  in Latin  God has favored our undertaking.
God will not favor everything that we do.
It is rather our duty to divine His will.
But I cannot help believing that He truly understands and that He really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the LBJ Ranch.
I hope you enjoy your stay and can bring the temperature up a little while you are here.
I have today sent the following telegram to the Honorable George Wallace, Governor of Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama:Responsibility for maintaining law and order in our Federal system properly rests with the State and local government.
On the basis of your public statements and your discussions with me, I thought that you felt strongly about this and had indicated that you would take all the necessary action in this regard.
I was surprised, therefore, when in your telegram of Thursday you requested Federal assistance in the performance of such fundamental State duties.
Even more surprising was your telegram of yesterday stating that both you and the Alabama Legislature, because of monetary consideration, believe that the State is unable to protect American citizens and to maintain peace and order in a responsible manner without Federal forces.
Because the court order must be obeyed and the rights of all American citizens must be protected, I intend to meet your request by providing Federal assistance to perform normal police functions.
I am calling into Federal service selected units of the Alabama National Guard, and also will have available police units from the Regular Army to help you meet your State responsibilities.
These forces should be adequate to assure the rights of American citizens pursuant to a Federal court order to walk peaceably and safely without injury or loss of life from Selma to Montgomery, AlaLYNDON B.
JOHNSONIt is not a welcome duty for the Federal Government to ever assume a State Government's own responsibility for assuring the protection of citizens in the exercise of their constitutional rights.
It has been rare in our history for the Governor and the legislature of a sovereign State to decline to exercise their responsibility and to request that duty be assumed by the Federal Government.
Governor Wallace and the legislature of the State of Alabama have now done this.
I have responded both to their request and to what I believe is the sure and the certain duty of the Federal Government in the protection of constitutional rights of all American citizens.
I have called selected elements of the Alabama National Guard into Federal Service.
Additionally, I have military police put in position at both Selma and Montgomery, Alabama.
In addition, we have Federal marshals, FBI agents on duty in that area at this time.
Last evening I dispatched Deputy Attorney General Ramsey Clark to the scene to coordinate all the National Government's activities.
He is assisted by the very able Burke Marshall and John Doar and some other dozen able lawyers from the Department of Justice.
Over the next several days the eyes of the Nation will be upon Alabama, and the eyes of the world will be upon America.
It is my prayer, a prayer in which I hope all Americans will join me earnestly today, that the march in Alabama may proceed in a manner honoring our heritage and honoring all for which America stands.
May this, the conduct of all Americans, demonstrate beyond dispute that the true strength of America lies not in arms and not in force and not in the might of the military or in the police, nor in the multitudes of marshals and State troopers but in respect and obedience to law itself.
In other times a great PresidentPresident Abraham Lincolnsaid that he was confident that we would be touched by the better angels of our nature.
That is my hope for you, and my expectation of all of you and my prayer to all of you today.
A nation is molded by the tests that its peoples meet and master.
I believe that from the test of these days we shall emerge as a stronger nation, as a more united people, and a more just and decent society.
I will now pass to another subject-to Viet-Nam.
I want to announce this morning that Ambassador Maxwell Taylor will shortly resume his periodic visits to Washington for consultations on the Viet-Nam situation.
He will return to Washington on March 28 and will remain approximately a week.
There are no immediate issues which make the meeting urgent.
It is a regularrepeatregular periodic visit, part of our continuous consultations to make sure that our effort in Viet-Nam is as effective and as efficient as possible.
Let me say this additionally on Viet-Nam.
One year ago on March 17, 1964, I made this statement, and I quote: For 10 years, under three Presidents, this Nation has been determined to help a brave people to resist aggression and terror.
It is and it will remain the policy of the United States to furnish assistance to support South Viet-Nam for as long as is required to bring Communist aggression and terrorism under control.
Our policy in Viet-Nam is the same as it was 1 year ago, and to those of you who have inquiries on the subject, it is the same as it was 10 years ago.
I have publicly stated it.
I have reviewed it to the Congress in joint sessions.
I have reviewed it in various messages to the Congress and I have talked individually with more than 500 of them stating the policy and asking and answering questions on that subject in the last 60 days.
In addition, I have stated this policy to the press and to the public in almost every State in the Union.
Specifically last night I read where I had made the policy statement 47 times.
Well, I want to repeat it again this morning for your information and for emphasis.
Under this policy, changes in the situation may require from time to time changes in tactics, in strategy, in equipment, in personnel.
As I said last month, the continuing actions we take will be those that are justified and made necessary by the continuing aggression of others.
These aggressors serve no peaceful interest, not even their own.
No one threatens their regime.
There is no intent or desire to conquer them or to occupy their land.
What is wanted is simply that they carry out their agreements, that they end their aggression against their neighbors.
The real goal of all of us in southeast Asia must be the peaceful progress of the people of that area.
They have the right to live side by side in peace and independence.
And if this little country does not have that fight then the question is what will happen to the other hundred little countries who want to preserve that right.
They have a right to build a new sense of community among themselves.
They have a right to join, with help from others, in the full development of their own resources for their own benefit.
They have a right to live together without fear or oppression or domination from any quarter of this entire globe.
So this is the peace for which the United States of America works today.
This is the peace which aggression from the north today prevents.
This is the peace which will remain the steadfast goal of the United States of America.
On Monday I shall have been in the Presidential office for 16 months.
Whatever the accomplishments of this period no one knows better than I how much credit is due the ability and integrity and outstanding quality of the men and women who serve the executive branch.
We have between 3 and 4 million people working in the military and civilian services.
I believe the quality of talent and capacity in the top positions of the Federal Government, and in the other positions as well, is without parallel in modern times.
This high level of quality is going to be maintained.
I am determined that the American people shall be served by the very best talent available, chosen on the basis of principles and performance, not politics or speculation.
Since November 1963 I have made a total of 163 major appointments through today.
Of the 135 nonjudicial appointments almost exactly half, 49 percent, have been purely merit appointments made from the career service of the Government or other Government background.
Fourteen percent additionally have come from university careers, 16 percent from business and labor, 19 percent from the legal profession.
And I would like to add they have included both Republicans and Democrats.
This week I was privileged to announce the appointment of former Under Secretary Henry Fowler to succeed Douglas Dillon in the Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury.
Today,  John Macy has brought to the Ranch seven outstanding men and I am nominating them to serve in positions of major responsibility.
The press will receive detailed biographical information on each.
I want to announce their appointments and present these gentlemen to you this morning.
For the position of Federal Cochairman of the Appalachian Commission established by the act that I signed just a week ago, I have selected  John L.
Sweeney of Michigan.
This outstanding young man served as the Chairman of the Federal Development Planning Committee for Appalachia with great distinction and was a key figure in developing the program that he will now administer.
Next, on the Federal Power Commission, I am reappointing a public servant from the State of Vermont who has demonstrated his commitment to the public interest,  Charles R.
Ross of Vermont.
To fill the vacancy on the Federal Power Commission, I am nominating an outstanding Republican attorney from the State of Illinois, a Phi Beta Kappa, a lecturer in universities abroad, a leader in Young Republican activities who is presently serving as the general counsel of the Santa Fe Railroad Carl E.
Bagge.
On the Civil Aeronautics Board, I am making a merit appointment of a career public servant who has served as chief of the CAB's three major operating divisions,  John G.
Adams of South Dakota.
On the National Labor Relations Board, I am proud to announce the nomination of a former member of the working press, a registered Republican who has served for 10 years as administrative assistant to the Republican Senior Senator from New Jersey,  Clifford Case.
He is  Sam Zagoria of New Jersey.
For the position of Under Secretary of the Army I am nominating an honor graduate of Yale University and the Yale Law School, a Silver Star Army veteran of World War II, a member of the New York Young Republicans, and now a member of a major New York law firm Stanley Resor.
I am very proud of these citizens and I am grateful for their unselfishness.
I wish to announce now the last appointment,  Howard Woods of  Louis, Missouri to be an Associate Director of the United States Information Agency.
Woods is a worthy journalist.
He will be one of two Associate Directors for this very important agency.
He will have special responsibility for planning USIA activities in underdeveloped countries, particularly those that are trying to build their communications systems so as to increase the contact of these governments with their people.
As you may know,  Woods has been the reporter, the columnist, the city editor, the publisher of the  Louis Argus,  Louis, Missouri.
Carl T.
Rowan, the Director of USIA has told me he is increasing substantially USIA activities in countries such as Viet-Nam which are caught up in new style Communist aggression.
Woods will join us to help plan and direct this broadened program.
So this morning the score card is 3 Republicans, 3 Democrats, and 1 Independent.
Finally, because of the very considerable interest and discussions concerning the President's press policies I want to give you some idea of what you may plan and what you may expect in the days to come.
First of all, I regard my own responsibility in this field as making available to all of you all of the information that I can, consistent with the national interest, on as fair and as equitable basis as possible.
How and where I do that is a decision that I reserve for myself, and I shall continue to reserve for myself.
Second, I consider it the responsibility of the press to report those facts to the American public as fully as possible and in the best perspective possible.
The press, of course, also has the right and has the duty to comment on the facts in any way it sees fit.
But that is a right and not a responsibility.
Therefore, I plan to see the press at many different times in many different ways if you are willing.
I will, however, try to follow the standing practice of holding at least one press conference a month of the nature which you describe as ample advance notice, coverage by all media, full dresseven white ties if you choose.
I do not intend to restrict myself to this as the sole form of seeing the press, but I will try to state it as a very minimum.
Today marks the 39th on-the-record press conference that I have held, 18 off-the-record, or a total of 57.
I have had 18 press conferences with adequate advance notice, 16 covered by radio and television.
Eight of these were live television in addition to 3 live television joint sessions in the little over a year that I have been President.
There have been other occasions upon which I have seen the White House press corps on an informal basis in order to give them some insight into my thinking.
In addition to these 56 formal meetings I have had 9 informal, lengthy walks with the White House press corps.
Some of you who used to enjoy those walks when they were scheduled a little earlier with President Truman and from time to time those of you who enjoy them will be invited back again.
On various occasions I have had conferences with pools representing the White House press.
We have had 173 airplane flights with pools where they visitedtwo pool visits while I was in the hospital with a bad cold, and one pool visit in my bedroom in the Executive Mansion when I thought I was recuperating from it.
I have had additional visits from 374 accredited press representatives at their request; in addition, 64 who requested meetings with bureau chiefs, plus 200 telephone discussions that I have responded to.
There have been 9 other occasions where I have met with the press ranging from a barbecue at the Ranch to addresses made to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Associated Press luncheon, and of course last year each one of the social affairs, White House press conference and gridiron etc.
, I believe numbered 8.
I have had 9 special appearances ranging from a television interview with all 3 networks to special statements concerning Viet-Nam and the railroad strike.
A considerable amount of my time has been spent with the press in this effort to discharge what I consider to be the President's responsibility to this country.
I think that it is necessary to do this because the press is the media through which the American people are informed and as I said, I intend to continue to bring them all the information that is possible and to see that every Cabinet officer and every head of an independent agency does the same thing.
Insofar as the President is concerned, I will continue seeing the press at different times, different places, and different ways at my own choosing.
I am ready for any questions.
We anticipate the march will have been concluded by that period and we cannot tell at this time any reason why it should go beyond that.
If it is necessary, we will take appropriate action at an appropriate time.
Well, for the moment we have called up 1,863 National Guardsmen.
In addition, we have approximately 100 FBI men.
We have approximately 75 to 100 marshals that are present; others will join them later in the day.
In addition, we have 500 men in place from Ft.
Bragg that are now at Maxwell Field, Montgomery.
In addition to that, we have 509 men at the moment in place at Craig Field, Selma.
On alert, we have a reinforced battalion at Ft.
Benning, that can be there on short notice, of an additional thousand men.
One company can be ready to move and be there in a very few hours.
The others are alerted.
These military forces are being placed under the command of Brig.
Gen.
Henry Graham, who, some of you will remember, is the assistant division commander of the 31st Infantry Division.
He was the Guardsman commander of the forces that were federalized at Tuscaloosa.
He is assisted by a Regular Army man, Brig.
Gen.
James M.
Wright.
I do not want to leave such an impression.
I want to correct it if I have left the wrong impression.
What motivates Governor Wallace is a matter that he can discuss with you better than I can.
He has his responsibilities and he is going to exercise them according to his judgment and his views, and I plan to do the same thing.
I just repeated the statement he made in his wire.
We are keeping in very close touch with the leaders of the march.
We have reasonably accurate estimates of how many we think will be included.
We have medical forces in the general area.
They have been alerted to take care of any needs that may arise, and we hope and pray that there will be none.
We have a 75-bed hospital with 5 doctors and 5 ambulances, 43 aircraft, helicopters (5-ambulatory patient, 2 litters with corpsmen).
This is located at Craig in Selma.
At Maxwell Field we have a 250-bed hospital, 50 doctors, 5 ambulances, 4 H-43 aircraft.
We trust it will not be necessary to use any of these, but we have taken the precaution, and there is hardly a day passes but what the President is asked to provide medical service to some citizen where it is not available from other sources, and we do that in all instances where it is justified.
We have been constantly in touch with him, General Katzenbach, and other members of the executive branch in Washington and here.
Since I received his wire the other evening I have not talked to him, have not talked to any of his people, but our people are talking to him with regularity and trying to give such counsel and guidance as we think will be helpful.
We do not discuss iffy questions like that.
We will give consideration to the problems and the needs of the various nations and countries, and while we have them under consideration we will try to evaluate them and if a decision is reached in any area with any country, why we will carry it out.
But we do not think that it is desirable to speculate or to engage in any prophecies that may or may not work out.
The administration has made its proposals in the form of legislation pending before the House committee.
There will be a number of amendments added to that and a number of changes, and my own personal view is included in the recommendations in that bill which is available to you.
I should have liked to have gone further if I thought I could have without a constitutional amendment, if I could have done it by statute in other respects concerning voting, but the legal talents available did not think that we could make these additions.
The final judgment of just how far we do go in connection with literacy and qualifications of the electors will be determined by the two judiciary committees made up of lawyers and the other Members of the Congress.
Very frankly, I would like to have included in the message a provision that would permit all people over 18 years of age to vote, but the lawyers felt that would complicate the matter and that it should be approached otherwise.
But specifically answering your question, what final action will be taken in the bill that is sent to me will be determined by what is going on now, and I hope that they will work every morning and afternoon and night and that we can have legislation very shortly.
I would not want to tell you or them or the country any of our evaluation of military operations at this time.
We are being as effective and as efficient as we know how.
We have our policy of responding appropriately, fittingly, and measured.
We are doing everything that we know to try to bring about freedom for South Viet-Nam and peace in that area.
That was the policy that General Eisenhower announced when he was President when we assumed responsibilities there.
That was the policy provided for in the SEATO Treaty that passed the Senate 82 to 1, which obligates us to the commitment we have made there.
That was the policy that was incorporated in the resolution passed August the 10th by the Congress.
But to give a day-to-day evaluation of what effect this strike or that strike might have would not only contribute, I think, to confusion and perhaps might be inaccurate, but would be ill advised, I think.
Well, we sent them a wire congratulating them and expressing our good wishes for the successful outcome of one of their tests.
Administrator Webb is here today.
He came in last night from New Mexico where he has been on an official visit.
I asked him to be here this morning.
He and I have reviewed the Russian activity in space this week, as well as our own planned activity next week.
The Soviet accomplishment and our own scheduled efforts demonstrate, I think, dramatically and convincingly the important role that man himself will play in the exploration of the space frontier.
The continuing efforts of both our program and the Russian program will steadily produce new capabilities and new space activities.
These capabilities, in my judgment, will help each nation achieve broader confidence to do what they consider they ought to do in space.
I have felt since the days when I introduced the space act and sat studying Sputnik I and Sputnik II that it was really a mistake to regard space exploration as a contest which can be tallied on any box score.
Judgments can be made only by considering all the objectives of the two national programs, and they will vary and they will differ.
Our own program is very broadly based.
We believe very confidently in the United States that we will produce contributions that we need at the time we need them.
For that reason I gave  Webb and his group every dollar in the budget this year that they asked for, for a manned space flight.
Now the progress of our program is very satisfactory to me in every respect.
We are committed to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.
We stressed that in our hearings and our legislation when we passed the bill.
And while the Soviet is ahead of us in some aspects of space, U.
S.
leadership is clear and decisive and we are ahead of them in other realms on which we have particularly concentrated.
If it is not an imposition on you and if you care toI have not consulted himbut after the conference is over, if you are not in too big a hurry to get back to the Driskill,  Webb will be here and he will answer any questions you may want to ask him.
I think you have stated the facts that are available to all of us.
The people on the ground are taking judicious notice of the entire situation.
We hope that we have taken the necessary precautions and we are adequately prepared to deal with whatever may develop.
But I think it would be a great mistake to predict disaster, and I think that we have the people that have the training and that will carry out the normal police functions, and I hope we have the patriotism on every side of the question and on all viewpoints to obey law and order and to respond to my plea this morning that we conduct ourselves as law-abiding Americans who want to unite our country instead of divide it.
I think our position is all right at the present time.
I never know what any statementwhat effect it may have on some other person.
We have freedom of speech in this country, and that is one of the things that we are working toward in our calling up the Guard last night, and we have freedom of assembly, and I have observed no lack of it in Congress; in the time I have been there in 35 years I have seen no restraints imposed by anybody.
I have never discussed with a human being something he should say or should not say on Viet-Nam.
I think debate is healthy, it is good for us, provided it is responsible.
And I think we have had debate.
I have met with 520, I believe, Congressmen and Senators for over 2 hours for over 11 nights, and each one of them could ask any question he wanted to.
The Secretary of State gave them a thorough briefingthe Secretary of Defense, the President, and the Vice President.
And as I stated, you have raised the question with me 47 times.
We have covered it very good.
So maybe the Senators and Congressmen have some speeches left in order to be even with us.
Thank you,  President.
Webb,  Vice President, Members of the Senate and the House:This is a very proud and a very happy occasion for all of us here, and I think it is a proud and happy occasion for all Americans everywhere.
We intended to conduct this ceremony this morning outside in the Rose Garden.
However, Major Grissom and Commander Young found their landing in Washington this morning only slightly less wet than their landing in the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday.
So we meet now in the famous East Room of the White House.
I think it is fitting that we should assemble for this purpose in this historic and hallowed room.
For 165 years this room has witnessed great moments of our history, and it has known great men of our past, from John Adams to John Kennedy.
A sense of history is present strongly here today.
All of us are conscious that we have crossed over the threshold of man's first tentative and experimental ventures in space.
The question of whether there would be a role for man himself in space is already firmly and finally answered, and answered affirmatively.
Man's role in space will be great, it will be vital, and it will be useful.
Equally important, we can comprehend now better than we ever have been able to in the past that the role of space in the life of man on earth will also be great and vital and useful.
So in this springtime of 1965 it seems incredible that it was only four springtimes ago when young Americans, including Gus Grissom, first flew into space.
We have come very far in a very few short years.
Yet the quickening pace of our advance will carry us far beyond this point of achievement even before one more year passes.
The program we pursue now is a planned and orderly program with but one purpose-the purpose of exploring space for the service of peace and the benefit of all mankind here on this earth.
We are not concerned with stunts and spectaculars, but we are concerned with sure and with steady success.
Since we gave our program direction and purpose 7 years ago, many such successes have been achieved through the efforts of a great American team, which now numbers 400,000 men and women in industry, on campuses, and in government.
And this team is inspired and stimulated and led by a former Marine and a great public servant-Jim Webb.
We have come here today to honor just 4 of these 400,000 men on his team.
We honor Gus Grissom, the first man to make two flights into space, and we honor both Gus Grissom and John Young as command pilot and pilot of our first two-man Gemini spacecraft flight.
We honor the Director of Project Ranger,  Bud Schurmeier.
He has led the team which produced for us and for all mankind the most dramatic advance in our knowledge of the moon.
We also honor one of this Nation's most dedicated and most valuable public servants, the top career man of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  Robert Seamans.
As general manager of our civilian space effort,  Seamans has performed absolutely magnificently.
All Americans and all free men are in his debt.
Through these four we honor all who have and who are contributing to America's effort to advance the horizon of human knowledge.
This is a happy day in our Nation's Capital.
It is a proud day for Americans everywhere, and I know it must be especially proud for the parents and the wives and the families of these two brave, patriotic, gallant, and exceptional young Americans, and it gives me much pleasure to be able to have them here in this first house of the land.
And now, I want to thank each of you for coming here and participating with us.
I am going to ask Administrator Webb to read the citations for these outstanding pioneers of the new age of space.
Webb.
This is a great day for all America.
I just wish it were possible for the two great Presidents who provided such outstanding leadership in this fieldPresident Eisenhower and President Kennedyto be here to share these pleasures and joys with us.
It was during President Eisenhower's administration that the space agency was born, and under his leadership that it grew and developed.
It was President Kennedy's vision that brought about some of the things that we are here applauding today.
I see in this room nowI guess we do not have room up here for everyone who has played a vital part, but back when the Space Administration was created and from that time until this hour, there has been complete bipartisanship, and members of both parties have provided leadership in uniting behind the Space Administrator and these fine young men who brought us the accomplishments that we are applauding today.
So I would like to ask the Members of the House and the Senate and their leaders and the chairmen of their committees to stand now and let us give the Congress a hand for the part that it has played in bringing into effect what we are so proud of.
Congressman George Miller of California is chairman of the House Space Committee, and Senator Anderson of New Mexico is chairman of the Senate Space Committee.
We thank all the Members of Congress of both parties and we are delighted to have had you and we hope you enjoy the day.
My fellow Americans: In this historic room where just a few minutes ago we honored brave men and great American achievements we have come now to talk about a tragedy and a stain on our American society.
I am certain by now that all of you know of the horrible crime which was committed last night between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama.
I have been in constant touch with the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI,  J.
Edgar Hoover, throughout the night on this matter.
Due to the very fast and the always efficient work of the special agents of the FBI who worked all night long, starting immediately after the tragic death of  Viola Liuzzo on a lonely road between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, arrests were made a few minutes ago of four Ku Klux Klan members in Birmingham, Alabama, charging them with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the murdered woman.
J.
Edgar Hoover, our honored public servant who is standing here by me, has advised that the identities of the men charged with this heinous crime are as follows: Eugene Thomas, age 43, of Bessemer; William Orville Eaton, age 41, also of Bessemer; Gary Thomas Rowe, , age 31, of Birmingham; and Collie Leroy Wilkins, , age 21, of Fairfield, Alabama.
I cannot express myself too strongly in praising  Hoover and the men of the FBI for their prompt and expeditious and very excellent performance in handling this investigation.
It is in keeping with the dedicated approach that this organization has shown throughout the turbulent era of civil rights controversies.
This Nation and its President are very grateful for the highly intelligent and tireless efforts of the distinguished Attorney General, Nicholas Katzenbach, and his many associates who have carried the Government's fight to insure the rights of all citizens guaranteed to them by the Constitution.
The four members of the United Klans of America, Inc.
, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, will of course be arraigned immediately.
They will later stand trial.
Liuzzo went to Alabama to serve the struggle for justice.
She was murdered by the enemies of justice who for decades have used the rope and the gun and the tar and the feathers to terrorize their neighbors.
They struck by night, as they generally do, for their purpose cannot stand the light of day.
My father fought them many long years ago in Texas and I have fought them all my life because I believe them to threaten the peace of every community where they exist.
I shall continue to fight them because I know their loyalty is not to the United States of America but instead to a hooded society of bigots.
Men and women have stood against the Klan at times and at places where to do so required a continuous act of courage.
So if Klansmen hear my voice today, let it be both an appeal and a warning to get out of the Ku Klux Klan now and return to a decent society before it is too late.
I call on every law enforcement officer in America to insist on obedience to the law and to insist on respect for justice.
No nation can long endure either in history's judgment or in its own national conscience if hoodlums or bigots can defy the law and can get away with it.
Justice must be done in the largest city as well as the smallest village, on the dirt road or on the interstate highway.
We will not be intimidated by the terrorists of the Ku Klux Klan any more than we will be intimidated by the terrorists in North Viet-Nam.
We will reduce the sacrifices of those who suffer now in a society free of the Klan and those who support its vicious work.
I am asking and directing Attorney General Katzenbach to proceed at the earliest possible date to develop legislation that will bring the activities of the Klan under effective control of the law, and I am hopeful that that legislation can be submitted just as soon as we can get the present voters' rights legislation through the Congress.
In connection with new legislation, congressional committees may wish to investigate the activities of such organizations and the part that they play in instigating violence.
And I hope that if the congressional committees do decide to proceed forthwith, they can be assured of the cooperation of all patriotic Americans and certainly we will make all the resources of the Federal Government, the Justice Department, and FBI available to them.
Garland, Senator Brewster, Senator Tydings, Members of the congressional delegation, members of the faculty of Johns Hopkins, student body, my fellow Americans.
Last week 17 nations sent their views to some two dozen countries having an interest in southeast Asia.
We are joining those 17 countriesand stating our American policy tonight which we believe will contribute toward peace in this area of the world.
I have come here to review once again with my own people the views of the American Government.
Tonight Americans and Asians are dying for a world where each people may choose its own path to change.
This is the principle for which our ancestors fought in the valleys of Pennsylvania.
It is the principle for which our sons fight tonight in the jungles of Viet-Nam.
Viet-Nam is far away from this quiet campus.
We have no territory there, nor do we seek any.
The war is dirty and brutal and difficult.
And some 400 young men, born into an America that is bursting with opportunity and promise, have ended their lives on Viet-Nam's steaming soil.
Why must we take this painful road?Why must this Nation hazard its ease, and its interest, and its power for the sake of a people so far away?We fight because we must fight if we are to live in a world where every country can shape its own destiny.
And only in such a world will our own freedom be finally secure.
This kind of world will never be built by bombs or bullets.
Yet the infirmities of man are such that force must often precede reason, and the waste of war, the works of peace.
We wish that this were not so.
But we must deal with the world as it is, if it is ever to be as we wish.
The world as it is in Asia is not a serene or peaceful place.
The first reality is that North Viet-Nam has attacked the independent nation of South Viet-Nam.
Its object is total conquest.
Of course, some of the people of South Viet-Nam are participating in attack on their own government.
But trained men and supplies, orders and arms, flow in a constant stream from north to south.
This support is the heartbeat of the war.
And it is a war of unparalleled brutality.
Simple farmers are the targets of assassination and kidnapping.
Women and children are strangled in the night because their men are loyal to their government.
And help less villages are ravaged by sneak attacks.
Large-scale raids are conducted on towns, and terror strikes in the heart of cities.
The confused nature of this conflict cannot mask the fact that it is the new face of an old enemy.
Over this warand all Asiais another reality: the deepening shadow of Communist China.
The rulers in Hanoi are urged on by Peking.
This is a regime which has destroyed freedom in Tibet, which has attacked India, and has been condemned by the United Nations for aggression in Korea.
It is a nation which is helping the forces of violence in almost every continent.
The contest in Viet-Nam is part of a wider pattern of aggressive purposes.
Why are these realities our concern? Why are we in South Viet-Nam ?We are there because we have a promise to keep.
Since 1954 every American President has offered support to the people of South Viet-Nam.
We have helped to build, and we have helped to defend.
Thus, over many years, we have made a national pledge to he!p South Viet-Nam defend its independence.
And I intend to keep that promise.
To dishonor that pledge, to abandon this small and brave nation to its enemies, and to the terror that must follow, would be an unforgivable wrong.
We are also there to strengthen world order.
Around the globe, from Berlin to Thailand, are people whose well-being rests, in part, on the belief that they can count on us if they are attacked.
To leave Viet-Nam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of an American commitment and in the value of America's word.
The result would be increased unrest and instability, and even wider war.
We are also there because there are great stakes in the balance.
Let no one think for a moment that retreat from Viet-Nam would bring an end to conflict.
The battle would be renewed in one country and then another.
The central lesson of our time is that the appetite of aggression is never satisfied.
To withdraw from one battlefield means only to prepare for the next.
We must say in southeast Asiaas we did in Europein the words of the Bible: Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further.
There are those who say that all our effort there will be futilethat China's power is such that it is bound to dominate all southeast Asia.
But there is no end to that argument until all of the nations of Asia are swallowed up.
There are those who wonder why we have a responsibility there.
Well, we have it there for the same reason that we have a responsibility for the defense of Europe.
World War II was fought in both Europe and Asia, and when it ended we found ourselves with continued responsibility for the defense of freedom.
Our objective is the independence of South Viet-Nam, and its freedom from attack.
We want nothing for ourselvesonly that the people of South Viet-Nam be allowed to guide their own country in their own way.
We will do everything necessary to reach that objective.
And we will do only what is absolutely necessary.
In recent months attacks on South Viet-Nam were stepped up.
Thus, it became necessary for us to increase our response and to make attacks by air.
This is not a change of purpose.
It is a change in what we believe that purpose requires.
We do this in order to slow down aggression.
We do this to increase the confidence of the brave people of South Viet-Nam who have bravely borne this brutal battle for so many years with so many casualties.
And we do this to convince the leaders of North Viet-Namand all who seek to share their conquestof a very simple fact: We will not be defeated.
We will not grow tired.
We will not withdraw, either openly or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement.
We know that air attacks alone will not accomplish all of these purposes.
But it is our best and prayerful judgment that they are a necessary part of the surest road to peace.
We hope that peace will come swiftly.
But that is in the hands of others besides ourselves.
And we must be prepared for a long continued conflict.
It will require patience as well as bravery, the will to endure as well as the will to resist.
I wish it were possible to convince others with words of what we now find it necessary to say with guns and planes: Armed hostility is futile.
Our resources are equal to any challenge.
Because we fight for values and we fight for principles, rather than territory or colonies, our patience and our determination are unending.
Once this is clear, then it should also be clear that the only path for reasonable men is the path of peaceful settlement.
Such peace demands an independent South Viet-Namsecurely guaranteed and able to shape its own relationships to all others-free from outside interferencetied to no alliancea military base for no other country.
These are the essentials of any final settlement.
We will never be second in the search for such a peaceful settlement in Viet-Nam.
There may be many ways to this kind of peace: in discussion or negotiation with the governments concerned; in large groups or in small ones; in the reaffirmation of old agreements or their strengthening with new ones.
We have stated this position over and over again, fifty times and more, to friend and foe alike.
And we remain ready, with this purpose, for unconditional discussions.
And until that bright and necessary day of peace we will try to keep conflict from spreading.
We have no desire to see thousands die in battleAsians or Americans.
We have no desire to devastate that which the people of North Viet-Nam have built with toil and sacrifice.
We will use our power with restraint and with all the wisdom that we can command.
But we will use it.
This war, like most wars, is filled with terrible irony.
For what do the people of North Viet-Nam want? They want what their neighbors also desire: food for their hunger; health for their bodies; a chance to learn; progress for their country; and an end to the bondage of material misery.
And they would find all these things far more readily in peaceful association with others than in the endless course of battle.
These countries of southeast Asia are homes for millions of impoverished people.
Each day these people rise at dawn and struggle through until the night to wrestle existence from the soil.
They are often wracked by disease, plagued by hunger, and death comes at the early age of 40.
Stability and peace do not come easily in such a land.
Neither independence nor human dignity will ever be won, though, by arms alone.
It also requires the work of peace.
The American people have helped generously in times past in these works.
Now there must be a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict-torn corner of our world.
The first step is for the countries of southeast Asia to associate themselves in a greatly expanded cooperative effort for development.
We would hope that North Viet-Nam would take its place in the common effort just as soon as peaceful cooperation is possible.
The United Nations is already actively engaged in development in this area.
As far back as 1961 I conferred with our authorities in Viet-Nam in connection with their work there.
And I would hope tonight that the Secretary General of the United Nations could use the prestige of his great office, and his deep knowledge of Asia, to initiate, as soon as possible, with the countries of that area, a plan for cooperation in increased development.
For our part I will ask the Congress to join in a billion dollar American investment in this effort as soon as it is underway.
And I would hope that all other industrialized countries, including the Soviet Union, will join in this effort to replace despair with hope, and terror with progress.
The task is nothing less than to enrich the hopes and the existence of more than a hundred million people.
And there is much to be done.
The vast Mekong River can provide food and water and power on a scale to dwarf even our own TVAThe wonders of modern medicine can be spread through villages where thousands die every year from lack of care.
Schools can be established to train people in the skills that are needed to manage the process of development.
And these objectives, and more, are within the reach of a cooperative and determined effort.
I also intend to expand and speed up a program to make available our farm surpluses to assist in feeding and clothing the needy in Asia.
We should not allow people to go hungry and wear rags while our own warehouses overflow with an abundance of wheat and corn, rice and cotton.
So I will very shortly name a special team of outstanding, patriotic, distinguished Americans to inaugurate our participation in these programs.
This team will be headed by  Eugene Black, the very able former President of the World Bank.
In areas that are still ripped by conflict, of course development will not be easy.
Peace will be necessary for final success.
But we cannot and must not wait for peace to begin this job.
This will be a disorderly planet for a long time.
In Asia, as elsewhere, the forces of the modern world are shaking old ways and uprooting ancient civilizations.
There will be turbulence and struggle and even violence.
Great social changeas we see in our own country nowdoes not always come without conflict.
We must also expect that nations will on occasion be in dispute with us.
It may be because we are rich, or powerful; or because we have made some mistakes; or because they honestly fear our intentions.
However, no nation need ever fear that we desire their land, or to impose our will, or to dictate their institutions.
But we will always oppose the effort of one nation to conquer another nation.
We will do this because our own security is at stake.
But there is more to it than that.
For our generation has a dream.
It is a very old dream.
But we have the power and now we have the opportunity to make that dream come true.
For centuries nations have struggled among each other.
But we dream of a world where disputes are settled by law and reason.
And we will try to make it so.
For most of history men have hated and killed one another in battle.
But we dream of an end to war.
And we will try to make it so.
For all existence most men have lived in poverty, threatened by hunger.
But we dream of a world where all are fed and charged with hope.
And we will help to make it so.
The ordinary men and women of North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Namof China and Indiaof Russia and Americaare brave people.
They are filled with the same proportions of hate and fear, of love and hope.
Most of them want the same things for themselves and their families.
Most of them do not want their sons to ever die in battle, or to see their homes, or the homes of others, destroyed.
Well, this can be their world yet.
Man now has the knowledgealways before deniedto make this planet serve the real needs of the people who live on it.
I know this will not be easy.
I know how difficult it is for reason to guide passion, and love to master hate.
The complexities of this world do not bow easily to pure and consistent answers.
But the simple truths are there just the same.
We must all try to follow them as best we can.
We often say how impressive power is.
But I do not find it impressive at all.
The guns and the bombs, the rockets and the warships, are all symbols of human failure.
They are necessary symbols.
They protect what we cherish.
But they are witness to human folly.
A dam built across a great river is impressive.
In the countryside where I was born, and where I live, I have seen the night illuminated, and the kitchens warmed, and the homes heated, where once the cheerless night and the ceaseless cold held sway.
And all this happened because electricity came to our area along the humming wires of the REA Electrification of the countrysideyes, that, too, is impressive.
A rich harvest in a hungry land is impressive.
The sight of healthy children in a classroom is impressive.
Thesenot mighty armsare the achievements which the American Nation believes to be impressive.
And, if we are steadfast, the time may come when all other nations will also find it so.
Every night before I turn out the lights to sleep I ask myself this question: Have I done everything that I can do to unite this country? Have I done everything I can to help unite the world, to try to bring peace and hope to all the peoples of the world? Have I done enough?Ask yourselves that question in your homesand in this hall tonight.
Have we, each of us, all done all we could? Have we done enough?We may well be living in the time foretold many years ago when it was said: I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.
This generation of the world must choose: destroy or build, kill or aid, hate or understand.
We can do all these things on a scale never dreamed of before.
Well, we will choose life.
In so doing we will prevail over the enemies within man, and over the natural enemies of all mankind.
To  Eisenhower and  Garland, and this great institution, Johns Hopkins, I thank you for this opportunity to convey my thoughts to you and to the American people.
Good night.
Garland, Senator Brewster, Senator Tydings, Members of the congressional delegation, members of the faculty of Johns Hopkins, student body, my fellow Americans:Last week, 17 nations sent their views to some two dozen countries having an interest in southeast Asia.
We are joining those 17 countries and stating our American policy tonight which we believe will contribute toward peace in this area of the world.
I have come here to review once again with my own people the views of the American Government.
Tonight Americans and Asians are dying for a world where each people may choose its own path to change.
This is the principle for which our ancestors fought in the valleys of Pennsylvania.
It is the principle for which our sons fight tonight in the jungles of Viet-Nam.
Viet-Nam is far away from this quiet campus.
We have no territory there, nor do we seek any.
The war is dirty and brutal and difficult.
And some 400 young men, born into an America that is bursting with opportunity and promise, have ended their lives on Viet-Nam's steaming soil.
Why must we take this painful road?Why must this Nation hazard its ease, and its interest, and its power for the sake of a people so far away?We fight because we must fight if we are to live in a world where every country can shape its own destiny.
And only in such a world will our own freedom be finally secure.
This kind of world will never be built by bombs or bullets.
Yet the infirmities of man are such that force must often precede reason, and the waste of war, the works of peace.
We wish that this were not so.
But we must deal with the world as it is, if it is ever to be as we wish.
The world as it is in Asia is not a serene or peaceful place.
The first reality is that North Viet-Nam has attacked the independent nation of South Viet-Nam.
Its object is total conquest.
Of course, some of the people of South Viet-Nam are participating in attack on their own government.
But trained men and supplies, orders and arms, flow in a constant stream from north to south.
This support is the heartbeat of the war.
And it is a war of unparalleled brutality.
Simple farmers are the targets of assassination and kidnapping.
Women and children are strangled in the night because their men are loyal to their government.
And helpless villages are ravaged by sneak attacks.
Large-scale raids are conducted on towns, and terror strikes in the heart of cities.
The confused nature of this conflict cannot mask the fact that it is the new face of an old enemy.
Over this warand all Asiais another reality: the deepening shadow of Communist China.
The rulers in Hanoi are urged on by Peking.
This is a regime which has destroyed freedom in Tibet, which has attacked India, and has been condemned by the United Nations for aggression in Korea.
It is a nation which is helping the forces of violence in almost every continent.
The contest in Viet-Nam is part of a wider pattern of aggressive purposes.
Why are these realities our concern? Why are we in South Viet-Nam ?We are there because we have a promise to keep.
Since 1954, every American President has offered support to the people of South Viet-Nam.
We have helped to build, and we have helped to defend.
Thus, over many years, we have made a national pledge to he!p South Viet-Nam defend its independence.
And I intend to keep that promise.
To dishonor that pledge, to abandon this small and brave nation to its enemies, and to the terror that must follow, would be an unforgivable wrong.
We are also there to strengthen world order.
Around the globe, from Berlin to Thailand, are people whose well-being rests, in part, on the belief that they can count on us if they are attacked.
To leave Viet-Nam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of an American commitment and in the value of America's word.
The result would be increased unrest and instability, and even wider war.
We are also there because there are great stakes in the balance.
Let no one think for a moment that retreat from Viet-Nam would bring an end to conflict.
The battle would be renewed in one country and then another.
The central lesson of our time is that the appetite of aggression is never satisfied.
To withdraw from one battlefield means only to prepare for the next.
We must say in southeast Asiaas we did in Europein the words of the Bible: Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further.
There are those who say that all our effort there will be futilethat China's power is such that it is bound to dominate all southeast Asia.
But there is no end to that argument until all of the nations of Asia are swallowed up.
There are those who wonder why we have a responsibility there.
Well, we have it there for the same reason that we have a responsibility for the defense of Europe.
World War II was fought in both Europe and Asia, and when it ended we found ourselves with continued responsibility for the defense of freedom.
Our objective is the independence of South Viet-Nam, and its freedom from attack.
We want nothing for ourselvesonly that the people of South Viet-Nam be allowed to guide their own country in their own way.
We will do everything necessary to reach that objective.
And we will do only what is absolutely necessary.
In recent months attacks on South Viet-Nam were stepped up.
Thus, it became necessary for us to increase our response and to make attacks by air.
This is not a change of purpose.
It is a change in what we believe that purpose requires.
We do this in order to slow down aggression.
We do this to increase the confidence of the brave people of South Viet-Nam who have bravely borne this brutal battle for so many years with so many casualties.
And we do this to convince the leaders of North Viet-Namand all who seek to share their conquestof a very simple fact: We will not be defeated.
We will not grow tired.
We will not withdraw, either openly or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement.
We know that air attacks alone will not accomplish all of these purposes.
But it is our best and prayerful judgment that they are a necessary part of the surest road to peace.
We hope that peace will come swiftly.
But that is in the hands of others besides ourselves.
And we must be prepared for a long continued conflict.
It will require patience as well as bravery, the will to endure as well as the will to resist.
I wish it were possible to convince others with words of what we now find it necessary to say with guns and planes: Armed hostility is futile.
Our resources are equal to any challenge.
Because we fight for values and we fight for principles, rather than territory or colonies, our patience and our determination are unending.
Once this is clear, then it should also be clear that the only path for reasonable men is the path of peaceful settlement.
Such peace demands an independent South Viet-Namsecurely guaranteed and able to shape its own relationships to all others-free from outside interferencetied to no alliancea military base for no other country.
These are the essentials of any final settlement.
We will never be second in the search for such a peaceful settlement in Viet-Nam.
There may be many ways to this kind of peace: in discussion or negotiation with the governments concerned; in large groups or in small ones; in the reaffirmation of old agreements or their strengthening with new ones.
We have stated this position over and over again, fifty times and more, to friend and foe alike.
And we remain ready, with this purpose, for unconditional discussions.
And until that bright and necessary day of peace we will try to keep conflict from spreading.
We have no desire to see thousands die in battleAsians or Americans.
We have no desire to devastate that which the people of North Viet-Nam have built with toil and sacrifice.
We will use our power with restraint and with all the wisdom that we can command.
But we will use it.
This war, like most wars, is filled with terrible irony.
For what do the people of North Viet-Nam want? They want what their neighbors also desire: food for their hunger; health for their bodies; a chance to learn; progress for their country; and an end to the bondage of material misery.
And they would find all these things far more readily in peaceful association with others than in the endless course of battle.
These countries of southeast Asia are homes for millions of impoverished people.
Each day these people rise at dawn and struggle through until the night to wrestle existence from the soil.
They are often wracked by disease, plagued by hunger, and death comes at the early age of 40.
Stability and peace do not come easily in such a land.
Neither independence nor human dignity will ever be won, though, by arms alone.
It also requires the work of peace.
The American people have helped generously in times past in these works.
Now there must be a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict-torn corner of our world.
The first step is for the countries of southeast Asia to associate themselves in a greatly expanded cooperative effort for development.
We would hope that North Viet-Nam would take its place in the common effort just as soon as peaceful cooperation is possible.
The United Nations is already actively engaged in development in this area.
As far back as 1961 I conferred with our authorities in Viet-Nam in connection with their work there.
And I would hope tonight that the Secretary General of the United Nations could use the prestige of his great office, and his deep knowledge of Asia, to initiate, as soon as possible, with the countries of that area, a plan for cooperation in increased development.
For our part I will ask the Congress to join in a billion dollar American investment in this effort as soon as it is underway.
And I would hope that all other industrialized countries, including the Soviet Union, will join in this effort to replace despair with hope, and terror with progress.
The task is nothing less than to enrich the hopes and the existence of more than a hundred million people.
And there is much to be done.
The vast Mekong River can provide food and water and power on a scale to dwarf even our own TVAThe wonders of modern medicine can be spread through villages where thousands die every year from lack of care.
Schools can be established to train people in the skills that are needed to manage the process of development.
And these objectives, and more, are within the reach of a cooperative and determined effort.
I also intend to expand and speed up a program to make available our farm surpluses to assist in feeding and clothing the needy in Asia.
We should not allow people to go hungry and wear rags while our own warehouses overflow with an abundance of wheat and corn, rice and cotton.
So I will very shortly name a special team of outstanding, patriotic, distinguished Americans to inaugurate our participation in these programs.
This team will be headed by  Eugene Black, the very able former President of the World Bank.
In areas that are still ripped by conflict, of course development will not be easy.
Peace will be necessary for final success.
But we cannot and must not wait for peace to begin this job.
This will be a disorderly planet for a long time.
In Asia, as elsewhere, the forces of the modern world are shaking old ways and uprooting ancient civilizations.
There will be turbulence and struggle and even violence.
Great social changeas we see in our own country nowdoes not always come without conflict.
We must also expect that nations will on occasion be in dispute with us.
It may be because we are rich, or powerful; or because we have made some mistakes; or because they honestly fear our intentions.
However, no nation need ever fear that we desire their land, or to impose our will, or to dictate their institutions.
But we will always oppose the effort of one nation to conquer another nation.
We will do this because our own security is at stake.
But there is more to it than that.
For our generation has a dream.
It is a very old dream.
But we have the power and now we have the opportunity to make that dream come true.
For centuries nations have struggled among each other.
But we dream of a world where disputes are settled by law and reason.
And we will try to make it so.
For most of history men have hated and killed one another in battle.
But we dream of an end to war.
And we will try to make it so.
For all existence most men have lived in poverty, threatened by hunger.
But we dream of a world where all are fed and charged with hope.
And we will help to make it so.
The ordinary men and women of North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Namof China and Indiaof Russia and Americaare brave people.
They are filled with the same proportions of hate and fear, of love and hope.
Most of them want the same things for themselves and their families.
Most of them do not want their sons to ever die in battle, or to see their homes, or the homes of others, destroyed.
Well, this can be their world yet.
Man now has the knowledgealways before deniedto make this planet serve the real needs of the people who live on it.
I know this will not be easy.
I know how difficult it is for reason to guide passion, and love to master hate.
The complexities of this world do not bow easily to pure and consistent answers.
But the simple truths are there just the same.
We must all try to follow them as best we can.
We often say how impressive power is.
But I do not find it impressive at all.
The guns and the bombs, the rockets and the warships, are all symbols of human failure.
They are necessary symbols.
They protect what we cherish.
But they are witness to human folly.
A dam built across a great river is impressive.

To  Eisenhower and  Garland, and this great institution, Johns Hopkins, I thank you for this opportunity to convey my thoughts to you and to the American people.
Good night.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am glad to see that you are willing to trade your new comfort in the West Lobby for these straight-backed chairs in the East Room.
Today I have somewhat of a conflict of emotions.
I wanted to give you due and adequate 3-day notice of a press conference, and at the same time I did not want to manage the news by holding up the announcement of some appointees I have here today, so we have tried to reconcile the two, and a little later in the statement I want to present to you some men that over the weekend I selected to occupy some important posts in Government.
We are engaged in a crucial struggle in Viet-Nam.
Some may consider it a small war, but to the men who give their lives it is the last war and the stakes are high.
Independent South Viet-Nam has been attacked by North Viet-Nam.
The object of that attack is total conquest.
Defeat in South Viet-Nam would deliver a friendly nation to terror and repression.
It would encourage and spur on those who seek to conquer all free nations that are within their reach.
Our own welfare, our own freedom, would be in great danger.
This is the clearest lesson of our time.
From Munich until today we have learned that to yield to aggression brings only greater threats and brings even more destructive war.
To stand firm is the only guarantee of a lasting peace.
At every step of the way, we have used our great power with the utmost restraint.
We have made every effort possible to find a peaceful solution.
We have done this in the face of the most outrageous and brutal provocation against Vietnamese and against Americans alike.
Through the first 7 months of 1964, both Vietnamese and Americans were the targets of constant attacks of terror.
Bombs exploded in helpless villages, in downtown movie theaters, even at the sports fields where the children played.
Soldiers and civilians, men and women, were murdered and crippled, yet we took no action against the source of this brutalityNorth Viet-Nam.
When our destroyers were attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin, as you will remember last summer, we replied promptly with a single raid.
The punishment then was limited to the deed.
For the next 6 months we took no action against North Viet-Nam.
We warned of danger; we hoped for caution in others.
Their answer was attack, and explosions, and indiscriminate murder.
So it soon became clear that our restraint was viewed as weakness; our desire to limit conflict was viewed as a prelude to our surrender.
We could no longer stand by while attacks mounted and while the bases of the attackers were immune from reply.
Therefore, we began to strike back.
But America has not changed her essential position, and that purpose is peaceful settlement.
That purpose is to resist aggression.
That purpose is to avoid a wider war.
I say again that I will talk to any government, anywhere, any time, without any conditions, and if any doubt our sincerity, let them test us.
Each time we have met with silence, or slander, or the sound of guns.
But just as we will not flag in battle, we will not weary in the search for peace.
So I reaffirm my offer of unconditional discussions.
We will discuss any subject and any point of view with any government concerned.
This offer may be rejected, as it has been in the past, but it will remain open, waiting for the day when it becomes clear to all that armed attack will not yield domination over others.
And I will continue along the course that we have set: firmness with moderation; readiness for peace with refusal to retreat.
For this is the same battle which we fought for a generation.
Wherever we have stood firm, aggression has been halted, peace has been restored, and liberty has been maintained.
This was true under President Truman, under President Eisenhower, under President Kennedy, and it will be true again in southeast Asia.
I want to go now to another subject.
I want to congratulate the negotiators for the steel companies and the United Steelworkers union on the statesmanlike agreement that they reached yesterday to extend their contract.
I hope and I expect that it will be approved by the union's committee tomorrow.
While the settlement reached in steel is only an interim one, I think we can be confident that the final settlement will be a responsible one which fully considers not only the interest of the immediate parties, but also the larger public interest.
So far in 1965 our record of wage-price stability remains intact.
A survey of the wage increases on more than 600 collective bargainings settled so far this year shows that on the average the percentage increases were unchanged from the moderate increases agreed on in the same period last year.
A number of important settlements were at approximately the level of our guideposts, and this record of private actions is most encouraging.
Today I can report to you and to the Nation that our expanding economy will produce higher Federal revenues this year than we estimated to Congress in January.
I can also report that our continuing drive to hold down Government spending will produce lower expenditures this year than we estimated to Congress in January.
As a result, we expect the actual budget deficit for fiscal 1965 to be at least $1 billion below the $6,300 million estimated last January when we sent our budget to Congress.
Our expenditures, therefore, will be decreased by approximately $500 million under our estimate, and the revenues collected will be increased by approximately $500 million over our estimates.
I am pleased also to announce today that the war on poverty is setting up 10 new Job Corps conservation camps in nine States.
They will bring to 87 the number of centers that provide skills and education to our youngsters who are out of school and out of work.
These new centers will be located in the States of Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, and Washington.
Today I would like to introduce to you some gentlemen that I intend to nominate for new assignments in this administration.

We are all very much concerned about the serious situation which has developed in the last few hours in the Dominican Republic.
Fighting has occurred among different elements of the Dominican armed forces and other groups.
Public order in the capital at Santo Domingo has broken down.
Due to the gravity of the situation, and the possible danger to the lives of American citizens in the Dominican Republic, I ordered the evacuation of those who wish to leave.
As you know, the evacuation is now proceeding.
My latest information is that 1,000 Americans have already been taken aboard ships of the U.
S.
Navy off the port of Haina, 8 miles west of Santo Domingo.
We profoundly deplore the violence and disorder in the Dominican Republic.
The situation is grave, and we are following the developments very closely.
It is our hope that order can promptly be restored, and that a peaceful settlement of the internal problems can be found.
I have just received the sad news of the passing of Edward R.
Murrow.
It came to me just a little while ago.
I believe that all of us feel a deep sense of loss.
We who knew him knew that he was a gallant fighter, a man who dedicated his life both as a newsman and as a public official to an unrelenting search for truth.
He subscribed to the proposition that free men and free inquiry are inseparable.
He built his life on that unbreakable truth.
We have all lost a friend.
I will be glad to take any questions now.
I do not believe in characterizing people with labels.
I think you do a great disservice when you engage in name calling.
We want honest, forthright discussion in this country, and that will be discussion with differences of views, and we welcome what our friends have to say, whether they agree with us or not.
I would not want to label people who agree with me or disagree with me.
We deplore fighting wherever it takes place.
We have been in dose touch with the situation there.
We are very hopeful that ways and means can be found to avoid conflict between these two friends of our country.
I talked to Secretary Rusk about it within the hour, and we are anxious to do anything and everything that we can do to see that peace is restored in that area and conflict is ended.
I have not studied the proposal and was not familiar with the fact that it had been made.
I think it was very evident from the Baltimore speech that most of the non-Communist countries in the world welcomed the proposal in that speech, and most of the Communist countries found objections with it.
I am very hopeful that some ways and means can be found to bring the parties who are interested in southeast Asia to a conference table.
Just what those ways and means will be, I do not know.
But every day we explore to the limit of our capacity every possible political and diplomatic move that would bring that about.
We have read their statements from time to time, and the statements of other powers about what they propose 2 Item 172.
to do.
We are in close touch with the situation.
That is all I think I would like to say on that matter.
Yes.
I think there has been unjust criticism and unfair criticism and uninformed criticism of the poverty program even before Congress passed it.
Some people opposed it every step of the way.
Some people oppose it now.
I do not know of any national program in peacetime that has reached so many people so fast and so effectively.
Over 16,000 Americans have already volunteered to live and work with the Peace Corps domestically.
A quarter of a million young men have joined the Job Corps.
Every major city has developed poverty plans and made application for funds.
Three hundred State, city, and county community action programs have already received their money.
Forty-five thousand students from needy families are already enrolled in 800 colleges under the work program.
More than 125,000 adults are trainees in adult education on the work-experience program.
We will have difficulties.
We will have politicians attempting to get some jobs in the local level.
We will have these differences as we do in all of our programs, but I have great confidence in Sargent Shriver as an administrator and as a man, and I have great confidence in the wisdom the Congress displayed in passing the poverty program.
I think it will be one of the great monuments to this administration.
I think that we have friends throughout the world.
I am not concerned with any friends that we have lost.
Following my Baltimore speech, I received from our allies almost a universal approval.
Our enemies would have you believe that we are following policies that are ill-advised, but we are following the same policies in Asia that we followed in Europe, that we followed in Turkey and Greece and Iran.
We are resisting aggression, and as long as the aggressors attack, we will stay there and resist themwhether we make friends or lose friends.
I think that is being worked out in the conferences they are having today, and they will have in the next few weeks.
I have always opposed the poll tax.
I am opposed to it now.
I have been advised by constitutional lawyers that we have a problem in repealing the poll tax by statute.
For that reason, while a Member of Congress, I initiated and supported a constitutional amendment to repeal the poll tax in Federal elections.
I think the bill as now drawn will not permit the poll tax to be used to discriminate against voters, and I think the administration will have adequate authority to prevent its use for that purpose.
I have asked the Attorney General, however, to meet with the various Members of the House and Senate who are interested in this phase of it, and if possible, take every step that he can within constitutional bounds to see that the poll tax is not used as a discrimination against any voter anywhere.
I said in my opening statement that we went for months without destroying a bridge, or an ammunition depot, or a radar station.
Those military targets have been the primary targets that we have attacked.
There is no blood in a bridge made of concrete and steel, but we do try to take it out so that people cannot furnish additional troops and additional equipment to kill the people of South Viet-Nam, and to kill our own soldiers.
There are not many civilians involved in a radar station, but we do try to make it ineffective so that they cannot plot our planes and shoot our boys out of the skies.
There are not many individuals involved in an ammunition dump, but we have tried to destroy that ammunition so that it would be exploded in North Viet-Nam and not in the bodies of the people of South Viet-Nam or our American soldiers.
We have said time and time again that we regret the necessity of doing this, but as long as aggression continues, as long as they bomb in South Viet-Nam, as long as they bomb our sports arenas, and our theaters, and our embassies, and kill our women and our children and the Vietnamese soldiers, several thousand of whom have been killed since the first of the year, we think that we are justified in trying to slow down that operation and make them realize that it is very costly, and that their aggression should cease.
I do sometimes wonder how some people can be so concerned with our bombing a cold bridge of steel and concrete in North Viet-Nam, but never open their mouths about a bomb being placed in our embassy in South Viet-Nam.
The moment that this aggression ceases, the destruction of their bridges and their radar stations and the ammunition that they use on our bodies will cease.
First of all, I would not assume many parts of your statement.
First, we did not cancel it.
So that is the first error that the critics have made.
We feel very friendly toward the people of India and the Government of India; toward the people of Pakistan and the Government of Pakistan.
I have spent some time in both of those countries.
I have had the leaders of those countries visit me in this country and visit in my home.
I have before the Congress now recommendations concerning the peoples of those countries and how we can work together to try to achieve peace in the world.
I said through the appropriate channels to those governments that I had had some eight or nine visitors already the first 90 days of this administration; that the Congress was hopeful that it would get out of here in early summer; that we had approximately 75 top important measures that we were trying to get considered and passed, one of which vitally affected that part of the world; and that I could be much more communicative and could respond much more to their suggestions and to their recommendations on the future of India and their 5-year plan, and Pakistan and their plan, if our visit could follow the enactment of some of these bills instead of preceding them, because if it preceded them, I could not speak with authority.
I would not know what the Congress would do.
We have spent in excess of $10 billion in that area, and this year we will propose expenditures of more than $1 billion.
But if the Congress said no to me and did not pass the foreign aid bill or materially reduced it, I would have made a commitment that I could not support, so I said, If you would like to come now in the month of May or June, during this period, we can have a visit, but we will not be able to be as responsive as I would like to be if you could come a little later in the year.
I have been host a few times in my life and when you put things that way, most people want to come at the time that would be most convenient to us, to the host, and would be most helpful to them.
We communicated that to the appropriate people, and the answer came back that they would accept that decision.
I think it was a good decision in our interest and I think it was a good decision in their interest.
I am very sorry that our people have made a good deal of it, but the provocation of the differences sometimes comes about, and I regret it.
So far as I know, it is a good decision, and a wise one, and one that I would make again tomorrow.
Well, first of all, I have the responsibility for decision on nuclear weapons.
That rests with the President.
It is the most serious responsibility that rests with him.
Secretary McNamara very carefully and very clearly in his television appearance yesterday covered that subject thoroughly, and I think adequately.
There is not anything that I could really add to what he said.
I would observe this: that I have been President for 17 months, and I have sat many hours and weeks with the officials of this Government in trying to plan for the protection and security of our people.
I have never had a suggestion from a single official of this Government or employee of this Government concerning the use of such weapons in this area.
The only person that has ever mentioned it to me has been a newspaperman writing a story, and each time I tell them, Please get it out of your system.
Please forget it.
There is just not anything to it.
No one has discussed it with us at all.
I think that when Secretary McNamara told you of the requirement yesterday and that no useful purpose was served by going into it further, I thought it had ended there.
I would not know.
I frequently see statements they make that we never heard of.
I do not know about the particular report that you mentioned.
Our purpose in Viet-Nam is, as you well know, to advise and to assist those people in resisting aggression.
We are performing that duty there now.
I would not be able to anticipate or to speculate on the conduct of each individual in the days ahead.
I think that if the enemy there believes that we are there to stay, that we are not going to tuck our tails and run home and abandon our friends, I believe in due time peace can be observed in that area.
My objective is to contribute what we can to assist the people of South Viet-Nam who have lost thousands of lives defending their country, and to provide the maximum amount of deterrent with the minimum cost.
They have lost thousands of people since February.
We have lost some 40 to 50 people of our own.
We could not anticipate in February whether we would lose 50 or whether we would lose 500.
That depends on the fortunes and the problems of conflict.
But I can assure you that we are being very carefulthat we are being very studiousthat we are being very deliberatethat we are trying to do everything we can within reason to convince these people that they should not attack, that they should not be aggressors, that they should not try to swallow up their neighbor, and we are doing it with the minimum amount of expenditures of lives that we can spend.
I do not want to pass on it.
We have laid down the guideposts.
They are well acquainted with themboth management and employees.
They have had very responsible negotiations, and we are very pleased with the outcome of those negotiations.
We anticipate that they will be confirmed by both parties very shortly, and we believe between now and the September deadline that we will have an agreement.
I do not think that I have ever observed a period in the life of free enterprise in this country when American labor and American business have been more responsible, and have been more anxious to work with their Government in maintaining full productivity, and I expect that that will come about.
Thank you,  President.
I have just concluded a meeting with the leaders of the Congress.
I reported to them on the serious situation in the Dominican Republic.
I reported the decisions that this Government considers necessary in this situation in order to protect American lives.
The members of the leadership expressed their support of these decisions.
The United States Government has been informed by military authorities in the Dominican Republic that American lives are in danger.
These authorities are no longer able to guarantee their safety and they have reported that the assistance of military personnel is now needed for that purpose.
I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to put the necessary American troops ashore in order to give protection to hundreds of Americans who are still in the Dominican Republic and to escort them safely back to this country.
This same assistance will be available to the nationals of other countries, some of whom have already asked for our help.
Pursuant to my instructions 400 Marines have already landed.
General Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has just reported to me that there have been no incidents.
We have appealed repeatedly in recent days for a cease-fire between the contending forces of the Dominican Republic in the interests of all Dominicans and foreigners alike.
I repeat this urgent appeal again tonight.
The Council of the OAS has been advised of the situation by the Dominican Ambassador and the Council will be kept fully informed.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen:I have just come from a meeting with the leaders of both parties in the Congress which was held in the Cabinet Room in the White House.
I briefed them on the facts of the situation in the Dominican Republic.
I want to make those same facts known to all the American people and to all the world.
There are times in the affairs of nations when great principles are tested in an ordeal of conflict and danger.
This is such a time for the American nations.
At stake are the lives of thousands, the liberty of a nation, and the principles and the values of all the American Republics.
That is why the hopes and the concern of this entire hemisphere are, on this Sabbath-Sunday, focused on the Dominican Republic.
In the dark mist of conflict and violence, revolution and confusion, it is not easy to find clear and unclouded truths.
But certain things are clear.
And they require equally clear action.
To understand, I think it is necessary to begin with the events of 8 or 9 days ago.
Last week our observers warned of an approaching political storm in the Dominican Republic.
I immediately asked our Ambassador to return to Washington at once so that we might discuss the situation and might plan a course of conduct.
But events soon outran our hopes for peace.
Saturday, April 24th  8 days ago  while Ambassador Bennett was conferring with the highest officials of your Government, revolution erupted in the Dominican Republic.
Elements of the military forces of that country overthrew their government.
However, the rebels themselves were divided.
Some wanted to restore former President Juan Bosch.
Others opposed his restoration.
President Bosch, elected after the fall of Trujillo and his assassination, had been driven from office by an earlier revolution in the Dominican Republic.
Those who opposed  Bosch's return formed a military committee in an effort to control that country.
The others took to the street and they began to lead a revolt on behalf of President Bosch.
Control and effective government dissolved in conflict and confusion.
Meanwhile the United States was making a constant effort to restore peace.
From Saturday afternoon onward, our embassy urged a cease-fire, and I and all the officials of the American Government worked with every weapon at our command to achieve it.
On Tuesday the situation of turmoil was presented to the peace committee of the Organization of American States.
On Wednesday the entire Council of the Organization of American States received a full report from the Dominican Ambassador.
Meanwhile, all this time, from Saturday to Wednesday, the danger was mounting.
Even though we were deeply saddened by bloodshed and violence in a close and friendly neighbor, we had no desire to interfere in the affairs of a sister republic.
On Wednesday afternoon, there was no longer any choice for the man who is your President.
I was sitting in my little office reviewing the world situation with Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, and  McGeorge Bundy.
Shortly after 3 of the clock I received a cable from our Ambassador and he said that things were in danger, he had been informed that the chief of police and the governmental authorities could no longer protect us.
We immediately started the necessary conference calls to be prepared.
At 5:14, almost 2 hours later, we received a cable that was labeled critic, a word that is reserved for only the most urgent and immediate matters of national security.
The cable reported that Dominican law enforcement and military officials had informed our embassy that the situation was completely out of control and that the police and the Government could no longer give any guarantee concerning the safety of Americans or of any foreign nationals.
Ambassador Bennett, who is one of our most experienced Foreign Service officers, went on in that cable to say that only an immediate landing of American forces could safeguard and protect the lives of thousands of Americans and thousands of other citizens of some 30 other countries.
Ambassador Bennett urged your President to order an immediate landing.
In this situation hesitation and vacillation could mean death for many of our people, as well as many of the citizens of other lands.
I thought that we could not and we did not hesitate.
Our forces, American forces, were ordered in immediately to protect American lives.
They have done that.
They have attacked no one, and although some of our servicemen gave their lives, not a single American civilian and the civilian of any other nation, as a result of this protection, lost their lives.
There may be those in our own country who say that such action was good but we should have waited, or we should have delayed, or we should have consulted further, or we should have called a meeting.
But from the very beginning, the United States, at my instructions, had worked for a cease-fire beginning the Saturday the revolution took place.
The matter was before the OAS peace committee on Tuesday, at our suggestion.
It was before the full Council on Wednesday and when I made my announcement to the American people that evening, I announced then that I was notifying the Council.
When that cable arrived, when our entire country team in the Dominican Republic, made up of nine men  one from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, our Ambassador, our AID man and others  said to your President unanimously:  President, if you do not send forces immediately, men and women  Americans and those of other lands  will die in the streets  well, I knew there was no time to talk, to consult, or to delay.
For in this situation delay itself would be decision  the decision to risk and to lose the lives of thousands of Americans and thousands of innocent people from all lands.
I want you to know that it is not a light or an easy matter to send our American boys to another country, but I do not think that the American people expect their President to hesitate or to vacillate in the face of danger just because the decision is hard when life is in peril.
Meanwhile, the revolutionary movement took a tragic turn.
Communist leaders, many of them trained in Cuba, seeing a chance to increase disorder, to gain a foothold, joined the revolution.
They took increasing control.
And what began as a popular democratic revolution, committed to democracy and social justice, very shortly moved and was taken over and really seized and placed into the hands of a band of Communist conspirators.
Many of the original leaders of the rebellion, the followers of President Bosch, took refuge in foreign embassies because they had been superseded by other evil forces, and the Secretary General of the rebel government, Martinez Francisco, appealed for a cease-fire.
But he was ignored.
The revolution was now in other and dangerous hands.
When these new and ominous developments emerged, the OAS met again and it met at the request of the United States.
I am glad to say that they responded wisely and decisively.
A five-nation OAS team is now in the Dominican Republic acting to achieve a cease-fire to ensure the safety of innocent people, to restore normal conditions, and to open a path to democratic process.
That is the situation now.
I plead, therefore, with every person and every country in this hemisphere that would choose to do so, to contact their ambassador and the Dominican Republic directly and to get firsthand evidence of the horrors and the hardship, the violence and the terror, and the international conspiracy from which U.
S.
servicemen have rescued the people of more than 30 nations from that war-torn island.
Earlier today I ordered two additional battalions  2,000 extra men  to proceed immediately to the Dominican Republic.
In the meeting that I just concluded with the congressional leaders following that meeting I directed the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to issue instructions to land an additional 4,500 men at the earliest possible moment.
The distribution of food to people who have not eaten for days, the need of medical supplies and attention for the sick and wounded, the health requirements to avoid an epidemic because there are hundreds that have been dead for days that are now in the streets, and that further protection of the security of each individual that is caught on that island require the attention of the additional forces which I have ordered to proceed to the Dominican Republic.
In addition, our servicemen have already, since they landed on Wednesday night, evacuated 3,000 persons from 30 countries in the world from this little island.
But more than 5,000 people, 1,500 of whom are Americans  the others are foreign nationals  are tonight awaiting evacuation as I speak.
We just must get on with that job immediately.
The American nations cannot, must not, and will not permit the establishment of another Communist government in the Western Hemisphere.
This was the unanimous view of all the American nations when, in January 1962, they declared, and I quote: The principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of the inter-American system.
This is what our beloved President John F.
Kennedy meant when, less than a week before his death, he told us: We in this hemisphere must also use every resource at our command to prevent the establishment of another Cuba in this hemisphere.
This is and this will be the common action and the common purpose of the democratic forces of the hemisphere.
For the danger is also a common danger, and the principles are common principles.
So we have acted to summon the resources of this entire hemisphere to this task.
We have sent, on my instructions night before last, special emissaries such as Ambassador Moscoso of Puerto Rico, our very able Ambassador Averell Harriman, and others to Latin America to explain the situation, to tell them the truth, and to warn them that joint action is necessary.
We are in contact with such distinguished Latin American statesmen as Romulo Betancourt and Jose Figueres.
We are seeking their wisdom and their counsel and their advice.
We have also maintained communication with President Bosch, who has chosen to remain in Puerto Rico.
We have been consulting with the Organization of American States, and our distinguished Ambassador, than whom there is no better  Ambassador Bunker  has been reporting to them at great length all the actions of this Government and we have been acting in conformity with their decisions.
We know that many who are now in revolt do not seek a Communist tyranny.
We think it is tragic indeed that their high motives have been misused by a small band of conspirators who receive their directions from abroad.
To those who fight only for liberty and justice and progress I want to join with the Organization of American States in saying, in appealing to you tonight, to lay down your arms, and to assure you there is nothing to fear.
The road is open for you to share in building a Dominican democracy and we in America are ready and anxious and willing to help you.
Your courage and your dedication are qualities which your country and all the hemisphere need for the future.
You are needed to help shape that future.
And neither we nor any other nation in this hemisphere can or should take it upon itself to ever interfere with the affairs of your country or any other country.
We believe that change comes and we are glad it does, and it should come through peaceful process.
But revolution in any country is a matter for that country to deal with.
It becomes a matter calling for hemispheric action only  repeat  only when the object is the establishment of a communistic dictatorship.
Let me also make clear tonight that we support no single man or any single group of men in the Dominican Republic.
Our goal is a simple one.
We are there to save the lives of our citizens and to save the lives of all people.
Our goal, in keeping with the great principles of the inter-American system, is to help prevent another Communist state in this hemisphere.
And we would like to do this without bloodshed or without large-scale fighting.
The form and the nature of a free Dominican government, I assure you, is solely a matter for the Dominican people, but we do know what kind of government we hope to see in the Dominican Republic.
For that is carefully spelled out in the treaties and the agreements which make up the fabric of the entire inter-American system.
It is expressed, time and time again, in the words of our statesmen and in the values and hopes which bind us all together.
We hope to see a government freely chosen by the will of all the people.
We hope to see a government dedicated to social justice for every single citizen.
We hope to see a government working, every hour of every day, to feeding the hungry, to educating the ignorant, to healing the sick  a government whose only concern is the progress and the elevation and the welfare of all the people.
For more than 3 decades the people of that tragic little island suffered under the weight of one of the most brutal and despotic dictatorships in the history of the Americas.
We enthusiastically supported condemnation of that government by the Organization of American States.
We joined in applying sanctions and when Trujillo was assassinated by his fellow citizens we immediately acted to protect freedom and to prevent a new tyranny.
And since that time we have taken the resources from all of our people, at some sacrifice to many, and we have helped them with food and with other resources, with the Peace Corps volunteers, with the AID technicians.
We have helped them in the effort to build a new order of progress.
How sad it is tonight that a people so long oppressed should once again be the targets of the forces of tyranny.
Their long misery must weigh heavily on the heart of every citizen of this hemisphere.
So I think it is our mutual responsibility to help the people of the Dominican Republic toward the day when they can freely choose the path of liberty and justice and progress.
This is required of us by the agreements that we are party to and that we have signed.
This is required of us by the values which bind us together.
Simon Bolivar once wrote from exile: The veil has been torn asunder.
We have already seen the light and it is not our desire to be thrust back into the darkness.
Well, after decades of night the Dominican people have seen a more hopeful light and I know that the nations of this hemisphere will not let them be thrust back into the darkness.
And before I leave you, my fellow Americans, I want to say this personal word: I know that no American serviceman wants to kill anyone.
I know that no American President wants to give an order which brings shooting and casualties and death.
I want you to know and I want the world to know that as long as I am President of this country, we are going to defend ourselves.
We will defend our soldiers against attackers.
We will honor our treaties.
We will keep our commitments.
We will defend our Nation against all those who seek to destroy not only the United States but every free country of this hemisphere.
We do not want to bury anyone as I have said so many times before.
But we do not intend to be buried.
Thank you.
God bless you.
Good night.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and my friends of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists: I am very happy that you requested through the press office this opportunity for us to meet together, because after looking at some of the cartoons you have drawn, I thought I had invite you over to see me in person.
After all, I had nothing to lose.
I know that I am talking to the most influential journalists in America.
Reporters may write and politicians may talk but what you draw remains in the public memory long after these other words are forgotten.
That is why, after I learned that you would be here and we would meet together, I put together some notes to discuss with you while you were in Washington, a very little known side of our activity in one of the most vital places in the worldSouth Viet-Nam.
The war in Viet-Nam has many faces.
There is the face of armed conflictof terror and gunfireof bomb-heavy planes and campaign-weary soldiers.
In this conflict our only object is to prove that force will meet force, that armed conquest is futile, and that aggression is not only wrong, but it just will not work.
And the Communists in Viet-Nam are slowly beginning to realize what they once scorned to believe: that we combine unlimited patience with unlimited resources in pursuit of an unwavering purpose.
We will not abandon our commitment to South Viet-Nam.
The second face of war in Viet-Nam is the quest for a political solution, the face of diplomacy and politics, of the ambitions and the interests of other nations.
We know, as our adversaries should also know, that there is no purely military solution in sight for either side.
We are ready for unconditional discussions.
Most of the non-Communist nations of the world favor such unconditional discussions.
And it would dearly be in the interest of North Viet-Nam to now come to the conference table.
For them the continuation of war, without talks, means only damage without conquest.
Communist China apparently desires the war to continue whatever the cost to their allies.
Their target is not merely South Viet-Nam; it is Asia.
Their objective is not the fulfillment of Vietnamese nationalism; it is to erode and to discredit America's ability to help prevent Chinese domination over all of Asia.
In this domination they shall never succeed.
And I am continuing and I am increasing the search for every possible path to peace.
The third face of war in Viet-Nam is, at once, the most tragic and most hopeful.
It is the face of human need.
It is the untended sick, the hungry family, and the illiterate child.
It is men and women, many without shelter, with rags for clothing, struggling for survival in a very rich and a very fertile land.
It is the most important battle of all in which we are engaged.
For a nation cannot be built by armed power or by political agreement.
It will rest on the expectation by individual men and women that their future will be better than their past.
It is not enough to just fight against something.
People must fight for something, and the people of South Viet-Nam must know that after the long, brutal journey through the dark tunnel of conflict there breaks the light of a happier day.
And only if this is so, can they be expected to sustain the enduring will for continued strife.
Only in this way can long-run stability and peace come to their land.
And there is another, more profound reason.
In Viet-Nam communism seeks to really impose its will by force of arms.
But we would be deeply mistaken to think that this was the only weapon.
Here, as other places in the world, they speak to restless peoplepeople rising to shatter the old ways which have imprisoned hopepeople fiercely and justly reaching for the material fruits from the tree of modern knowledge.
It is this desire, and not simply lust for conquest, which moves many of the individual fighting men that we must now, sadly, call the enemy.
It is, therefore, our task to show that freedom from the control of other nations offers the surest road to progress, that history and experience testify to this truth.
But it is not enough to call upon reason or point to examples.
We must show it through action and we must show it through accomplishment.
And even were there no wareither hot or coldwe would always be active in humanity's search for progress.
This task is commanded to us by the moral values of our civilization, and it rests on the inescapable nature of the world that we have now entered.
For in that world, as long as we can foresee, every threat to man's welfare will be a threat to the welfare of our own people.
Those who live in the emerging community of nations will ignore the perils of their neighbors at the risk of their own prospects.
This is true not only for Viet-Nam but for every part of the developing world.
This is why, on your behalf, I recently proposed a massive, cooperative development effort for all of southeast Asia.
I named the respected leader, Eugene Black, as my personal representative to inaugurate our participation in these programs.
Since that time rapid progress has been made, I am glad to report.
Black has met with the top officials of the United Nations on several occasions.
He has talked to other interested parties.
He has found increasing enthusiasm.
The United Nations is already setting up new mechanisms to help carry forward the work of development.
In addition, the United States is now prepared to participate in, and to support, an Asian Development Bank, to carry out and help finance the economic progress in that area of the world and the development that we desire to see in that area of the world.
So this morning I call on every other industrialized nation, including the Soviet Union, to help create a better life for all of the people of southeast Asia.
Surely, surely, the works of peace can bring men together in a common effort to abandon forever the works of war!But, as South Viet-Nam is the central place of conflict, it is also a principal focus of our work to increase the well-being of people.
It is in that effort in South Viet-Nam which I think we are too little informed and which I want to relate to you this morning.
We began in 1954 when Viet-Nam became independent, before the war between the North and the South.
Since that time we have spent more than $2 billion in economic help for the 16 million people of South Viet-Nam.
And despite the ravages of war we have made steady continuing gains.
We have concentrated on food, and health, and education, and housing, and industry.
Like most developing countries, South Viet-Nam's economy rests on agriculture.
Unlike many, it has large uncrowded areas of very rich and very fertile land.
Because of this, it is one of the great rice bowls of the entire world.
With our help, since 1954, South Viet-Nam has already doubled its rice production, providing food for the people, as well as providing a vital export for that nation.
We have put our American farm know-how to work on other crops.
This year, for instance, several hundred million cuttings of a new variety of sweet potato, that promises a sixfold increase in yield, will be distributed to these Vietnamese farmers.
Corn output should rise from 25,000 tons in 1962 to 100,000 tons by 1966.
Pig production has more than doubled since 1955 Many animal diseases have been eliminated entirely.
Disease and epidemic brood over every Vietnamese village.
In a country of more than 16 million people with a life expectancy of only 35 years, there are only 200 civilian doctors.
If the Vietnamese had doctors in the same ratio as the United States has doctors, they would have not the 200 that they do have but they would have more than 5,000 doctors.
We have helped vaccinate, already, over 7 million people against cholera, and millions more against other diseases.
Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese can now receive treatment in the more than 12,000 hamlet health stations that America has built and has stocked.
New clinics and surgical suites are scattered throughout that entire country; and the medical school that we are now helping to build will graduate as many doctors in a single year as now serve the entire population of South Viet-Nam.
Education is the keystone of future development in Viet-Nam.
It takes a trained people to man the factories, to conduct the administration, to form the human foundation for an advancing nation.
More than a quarter million young Vietnamese can now learn in more than 4,000 classrooms that America has helped to build in the last 2 years; and 2,000 more schools are going to be built by us in the next 12 months.
The number of students in vocational schools has gone up four times.
Enrollment was 300,000 in 1955, when we first entered there and started helping with our program.
Today it is more than 1 1/2 million.
The 8 million textbooks that we have supplied to Vietnamese children will rise to more than 15 million by 1967.
Agriculture is the foundation.
Health, education, and housing are the urgent human needs.
But industrial development is the great pathway to their future.
When Viet-Nam was divided, most of the industry was in the North.
The South was barren of manufacturing and the foundations for industry.
But today, more than 700 new or rehabilitated factories-textile mills and cement plants, electronics and plasticsare changing the entire face of that nation.
New roads and communications, railroad equipment and electric generators, are a spreading base on which this new industry can, and is, growing.
All this progress goes on, and it is going to continue to go on, under circumstances of staggering adversity.
Communist terrorists have made AID programs that we administer a very special target of their attack.
They fear them.
They know they must fear them because agricultural stations are being destroyed and medical centers are being burned.
More than 100 Vietnamese malaria fighters are dead.
Our own AID officials have been wounded and killed and kidnapped.
These are not just the accidents of war.
They are a part of a deliberate campaign, in the words of the Communists themselves, to cut the fingers off the hands of the government.
We intend to continue, and we intend to increase our help to Viet-Nam.
Nor can anyone doubt the determination of the South Vietnamese themselves.
They have lost more than 12,000 of their men since I became your President a little over a year ago.
But progress does not come from investment alone, or plans on a desk, or even the directives and the orders that we approve here in Washington.
It takes men.
Men must take the seed to the farmer.
Men must teach the use of fertilizer.
Men must help in harvest.
Men must build the schools, and men must instruct the students.
Men must carry medicine into the jungle and treat the sick, and shelter the homeless.
And menbrave, tireless, filled with love for their fellowsare doing this today.
They are doing it through the long, hot, danger-filled Vietnamese days and the sultry nights.
The fullest glory must go, also, to those South Vietnamese that are laboring and dying for their own people and their own nation.
In hospitals and schools, along the rice fields and the roads, they continue to labor, never knowing when death or terror may strike.
How incredible it is that there are a few who still say that the South Vietnamese do not want to continue this struggle.
They are sacrificing and they are dying by the thousands.
Their patient valor in the heavy presence of personal, physical danger should be a helpful lesson to those of us who, here in America, only have to read about it, or hear about it on the television or radio.
We have our own heroes who labor at the works of peace in the midst of war.
They toil unarmed and out of uniform.
They know the humanity of their concern does not exempt them from the horrors of conflict, yet they go on from day to day.
They bring food to the hungry over there.
They supply the sick with necessary medicine.
They help the farmer with his crops, families to find clean water, villages to receive the healing miracles of electricity.
These are Americans who have joined our AID program, and we welcome others to their ranks.
For most Americans this is an easy war.
Men fight and men suffer and men die, as they always must in war.
But the lives of most of us, at least those of us in this room and those listening to me this morning, are untroubled.
Prosperity rises, abundance increases, the Nation flourishes.
I will report to the Cabinet when I leave this room that we are in the 51st month of continued prosperity, the longest peacetime prosperity for America since our country was founded.
Yet our entire future is at stake.
What a difference it would make if we could only call upon a small fraction of our unmatched private resourcesbusinesses and unions, agricultural groups and builders-if we could call them to the task of peaceful progress in Viet-Nam.
With such a spirit of patriotic sacrifice we might well strike an irresistible blow for freedom there and for freedom throughout the world.
I, therefore, hope that every person within the sound of my voice in this country this morning will look for waysand those citizens of other nations who believe in humanity as we do, I hope that they will find ways to help progress in South Viet-Nam.
This, then, is the third face of our struggle in Viet-Nam.
It was therethe illiterate, the hungry, the sickbefore this war began.
It will be there when peace comes to us-and so will we.
Not with soldiers and planes, not with bombs and bullets, but with all the wondrous weapons of peace in the 30th century.
And then, perhaps, together, all of the people in the world can share that gracious task with all the people of Viet-Nam, North and South alike.
Thank you for coming this morning.
Good morning.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
The situation in the Dominican Republic continues to be serious.
That is why we welcome the additional efforts which are being made in the OAS today to enlarge and to strengthen the efforts to find a peaceful settlement there.
We continue to give our full support to Secretary General Mora 1 in his outstanding service under existing OAS resolutions, but we share his judgment that a very strong and sustained effort is going to continue to be needed.
Meanwhile, I have been advised today by General Alvim, the Commander in Chief of the Inter-American Force, and by Lieutenant General Palmer, the Deputy Commander of the Inter-American Force, that conditions in the Dominican Republic will now permit the further withdrawal of the United States military personnel from the Inter-American Force.
This recommendation has the concurrence of Secretary General Mora and Ambassador Bennett.
I am, therefore, accordingly, ordering the immediate withdrawal of one battalion landing team of United States Marines, plus headquarters and supporting personnel.
This will total approximately 2,000 people.
Now to another subject.
This month of June marks a very historic anniversary in the affairs of man.
Twenty years ago, while war still raged in the world, the nations of Europe assembled at San Francisco to sign the charter of hope that brought into being the United Nations.
Men were mindful that in these times humankind must choose between cooperation or catastrophe.
At San Francisco there was brought into being a great instrumentality for international cooperation, and we can believe today that the cooperation engendered by the United Nations has helped to avert catastrophe in this century.
So today we have to work not on the things that divide us, but instead on the things that unite nations in the bonds of common interest.
On June 24th, 25th, and 26th of this year, the General Assembly of the United Nations will meet for commemorative sessions in San Francisco.
It is my hope and plan at this time to be in San Francisco and to address the delegates at that time during the meetings of the sessions there.
This afternoon I am sending to the Congress a very special message requesting an additional appropriation to help in the peaceful economic and social development of southeast Asia.
This is another forward step toward carrying out my April proposal for a massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict-torn corner of the world.
The American people, I think, want their own Government to be not only strong but compassionate.
They know that a society is secure only when there is full social justice for all of its people, and these principles of compassion and justice never stop at the water's edge.
So we do not intend that the enemies of freedom shall become the inheritors of man's worldwide revolt against injustice and misery.
Therefore, we expect to lead in that struggle, not to conquer or to subdue, but to give each people the chance to build its own nation in its own way.
My personal representative,  Eugene Black, has already begun extensive and hopeful discussions with interested parties around the world.
Thus, the groundwork has already been laid for a long-range development plan for all of southeast Asia, led by Asians, to improve the life of Asians.
In South Viet-Nam today, brave and enduring people are carrying on a determined resistance against those who would destroy their independence.
They will win this fight, and the United States of America is going to help them win it.
But there is another and a much more profound struggle going on in that country, and that is the struggle to create the conditions of hope and progress which are really the only lasting guarantees of peace and stability.
The 16 million people of South Viet-Nam survive on an average income of $100 per year.
More than 60 percent of the people have never learned to read or write.
When disease strikes, medical care is often impossible to find.
As I remarked the other day here, there is only one doctor for every 29,000 people, compared with one for every 740 in the United States.
They have 200 doctors; whereas, they need 5,000.
This poverty and this neglect take their inevitable toll in human life.
The life expectancy there is only 35 years.
That is just about half what it is in our country.
Now, we think that these are the common enemies of man in South Viet-Nam.
They were there before the aggressor struck.
They, of course, will be there when aggression is completely gone.
These enemies, too, we are committed to help defeat.
Today's request will be used to help develop the vast water and power resources of the Mekong basin.
They will be used to bring electricity to small towns in the provinces.
We have had REA teams, as you know, there working for several weeks making these surveys and planning to build several REA systems.
We will build clinics and provide doctors for disease-ridden rural areas.
We will help South Viet-Nam import materials for their homes and their factories, and in addition, the members of the American Medical Association have already agreed with us to try to recruit surgeons and specialists, approximately 50 of them.
We are particularly very much in need of plastic surgeons to go to Viet-Nam to help heal the wounds of war and to help them, as well, to deal with the ravages of unchecked disease.
Now, this is just a part of the beginning.
This appropriation today calls for only $89 million, but in the future I will call upon our people to make further sacrifices because this is a good program, and the starts that we are making today are good starts.
This is the only way that I know in which we can really win not only the military battle against aggression, but the wider war for the freedom and for progress of all men.
Now I will be glad to take any questions you may have.
Yes.
I think that we are very delighted that for the first time in history, we have presently on the military side an Inter-American Force that is functioning-and functioning effectivelyunder the leadership of General Alvim in the Dominican Republic.
A good many of the nations in this hemisphere are supplying forces to that Inter-American Force, and others will be making contributions, we hope, in the next few days.
On the political side, we are now considering the Organization of American States' certain solutions for the Dominican Republic which could very well serve as an indication of what might come in similar situations down the road.
We have had very enlightened and very positive leadership under  Mora, the Secretary General of the OAS, in the Dominican Republic, and we hope not only can they supply forces to help provide the military answer to the necessities in that field, but that they can evolve a formula that will provide judicious determinations in connection with political judgments that we need to make in the near future.
US EFFORTS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC  Yes, I will be very glad to.
We found it necessary, in order to preserve our own citizens' lives, and in order to stop the wholesale killing of hundreds and even thousands of Dominicans, to intervene in the Dominican Republic.
Since that time, we have counseled at great length and sought the assistance of the OAS in connection with contributing the military forces that would bring about a cease-fire and preserve the peace.
At the same time, we have urged the OAS to establish machinery to help find a political solution, and awaiting the establishment of that machinery, which we are really considering in the OAS today, we have sent some of the best people in this Government to maintain contacts with the broad base of leadership in the Dominican Republic in the hope that there would, in due time, evolve a broadly based government that would meet with the approval of the Dominican people.
I have had  Vance,  Bundy,  Mann,  Vaughn,6 and others maintain liaison with various leaders of various groups there.
Those conferences have been taking place from day to day and we have been keeping the OAS and their representatives fully informed.
We are hopeful that in due time they will reach conclusions as to how they think it can be best handled and that we will be able to contribute our part and cooperate with them.
As you know, they were discussing the matter over the weekend and today, and we hope that a decision will be in the offing in the immediate future.
We have no desire to insist upon our particular brand of military solution or political solution.
We think it is an inter-American matter, and we want to cooperate fully with them.
Prior to our intervention, we consulted and discussed the gravity of the situation there with 14 Latin American nations, beginning on Saturday when the revolution took place, up through Wednesday when we sent the Marines in.
During that same period, we met with the Peace Committee of the OAS on Tuesday, and we met with the OAS Council on Wednesday.
It has been our desire all along to contribute all we could to a cease-fire, to the eventual evolution of a stable government that would be broadly based, and to make our appropriate contribution to the necessary reconstruction of that country.
We feel that when the OAS reaches its decision, that that decision will be communicated to the people of the Dominican Republic.
We hope that they will be able to find agreement between the inter-American body and the folks there that will ultimately lead to an expression of opinion by the people of the Dominican Republic and ultimately lead to a broadly based government that will include none of the extremes.
I think that is a matter not for the President to determine.
No, I do not think so.
I think it may have had that objective in mind.
That may have been its purpose.
But you know the old storywhen a man gets in the role of a mediator, both sides usually hit at him.
But we think, as I said in my opening statement, that the Secretary General has performed a very useful role, a very intelligent one, and a very objective one, and we have every confidence in his efforts.
We have regretted to see the attacks come upon him as we have regretted to see the attacks come upon us.
But we much prefer the attacks to what could have happened except for our action and except for his action.
I will answer the latter question first.
I think that this administration profits from the suggestions and recommendations of leaders in other branches of government, from men who occupy public platforms, from general discussions.
I think that is the strength of the American system, instead of a weakness.
I am hopeful that every person will always exercise the free speech that the Constitution guarantees him, and I would prefer, of course, that it be constructive and it be responsible, and I think generally that has been true.
I am glad that I live in a nation where, in the midst of conflict, when men are dying to preserve our freedom, that our citizens still do not fear to exercise it, and I can assure you that they do exercise it.
We had anticipated that we would have some actions of this type at this season of the year.
We have had a rather serious engagement in the last few hours, in the most immediate past.
The South Vietnamese have lost, according to the reports we have, dozens, even hundreds, of people.
We do not know exactly the extent of the Viet Cong losses, although we believe them to be substantial.
We do not announce those, perhaps unfortunately, along with the announcement of our own losses.
We know how many we lose, but we do not know how many they lose until we get out there and count them, so their losses never really catch up with the original story of our losses.
Suffice it to say I think it has been serious.
We are concerned about it.
It is occupying our attention.
As you know, General Taylor plans to be here in the next few days and he will probably have more definite information at that time, just about the details of this particular engagement.
Oh, no.
If you want me to elaborate on that a little bit, I will say that the threat was greater before 21,000 Americans arrived there.
It always is.
The Communists did not, in our judgment, originate this revolution, but they joined it and South Viet-Nam.
they participated in it.
They were active in it, and in a good many places they were in charge of it.
We think that following the action that this Nation tookit served a very good purpose and some of the men who had originally participated in the revolution, and had to take asylum, returned, and more moderate forces took leadershipthe Communist elements have not been so active, although their presence is still noted hour by hour.
Their effectiveness is still observed.
From day to day we see their handiwork in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere throughout the world, particularly in the propaganda field.
I would not want to anticipate what action the OAS is going to take.
The President does not take action in connection with constitutional amendments.
I have reviewed some of the proposals that have been made.
I am generally sympathetic with the reapportionments taking place throughout the country in compliance with the Supreme Court's decision.
I would not want to get into detailed discussion of the individual programs about which the President will not act one way or the other, because a constitutional amendment does not require White House action.
It is a matter for the representatives of the people to decide.
In submitting it, the Congress takes that action.
The people themselves have an opportunity to judge it.
When the Congress does get down to debating the question and considering it, I will, of course, spend some time on it and become thoroughly conversant with it, but I would not want to predict at this time just what measure would emerge in the form of an amendment or what action Congress or the people might take on it.
No.
I do not see that I can do you any good, the country any good, or myself any good by discussing future operational plans.
I know of no real reason why we ought to photograph them or decide them until we are confronted with that possibility.
I do not.
No.
I am afraid that the people that have branded the Johnson doctrine were unfamiliar with the fact that the nations of this hemisphere have repeatedly made it clear that the principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of the inter-American system, just as President Kennedy made it abundantly clear.
That is the basis of our own attitude on the matter, as I explained in my television appearance.
That does not mean, of course, that this Government is opposed to change.
The greatest purpose of the Alliance for Progress, which we are working on so hard and making such substantial contributions to, is to encourage economic and social change.
We believe that will benefit all the people of this hemisphere.
We are doing our best to provide encouragement for those changes.
But I think it is a well-known and well-advertised doctrine of the hemisphere that the principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of our inter-American system.
President Kennedy enunciated that on several occasions.
The OAS itself has enunciated that.
I merely repeated it.
I am sorry I got some folks excited by it.
I will answer your first one.
I do not want to get into personalities.
Go ahead.
We have taken several steps in the order of priority that we felt was required.
Many months ago we became aware of the increasing tensions there, and the difficulties that would likely confront us.
On the Sunday before we went in there on Wednesday, we asked the Ambassador, who had already come to Washington at our calling, to leave his family's home and come here to meet with us.
Ambassador Bennett met with us on Monday.
We rushed him back to the Dominican Republic and set in motion certain steps.
First, was to attempt to obtain a cease-fire.
Second, was to take the precautionary steps necessary to protect approximately 5,000 Americans, as well as thousands of other nationals, if that should be required.
We moved our ships up there on Sunday.
The Ambassador arrived there on Monday.
He talked to various leaders.
We did all we could to bring about a cease-fire in cooperation with the Papal Nuncio and others who were active on the scene.
On Wednesday at noon it became apparent that danger was lurking around the corner and the Ambassador gave us a warning in a cable about 1 of the clock.
We had met on Monday and we had met on Tuesday.
We had met on Wednesday and we had had many conversations on Sunday that we did not issue any handouts on.
During that period, I think from the time we were notified on Saturday, until we intervened on Wednesday, we spent a good part of both day and night giving our attention to this matter, from moving the ships up to making the final decision.
I had 237 individual conversations during that period and about 35 meetings with various people.
Finally, on Wednesday afternoon at 4-something, we got another warning that we should have a contingent plan ready immediately, and a little before 6 of the clock we got a plea, a unanimous plea from the entire country team, made up of the Ambassador, the AID Director, CIA and the USIA, and the Army, Navy, and the Air Force, to land troops immediately to save American lives.
Now, of course, we knew of the forces at work in the Dominican Republic.
We were not unaware that there were Communists that were active in this effort, but 99 percent of our reason for going in there was to try to provide protection for these American lives and for the lives of other nationals.
We asked our Ambassador to summon all our people immediately to the Ambassador Hotel, to put them in one central group.
In the presence of Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, Secretary Ball,10  Bundy, and  Moyers11 of my staff, we consulted with the Latin American desk,  Vaughn and his experts, and  Vance and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
In the neighborhood of 6 of the clock Wednesday evening we made the decision, it was a unanimous decision, about which there was no difference of opinion either at the Dominican Republic level, or the country team, or the Cabinet level here, to send in the troops.
We did not want to announce that they were on their way until they had landed, for obvious security reasons.
But when I made the decision, I pointed out to the Secretary of State that we had been consulting since the weekend with some 14 Latin American nations, that we had had a meeting of the Peace Committee of the OAS, and we had had a meeting of the Council of the OAS I thought it was very important that we notify all the Latin American Ambassadors forthwith.
So the decision was to notify the Congress and ask them to come down so we could review with them developments, notify the Ambassadors, and ask for an immediate session of the OAS, and to notify the troops, because the lives of our citizens were in danger.
Men were running up and down the corridors of the Ambassador Hotel with tommy-guns, shooting out windows, and through the roof and through the closets.
Our citizens were under the beds and in the closets and trying to dodge this gunfire.
Our Ambassador, as he was talking to us, was under the desk.
We did not think we had much time to consult in any great detail more than we had talked about up to that time, but we did make the announcement about 8 of the clock and immediately asked the OAS for an urgent meeting the next morning.
Since that time we have had two purposes in mind: One was for them to take action that would give us a military presence and provide a military solution so that we could quit killing people.
I think that the Armed Forces are entitled to one of the greatest tributes ever paid that group in war or peace for the marvelous operation they conducted.
They moved in there and landed within an hour from the time the Commander in Chief made the decision.
They surrounded the hotel and protected the lives of a thousand American citizens and many hundreds of other nationals.
They did not lose one civilian.
They opened the route of 7 miles to the port and they evacuated 5,600 people.
Those people came from 46 different countries.
The next step that we thought should be followed was to provide food and clothing and sustenance for those people, so we sent an economic team of 32 people, headed by  Solomon,12 who was sworn in today as Assistant Under Secretary of State in charge of economic matters.
And we started feeding the 3? million people of the Dominican Republic.
We have provided food and other necessities, medicine, since that time, to those people without regard to which side they were on.
In addition, we have treated more than 15,000 with our medical facilities.
So having gone in and secured the place, having evacuated 5,600 people, and now the commercial planes are running and they can come out on their own stint, having obtained a cease-fire, having provided the economic aid, having sent our best people there to talk to all groups and all factions and leadership, to try to find a government that would appeal to all the Dominican people, we now think that there are two essential things that are left to be done: One is to find a broadly based government under the leadership of the OAS that will be acceptable and approved by the Dominican people; and second, to engage in the comprehensive task of reconstruction of that nation, in trying to make it possible for 3 1/2 million to have an economic comeback.
Thank you,  President.
Nabrit, my fellow Americans: I am delighted at the chance to speak at this important and this historic institution.
Howard has long been an outstanding center for the education of Negro Americans.
Its students are of every race and color and they come from many countries of the world.
It is truly a working example of democratic excellence.
Our earth is the home of revolution.
In every corner of every continent men charged with hope contend with ancient ways in the pursuit of justice.
They reach for the newest of weapons to realize the oldest of dreams, that each may walk in freedom and pride, stretching his talents, enjoying the fruits of the earth.
Our enemies may occasionally seize the day of change, but it is the banner of our revolution they take.
And our own future is linked to this process of swift and turbulent change in many lands in the world.
But nothing in any country touches us more profoundly, and nothing is more freighted with meaning for our own destiny than the revolution of the Negro American.
In far too many ways American Negroes have been another nation: deprived of freedom, crippled by hatred, the doors of opportunity closed to hope.
In our time change has come to this Nation, too.
The American Negro, acting with impressive restraint, has peacefully protested and marched, entered the courtrooms and the seats of government, demanding a justice that has long been denied.
The voice of the Negro was the call to action.
But it is a tribute to America that, once aroused, the courts and the Congress, the President and most of the people, have been the allies of progress.
Thus we have seen the high court of the country declare that discrimination based on race was repugnant to the Constitution, and therefore void.
We have seen in 1957, and 1960, and again in 1964, the first civil rights legislation in this Nation in almost an entire century.
As majority leader of the United States Senate, I helped to guide two of these bills through the Senate.
And, as your President, I was proud to sign the third.
And now very soon we will have the fourth  a new law guaranteeing every American the right to vote.
No act of my entire administration will give me greater satisfaction than the day when my signature makes this bill, too, the law of this land.
The voting rights bill will be the latest, and among the most important, in a long series of victories.
But this victory  as Winston Churchill said of another triumph for freedom  is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.
But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
That beginning is freedom; and the barriers to that freedom are tumbling down.
Freedom is the right to share, share fully and equally, in American society  to vote, to hold a job, to enter a public place, to go to school.
It is the right to be treated in every part of our national life as a person equal in dignity and promise to all others.
But freedom is not enough.
You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please.
You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, you are free to compete with all the others, and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.
Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity.
All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.
This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights.
We seek not just freedom but opportunity.
We seek not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result.
For the task is to give 20 million Negroes the same chance as every other American to learn and grow, to work and share in society, to develop their abilities  physical, mental and spiritual, and to pursue their individual happiness.
To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not enough.
Men and women of all races are born with the same range of abilities.
But ability is not just the product of birth.
Ability is stretched or stunted by the family that you live with, and the neighborhood you live in  by the school you go to and the poverty or the richness of your surroundings.
It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child, and finally the man.
This graduating class at Howard University is witness to the indomitable determination of the Negro American to win his way in American life.
The number of Negroes in schools of higher learning has almost doubled in 15 years.
The number of nonwhite professional workers has more than doubled in 10 years.
The median income of Negro college women tonight exceeds that of white college women.
And there are also the enormous accomplishments of distinguished individual Negroes  many of them graduates of this institution, and one of them the first lady ambassador in the history of the United States.
These are proud and impressive achievements.
But they tell only the story of a growing middle class minority, steadily narrowing the gap between them and their white counterparts.
But for the great majority of Negro Americans  the poor, the unemployed, the uprooted, and the dispossessed  there is a much grimmer story.
They still, as we meet here tonight, are another nation.
Despite the court orders and the laws, despite the legislative victories and the speeches, for them the walls are rising and the gulf is widening.
Here are some of the facts of this American failure.
Thirty-five years ago the rate of unemployment for Negroes and whites was about the same.
Tonight the Negro rate is twice as high.
In 1948 the 8 percent unemployment rate for Negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites.
By last year that rate had grown to 23 percent, as against 13 percent for whites unemployed.
Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of this country.
From 1952 to 1963 the median income of Negro families compared to white actually dropped from 57 percent to 53 percent.
In the years 1955 through 1957, 22 percent of experienced Negro workers were out of work at some time during the year.
In 1961 through 1963 that proportion had soared to 29 percent.
Since 1947 the number of white families living in poverty has decreased 27 percent while the number of poorer nonwhite families decreased only 3 percent.
The infant mortality of nonwhites in 1940 was 70 percent greater than whites.
Twenty-two years later it was 90 percent greater.
Moreover, the isolation of Negro from white communities is increasing, rather than decreasing as Negroes crowd into the central cities and become a city within a city.
Of course Negro Americans as well as white Americans have shared in our rising national abundance.
But the harsh fact of the matter is that in the battle for true equality too many  far too many  are losing ground every day.
We are not completely sure why this is.
We know the causes are complex and subtle.
But we do know the two broad basic reasons.
And we do know that we have to act.
First, Negroes are trapped  as many whites are trapped  in inherited, gate-less poverty.
They lack training and skills.
They are shut in, in slums, without decent medical care.
Private and public poverty combine to cripple their capacities.
We are trying to attack these evils through our poverty program, through our education program, through our medical care and our other health programs, and a dozen more of the Great Society programs that are aimed at the root causes of this poverty.
We will increase, and we will accelerate, and we will broaden this attack in years to come until this most enduring of foes finally yields to our unyielding will.
But there is a second cause  much more difficult to explain, more deeply grounded, more desperate in its force.
It is the devastating heritage of long years of slavery; and a century of oppression, hatred, and injustice.
For Negro poverty is not white poverty.
Many of its causes and many of its cures are the same.
But there are differences  deep, corrosive, obstinate differences  radiating painful roots into the community, and into the family, and the nature of the individual.
These differences are not racial differences.
They are solely and simply the consequence of ancient brutality, past injustice, and present prejudice.
They are anguishing to observe.
For the Negro they are a constant reminder of oppression.
For the white they are a constant reminder of guilt.
But they must be faced and they must be dealt with and they must be overcome, if we are ever to reach the time when the only difference between Negroes and whites is the color of their skin.
Nor can we find a complete answer in the experience of other American minorities.
They made a valiant and a largely successful effort to emerge from poverty and prejudice.
The Negro, like these others, will have to rely mostly upon his own efforts.
But he just can not do it alone.
For they did not have the heritage of centuries to overcome, and they did not have a cultural tradition which had been twisted and battered by endless years of hatred and hopelessness, nor were they excluded  these others  because of race or color  a feeling whose dark intensity is matched by no other prejudice in our society.
Nor can these differences be understood as isolated infirmities.
They are a seamless web.
They cause each other.
They result from each other.
They reinforce each other.
Much of the Negro community is buried under a blanket of history and circumstance.
It is not a lasting solution to lift just one corner of that blanket.
We must stand on all sides and we must raise the entire cover if we are to liberate our fellow citizens.
One of the differences is the increased concentration of Negroes in our cities.
More than 73 percent of all Negroes live in urban areas compared with less than 70 percent of the whites.
Most of these Negroes live in slums.
Most of these Negroes live together  a separated people.
Men are shaped by their world.
When it is a world of decay, ringed by an invisible wall, when escape is arduous and uncertain, and the saving pressures of a more hopeful society are unknown, it can cripple the youth and it can desolate the men.
There is also the burden that a dark skin can add to the search for a productive place in our society.
Unemployment strikes most swiftly and broadly at the Negro, and this burden erodes hope.
Blighted hope breeds despair.
Despair brings indifferences to the learning which offers a way out.
And despair, coupled with indifferences, is often the source of destructive rebellion against the fabric of society.
There is also the lacerating hurt of early collision with white hatred or prejudice, distaste or condescension.
Other groups have felt similar intolerance.
But success and achievement could wipe it away.
They do not change the color of a man's skin.
I have seen this uncomprehending pain in the eyes of the little, young Mexican-American schoolchildren that I taught many years ago.
But it can be overcome.
But, for many, the wounds are always open.
Perhaps most important  its influence radiating to every part of life  is the breakdown of the Negro family structure.
For this, most of all, white America must accept responsibility.
It flows from centuries of oppression and persecution of the Negro man.
It flows from the long years of degradation and discrimination, which have attacked his dignity and assaulted his ability to produce for his family.
This, too, is not pleasant to look upon.
But it must be faced by those whose serious intent is to improve the life of all Americans.
Only a minority  less than half  of all Negro children reach the age of 18 having lived all their lives with both of their parents.
At this moment, tonight, little less than two-thirds are at home with both of their parents.
Probably a majority of all Negro children receive federally-aided public assistance sometime during their childhood.
The family is the cornerstone of our society.
More than any other force it shapes the attitude, the hopes, the ambitions, and the values of the child.
And when the family collapses it is the children that are usually damaged.
When it happens on a massive scale the community itself is crippled.
So, unless we work to strengthen the family, to create conditions under which most parents will stay together  all the rest: schools, and playgrounds, and public assistance, and private concern, will never be enough to cut completely the circle of despair and deprivation.
There is no single easy answer to all of these problems.
Jobs are part of the answer.
They bring the income which permits a man to provide for his family.
Decent homes in decent surroundings and a chance to learn  an equal chance to learn  are part of the answer.
Welfare and social programs better designed to hold families together are part of the answer.
Care for the sick is part of the answer.
An understanding heart by all Americans is another big part of the answer.
And to all of these fronts  and a dozen more  I will dedicate the expanding efforts of the Johnson administration.
But there are other answers that are still to be found.
Nor do we fully understand even all of the problems.
Therefore, I want to announce tonight that this fall I intend to call a White House conference of scholars, and experts, and outstanding Negro leaders  men of both races  and officials of Government at every level.
This White House conference's theme and title will be To Fulfill These Rights.
Its object will be to help the American Negro fulfill the rights which, after the long time of injustice, he is finally about to secure.
To move beyond opportunity to achievement.
To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice, but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin.
To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong  great wrong  to the children of God.
And I pledge you tonight that this will be a chief goal of my administration, and of my program next year, and in the years to come.
And I hope, and I pray, and I believe, it will be a part of the program of all America.
For what is justice? It is to fulfill the fair expectations of man.
Thus, American justice is a very special thing.
For, from the first, this has been a land of towering expectations.
It was to be a nation where each man could be ruled by the common consent of all  enshrined in law, given life by institutions, guided by men themselves subject to its rule.
And all  all of every station and origin  would be touched equally in obligation and in liberty.
Beyond the law lay the land.
It was a rich land, glowing with more abundant promise than man had ever seen.
Here, unlike any place yet known, all were to share the harvest.
And beyond this was the dignity of man.
Each could become whatever his qualities of mind and spirit would permit  to strive, to seek, and, if he could, to find his happiness.
This is American justice.
We have pursued it faithfully to the edge of our imperfections, and we have failed to find it for the American Negro.
So, it is the glorious opportunity of this generation to end the one huge wrong of the American Nation and, in so doing, to find America for ourselves, with the same immense thrill of discovery which gripped those who first began to realize that here, at last, was a home for freedom.
All it will take is for all of us to understand what this country is and what this country must become.
The Scripture promises: I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out.
Together, and with millions more, we can light that candle of understanding in the heart of all America.
And, once lit, it will never again go out.
Webb,  Dryden,  Seamans, my fellow Americans: Monday was a very happy day for you and for the Nation, but this opportunity to visit with all the members of America's space team is no anticlimax for me.
So, to each of you who contributed to the success of America's most historic peacetime adventure, I am proud and I am privileged to say to each and to all of you: Well done.
The television commentators and the newspaper writers have all had a good bit to say about the sterling qualities and virtues of Major McDivitt and Major White.
Of course, I have detected a certain greater objectivity in the remarks made publicly by both of their lovely wives.
Be that as it may, what impresses and gratifies me most about these two heroes-and all of the other astronautsis the quality of personal modesty and humility.
I have not yet met a man who has not come down from space wanting to give more credit to all the men and women on the ground than he would accept for himself up there.
Ed and Jim are no exceptions.
I invited them to bring their families to the ranch tomorrow, or the next day, because I wanted to present both of them with a token of their country's great esteem and respect.
But I learned last night from the Administrator,  Webb, that both men felt a ceremony at the ranch would focus too much credit on them and exclude all of you who supported their flight here so impressively at this new NASA Spacecenter in Houston.
So, we have arranged our plans gladly to come herewith one proviso.
A little later, next week or the early part of the following week, we expect to see the McDivitts and their three children, and the Whites and their two children, and the manager of the Gemini program,  Mathews and his family, in Washington at the White House.
At that time we are going to pay them the honor all of you know they deserve, no matter what they say about it.
But today, as I said to you when we were talking a few hours ago, I promised to bring these two heroes a little token.
Well, I am going to keep my promise.
I am nominating Major McDivitt and Major White for promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel for their spectacular achievements on behalf of all the people of their country and the free world.
And I am saying, also, that that is something you can eat as well as wear.
Incidentally, I might announce today that Maj.
Gordon Cooper will be promoted on July 15th to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
And I am not going to forget the fourth Air Force astronaut to make an orbital flight, so I complete my announcement today by nominating Maj.
Gus Grissom for promotion to lieutenant colonel, also.
When our manned space program began, many said about space what men probably said 500 years before about America itself-that the environment was hostile, that the climate was no good, that there was nothing there worth the trip anyway.
These two young Americans have changed that conception forever.
All people have a new sense of thrill, and excitement, and anticipation about space exploration because of the flight of Gemini 4.
The joy and the thrill and the exhilaration that Ed White experienced on his walk from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic ran through the veins of us all.
Our attitudes about space will never entirely be the same again.
And let me make one other observation.
I read with mixed emotions yesterday that Major White had decided to claim this State of his birth as his home State.
Well, as President, I am supposed to be neutral on matters of State pride, but the glimmer of pride I allow myself to feel is subdued just a bit.
I know some will say that as soon as Americans got themselves up into space a Texan had to go and put his foot in it.
Seriously, I hope that the clear and obvious meaning and promise of this great adventure, which all of you have really shared, will not be lost upon mankind.
Only a few years ago, this great Nation was unmistakably behind in space.
Abroadand at homesome prophesied that America would remain behind, that our system had failed, that the brightness of our future had dimmed and would grow darker.
But no such prophecies are heard today.
Proceeding openlyopenly admitting our failures, openly sharing and offering to share our successesthe United States of America has proceeded with the determination and the zeal that burns in the hearts of men who love liberty.
And, today, we know that America's success is very great indeed.
All that we have accomplished in space-all that we may accomplish in days and years to comewe stand ready to share for the benefit of all mankind.
Whether we stand first in these endeavors matters to our momentary pride but not to our continuing and permanent purpose.
The race in which we of this generation are determined to be first is the race for peace in the world.
In the labors of peaceas in the explorations of spacelet no man in any land doubt for a moment that we have the will, and the determination, and the talent, and the resources required to stay the course and see those labors through.
So, I would end this week as I began it last Sunday morning, saying to all nations and all peoples, East and West, that we of Americaa strong, a confident, a proud, and a peaceful Americainvite you to open your curtains, come through the doorways and the walls that you have built, and join with us to walk together toward peace for all people on this earth.
Thank you.
Thank you, Colonel McDivitt, and thank you, Colonel White.
I just want to say this, before I look at your Center, that I conducted the first investigations in the space field as a Member of the Senate.
And as I looked out over this group today and this great installation that just did not exist those few years ago, I thought of what Jim Webb and  Dryden had said 4 years ago, or more, when they left my office the first day they were to undertake this assignment.
I saw  Seamans and  Gilruth here today and all of the thousands of people who have participated in this great adventure.
You do not know the gratitude I feel to each of you and how proud I am of all of you.
Thank you.
President,  Secretary General, Your Excellencies, distinguished representatives, Governor Brown, ladies and gentlemen: On my journey across the continent, I stopped in the State of Missouri, and there I met with the man who made the first such pilgrimage here 20 years ago as the 33d President of the United StatesHarry S.
Truman.
Truman sent to this Assembly his greetings and good wishes on this anniversary commemoration.
He asked that I express to you for himas for myself and for my countrymenthe faith which we of the United States hold firmly in the United Nations and in the ultimate success of its mission among men.
On this historic and happy occasion we have met to celebrate 20 years of achievement and to look together at the work that we face in future meetings.
I come to this anniversary not to speak of futility or failure nor of doubt and despairI come to raise a voice of confidence in both the future of these United Nations and the fate of the human race.
The movement of history is glacial.
On two decades of experience, none can presume to speak with certainty of the direction or the destiny of man's affairs.
But this we do know and this we do believe.
Futility and failure are not the truth of this organization brought into being here 20 years ago.
Where, historically, man has moved fitfully from war toward war, in these last two decades man has moved steadily away from war as either an instrument of national policy or a means of international decision.
Many factors have contributed to this change.
But no one single factor has contributed more than the existence and the enterprise of the United Nations itself.
For there can be no doubt that the United Nations has taken root in human need and has established a shape, and a purpose, and a meaning of its Own.
By providing a forum for the opinions of the world, the United Nations has given them a force and an influence that they have never had before.
By shining the light of inquiry and discussion upon very dark and isolated conflicts, it has pressed the nations of the world to conform their courses to the requirements of the United Nations Charter.
And let all rememberand none forget-that now more than 50 times in these an years the United Nations has acted to keep the peace.
By persuading nations to justify their own conduct before all countries, it has helped, at many times and in many places, to soften the harshness of man to his fellow man.
By confronting the rich with the misery of the poor and the privileged with the despair of the oppressed, it has removed the excuse of ignoranceunmasked the evil of indifference, and has placed an insistent, even though still unfulfilled, responsibility upon the more fortunate of the earth.
By insisting upon the political dignity of man, it has welcomed 63 nations to take their places alongside the 51 original membersa historical development of dramatic import, achieved mainly through peaceful means.
And by binding countries together in the great declarations of the charter, it has given those principles a strengthened vitality in the conduct of the affairs of man.
Today thenat this time of anniversary-let us not occupy ourselves with parochial doubts or with passing despair.
The United Nationsafter 20 yearsdoes not draw its life from the assembly hails or the committee rooms.
It lives in the conscience and the reason of mankind.
The most urgent problem we face is the keeping of the peace.
Today, as I speak, clear and present dangers in southeast Asia cast their shadow across the path of all mankind.
The United Nations must be concerned.
The most elementary principle of the United Nations is that neighbors must not attack their neighborsand that principle today is under challenge.
The processes of peaceful settlement today are blocked by willful aggressors contemptuous of the opinion and the will of mankind.
Bilateral diplomacy has yielded no result.
The machinery of the Geneva conference has been paralyzed.
Resort to the Security Council has been rejected.
The efforts of the distinguished Secretary General have been rebuffed.
An appeal for unconditional discussion was met with contempt.
A pause in bombing operations was called an insult.
The concern for peace of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers has received little and very disappointing results.
Therefore, today I put to this world assembly the facts of aggression, the right of a people to be free from attack, the interest of every member in safety against molestation, the duty of this organization to reduce the dangers to peace, and the unhesitating readiness of the United States of America to find a peaceful solution.
I now call upon this gathering of the nations of the world to use all their influence, individually and collectively, to bring to the tables those who seem determined to make war.
We will support your efforts, as we will support effective action by any agent or agency of these United Nations.
But the agenda of peace is not a single item.
Around the world there are many disputes that are filled with dangersmany tensions that are taut with peril,many arms races that are fraught with folly among small nations as well as large.
And the first purpose of the United Nations is peace-keeping.
The first work of all members now, then, just must be peacemaking.
For this organization exists to resolve quarrels outside the confines of its headquartersand not to prolong quarrels within.
Where there are disputes, let us try to find the means to resolve themthrough whatever machinery is available or is possible.
Where the United Nations requires readily available peace forces in hours and daysand not in weeks or monthslet all pledge to provide those forces.
And my country is ready.
On another front of our common endeavors, I think nothing is more urgent than the effort to diminish danger by bringing the armaments of the world under increasing control.
Nations rich and poor are burdened down by excessive and competitive and frightening arms.
So let us all urgently commit ourselves to the rational reduction of those arms burdens.
We of the United States would hope that others will join with us in coming to our next negotiations with proposals for effective attack upon these deadly dangers to mankind.
And after peace, high on the agenda of man is devotion to the dignity and to the worth of the human personand the promotions of better standards of life in larger freedom for all of the human race.
We in this country are committing ourselves to great tasks in our own Great Society.
We are committed to narrow the gap between promise and performance, between equality in law and equality in fact, between opportunity for the numerous well-to-do and the still too numerous poor, between education for the successful and education for all of the people.
It is no longer a community or a nation or a continent but a whole generation of mankind for whom our promises must be keptand kept within the next two decades.
If those promises are not kept, it will be less and less possible to keep them for any.
And that is whyon this anniversaryI would call upon all member nations to rededicate themselves to wage together an international war on poverty.
So let us then together:raise the goal for technical aid and investment through the United Nations.
increase our food, and health, and education programs to make a serious and a successful attack upon hunger, and disease, and ignorancethe ancient enemies of all mankind.
Let us in all our landsincluding this landface forthrightly the multiplying problems of our multiplying populations and seek the answers to this most profound challenge to the future of all the world.
Let us act on the fact that less than $5 invested in population control is worth $100 invested in economic growth.
For our wars together on the poverty and privation, the hunger and sickness, the despair and the futility of mankind, let us mark this International Cooperation Year by joining together in an alliance for man.
The promise of the future lies in what science, the ever more productive industrial machine, the ever more productive fertile and usable land, the computer, the miracle drug, and the man in space all spread before us.
The promise of the future lies in what the religions and the philosophies, the cultures, and the wisdoms of 5,000 years of civilization have finally distilled and confided to usthe promise of the abundant life and the brotherhood of man.
The heritage that we share together is a fragile heritage.
A world war would certainly destroy it.
Pride and arrogance could destroy it.
Neglect and indifference could destroy it.
It could be destroyed by narrow nationalism or ideological intoleranceor rabid extremism of either the left or the right.
So we must find the way as a community of nations, as a United Nations, to keep the peace among and between all of us.
We must restrain by joint and effective action any who place their ambitions or their dogmas or their prestige above the peace of all the world.
And we just must find a way to do that.
It is the most profound and the most urgent imperative of the time in which we live.
So I say to you as my personal belief, and the belief I think of the great American majority, that the world must finish once and for all the myth of inequality of races and peoples, with the scandal of discrimination, with the shocking violation of human rights and the cynical violation of political rights.
We must stop preaching hatred, we must stop bringing up entire new generations to preserve and to carry out the lethal fantasies of the old generation, stop believing that the gun or the bomb can solve all problems or that a revolution is of any value if it closes doors and limits choices instead of opening both as wide as possible.
As far back as we can lookuntil the light of history fades into the dusk of legend-such aspirations of man have been submerged and swallowed by the violence and the weakness of man at his worst.
Generations have come and gone, and generations have tried and failed.
Will we succeed?I do not know.
But I dare to be hopeful and confident.
And I do know this: whether we look for the judgment to God, or to history or to mankind, this is the age, and we are the men, and this is the place to give reality to our commitments under the United Nations Charter.
For what was for other generations just a hope is for this generation a simple necessity.
Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge will be leaving tomorrow evening for Saigon.
When they return next week, we will give careful consideration to their recommendations, as well as those of Ambassador Taylor and General Westmoreland.
And we will do what is necessary.
The present center of the struggle is in South Viet-Nam, but its root cause is a determined effort of conquest that is directed from Hanoi.
Heavy infiltration of North Vietnamese forces has created new dangers and difficulties in South Viet-Nam.
Increased aggression from the North may require an increased American response on the ground in South Viet-Nam.
Increased aggression from the North continues to require very careful replies against selected military targets in North Viet-Nam.
Meanwhile, General Westmoreland has the authority to use the American forces that are now in Viet-Nam in the ways which he considers most effective to resist the Communist aggression and the terror that is taking.
place there.
These forces will defend their own bases.
They will assist in providing security in neighboring areas, and they will be available for more active combat missions when the Vietnamese Government and General Westmoreland agree that such active missions are needed.
So it is quite possible that new and serious decisions will be necessary in the near future.
Any substantial increase in the present level of our efforts to turn back the aggressors in South Viet-Nam will require steps to insure that our reserves of men and equipment of the United States remain entirely adequate for any and all emergencies.
Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge will concern themselves also with the political and economic situation.
We have had  Eugene Black visiting southeast Asia and he has given me an oral report on his encouraging visit to that area.
We mean to make it plain that our military effort is only a necessary preliminary to the larger purpose of peace and progress.
In the Dominican Republic, Ambassador Bunker and his colleagues are continuing their skillful and determined effort to find a peaceful solution.
We believe, as they do, that it is urgent that a solution bc found, and found promptly.
We are encouraged by indications that leaders on both sides are prepared to stand aside in favor of a new government which will enjoy the confidence of the Dominican people as a whole.
Those on both sides who show good will and those who join a new government in the work of restoring peace will deserve the thanks of all of their countrymen.
Right now, here, we are both cautious and hopeful.
I am very pleased to announce today that I am nominating Judge Thurgood Marshall to be Solicitor General of the United States.
He will succeed the Honorable Archibald Cox, who is retiring after more than four years of distinguished service to return to Massachusetts.
The Solicitor General directs all Government litigation before the Supreme Court of the United States and the other appellate courts.
Judge Marshall brings to that significant job an outstanding record of legal and judicial experience.
He has served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit since 1962, and at very considerable financial sacrifice is resigning in order to meet the needs of his Government.
For a quarter of a century before his appointment to the bench, Judge Marshall was the leading legal champion of equal rights under the law, appearing before the Supreme Court more than 30 times.
His vast experience in the Federal courts, and especially in the Supreme Court, has gained Judge Marshall a reputation as one of the most distinguished advocates in the Nation.
I know him to be a lawyer and a judge of very high ability, a patriot of deep convictions, and a gentleman of undisputed integrity.
So it is an honor to appoint him as the 33d Solicitor General of the United States.
He is here this afternoon and I would like to ask him to stand.
Judge Marshall.
I intend to nominate  Leonard Marks of Washington, D.
C.
, to be the Director of the United States Information Service, succeeding the Honorable Carl Rowan.
Marks has an excellent record as a teacher, as a lawyer, and as a Government servant.
President Kennedy appointed him to be an original member of the board of directors of the Communications Satellite Corporation in 1962.
Since that time he has been reappointed.
Marks, who has had a long interest in international communications, has represented the United States at broadcasting conferences and activities in Italy, India, Pakistan, Switzerland, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Iran.
Phillips Talbot, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, will be nominated as United States Ambassador to Greece.
He will succeed  Henry R.
Labouisse, who is Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund.
A most experienced Foreign Service Officer, the Honorable Raymond A.
Hare, who is presently Ambassador to Turkey, will succeed him in his post as Assistant Secretary of State.
Ambassador Hare has been in the Foreign Service since 1927.
He has served in France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United Arab Republic, and Yemen.
I have asked  Penelope Hartland Thunberg of Maryland to become a member of the United States Tariff Commission.
She will serve in the position last held by Commissioner Walter Schreiber for a term expiring June 16, 1970.
Thunberg is an international economist presently serving as Deputy Chief of the International Division, Economic and Research Area, Central Intelligence Agency.
She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Pembroke College and holds the M.
A.
and Ph.
D.
degrees from Radcliffe College.
She is here this afternoon and I would like for you to meet her.
Please stand up.
Yesterday the Soviet Government notified the United States Government that it is agreeable to the resumption of negotiations of the 18-nation Disarmament Committee at Geneva.
The United States has suggested a date no later than July 27th for this resumption.
William C.
Foster now is in the process of inquiring whether this date is agreeable to the other 16 members of the Disarmament Committee.
At the conclusion of the Geneva conference last September, it was agreed that the two cochairmen, the Soviet Union and the United States, would consult and would agree on a date for resumption, after which the other members of the Committee would be consulted in order to obtain their agreement as well.
Foster met with the Soviet spokesman in New York on June 15th on instructions to urge reconvening of the Disarmament Committee as soon as possible.
Yesterday's Soviet response is an encouraging development.
As we have stated before, peace is the leading item on the agenda of mankind, and every effort should be made to lead us toward that goal.
As I stated in San Francisco, we will come to these next negotiations with proposals for effective attack on these deadly dangers to mankind, and we hope that others will do the same.
Now I am prepared to take your questions.
The Government is always considering every possibility and every eventuality.
No decisions have been made in connection with the Reserve or increasing draft calls.
We will be in a better position to act upon matters of that kind after the Secretary returns from his trip.
I think that the Governor has best explained that trip himself by saying it is a vacation.
That is on the wires today.
It is not an official Government trip.
He was not sent there by the President, although the Governor is a man of a wide range of interests and experience.
I approved heartily of his statement that he would be glad to visit with any people that cared to visit with him.
It is a personal trip, and a vacation trip in nature.
I do not think that anyone can prophesy what will happen from day to day, or week to week, or month to month.
I think it is well for us to remember that three Presidents have made the pledge for this Nation, that the Senate has ratified the SEATO treaty by a vote of 82 to I, pledging the United States to come to the aid of any nation, upon their request, who are parties to that treaty or protocol.
President Eisenhower made our first commitment there in 1954.
That was reaffirmed by President Kennedy many times in different ways.
The present President has reiterated the stand of the United States that we expect to keep that commitment.
Our national honor is at stake.
Our word is at stake.
And it must be obvious to all Americans that they would not want the President of their country to follow any course that was inconsistent with our commitments or with our national honor.
So far as I am aware, the situation there has no effect on the merger one way or the other.
It is contended that the merger would improve the efficiency, but I do not think that it is a matter that would be considered in connection with what happens out there, one way or the other.
No, I am not in a position to make a statement on that at this time.
The Space Council has had some briefings in connection with the matter.
There is a study going on every day in that connection, but I would not want to go further than that now.
We are very anxious to maintain close relations with the Soviet Union, and we had felt that considerable progress had been made in the last several years.
Unfortunately, the situation that developed in North Viet-Nam has placed a strain on those relations.
We regret it very deeply, but we have felt that, as I said earlier, our national honor required us to pursue the course of conduct that we have followed.
We will be looking for every opportunity that we can to work with the Soviet Union in the interest of peace.
We think that the resumption of the Disarmament Conference is one step in that direction.
We would like to improve the relations any way we can.
As I said in my opening statement, the aggression has increased.
The forces that are pursuing that aggression have greatly increased in number.
It will be necessary to resist that aggression and, therefore, to have substantially larger increments of troops which we have been supplying from time to time.
I do not think that anyone can tell at this date any special figure that will be required, but I think that following Ambassador Lodge and Secretary McNamara's trip we will have a better estimate of what the rest of the year will hold for us.
We would hope that if the North Vietnamese would cease their aggression we could immediately take steps to have the people of South Viet-Nam exercise their choice and establish a government of their choosing.
We, of course, would hope that that would be a very efficient and effective and democratic system.
Yes, we will constantly be on the alert to probe, and to be ready and willing to negotiate with the appropriate people.
I must say that candor compels me to tell you that there has not been the slightest indication that the other side is interested in negotiation or in unconditional discussions, although the United States has made some dozen separate attempts to bring that about.
I think that the press and the Congress and the people of the United States have, generally speaking, with very minor exceptions, given me during the time I have been President very strong support and very excellent cooperation.
I know that there are some in each segment that have been disappointed in some of my decisions and some of my actions.
I like to think that those who talk about them the most see us the least, and so far as I am concerned, I have no criticism to make of any other people in helping me do my job.
We have a very fine Cabinet.
Nearly every person I have asked to come and help the Government has done so.
I think that there are very few Presidents in the history of this country that have had more support of more publishers and more magazines than the present President.
I am grateful for that, although I recognize it is an essential 'part of their duty to point up weaknesses that they think exist.
I have seen that take place for some 35 years, and as long as they point them out, in the manner in which they are pointing them out, and the people continue to support us, and the Congress continues to support us, I am not going to find any fault with them.
During the period that we have had the most hectic, distressing moments here in Washington, the poll has gone up 6 percent out in the country, so I sometimes think maybe it just may be July in the Nation's Capital.
Yes, I have taken a position since making my recommendations to the Congress early in the year, that I would like to see the poll tax repealed.
I am against the poll tax.
I have tried to get it repealed every time that I have had a chance, when I thought we could do it legally.
I have asked the Attorney General to attempt to work with the conferees of both House and Senate to see if they cannot agree on satisfactory language that will give us the most effective repeal provision that is obtainable and that we think can be supported in the courts.
I have no doubt but what a very satisfactory solution will be found.
And I think that would be quite desirable.
No.
The Deputy Director is now being handled by a very able man with experience who will be there for a while yet.
I am sure that after  Marks reviews the organizations and talks to the present Deputy Director and the present Director,  Rowan, he will come up with some suggestions and recommendations.
I believe that they will be acceptable.
I did not single out anyone.
We had had several days' debate about the relative merits of two proposals.
It had been observed that the administration proposal was dripping in venom and was inadequate and went too far, and a good many things had been said about it.
Finally, when it was put as a test to the judgment of the House and they made their decision, I commended that decision and said that I believed that they were wise in acting as they had.
Because had they adopted the so-called Ford or McCulloch substitute for the committee bill, as advocated by Judge Howard Smith and Governor Tuck and others, I was of the opinion it would have diluted and taken strength from the bill that they had passed.
I am very proud of the action of the House.
I am very proud of the judgment they exercised in that connection.
But people are allowed to comment on the relative merits of legislation either before or after a vote, and I found there have been a good many comments on my proposals.
I thought it would be appropriate if I carefully limited myself to an observation that the substitute would have diluted the right of every American to vote.
I think all of us are aware of the fact that in years gone by we could have done much more than we have in that field.
I have become very conscious of that as I have traveled over this Nation and talked to our people.
I think the House acted wisely, and I have every confidence in the action that will follow the conference report.
I ask the cooperation of members of both parties.
I do not think the substitute was as effective as the bill that was adopted.
And I would not like to see us return to it.
Yes, I think that all of us realize at this stage of the 20th century there is much that should have been done that has not been done.
This bill is not going to solve the problem completely itself.
There will be much to be done in the years ahead.
I think the problem of the American Negro is one of the two or three most important problems that we must face up to with our legislation again next year.
I am particularly sensitive to the problems of the Negro and the problems of the city and the problems which the shift in population has caused, the problems of education.
I have task forces working on those things.
And perhaps it is because I realize, after traveling through 44 States and after reading some 20,000 or 30,000 letters a week, digests from them, that it is a very acute problem and one that I want to do my best to solve in the.
limited time that I am allowed.
I did not have that responsibility in the years past, and I did not feel it to the extent that I do today.
I hope that you may understand that I think it is an acute one and a dangerous one, and one that occupies high priority and one that should challenge every American of whatever party, whatever religion.
I am going to try to provide all the leadership that I can, notwithstanding the fact that someone may point to a mistake or 100 mistakes that I made in my past.
Peter, I do not think that we can tell the extent of that agreement and how far it will reach.
They gave no figures.
They did not explain what materials they were going to supply.
We have known for some time now that they are furnishing equipment and they are furnishing supplies and they are making contributions of aid in one form or the other to North Viet-Nam; this is no surprise to us at all.
I read the very general announcement that they had made.
There is nothing that I could detect from it, or that our experts could detect, that would give me any more information than contained in the announcement.
No, I do not think that the teach-ins and the differences of opinion have increased the strength of the North Vietnamese or the aggression that has taken place.
I do think that at times our allies, particularly the South Vietnamese people, and particularly our own soldiers, do get concerned about how strong we are behind them and how united we are in this very serious undertaking.
But I am glad to say that I do not think it has had any serious or damaging effect there.
I get several letters a day from soldiers in Viet-Nam, service people, the Navy, Marines, Army, and Air.
I hear from their parents.
And I have yet to receive a single complaining letter.
On occasions they wish that the folks back home, who are following this with such dedicated interest, understood the position as they feel they understand it.
But I do not think it has damaged our effort out there and I do not think it will.
I think we will be united in this effort.
There will be some differences of opinion about the wisdom of some courses that the President takes, the Executive takes, but whenever and wherever we can, we will try to explain those to the people involved and at least try to get their understanding.
None whatever.
And I think you do a great damage and a great disservice to one of the most able and most competent and most dedicated men that I have ever known, Secretary Rusk.
He sits to my right in the Cabinet room.
He ranks first in the Cabinet and he ranks first with me.
I would not want to get into a dispute with my friends who have written these memorandums.
I do not see anything to be gained by that.
The President asked me, on his own motion, to go on the ticket with him, and I gave him my reasons for hesitating.
He told me he would speak to Speaker Rayburn and others, and he did.
Subsequently, he called me and said, Here's a statement I am going to read on television, unless you have an objection.
I listened to it.
After I heard it, I felt that I should do what I did.
I do not know just how much these men may know about what actually happened, but they are entitled to their opinions.
Of course, I know why I did what I did.
Thank you,  President.
My fellow Americans: Not long ago I received a letter from a woman in the Midwest.
She wrote:Dear  President:In my humble way I am writing 'to you about the crisis in Viet-Nam.
I have a son who is now in Viet-Nam.
My husband served in World War II Our country was at war, but now, this time, it is just something that I do not understand.
Why?Well, I have tried to answer that question dozens of times and more in practically every State in this Union.
I have discussed it fully in Baltimore in April, in Washington in May, in San Francisco in June.
Let me again, now, discuss it here in the East Room of the White House.
Why must young Americans, born into a land exultant with hope and with golden promise, toil and suffer and sometimes die in such a remote and distant place?The answer, like the war itself, is not an easy one, but it echoes clearly from the painful lessons of half a century.
Three times in my lifetime, in two World Wars and in Korea, Americans have gone to far lands to fight for freedom.
We have learned at a terrible and a brutal cost that retreat does not bring safety and weakness does not bring peaceIt is this lesson that has brought us to Viet-Nam.
This is a different kind of war.
There are no marching armies or solemn declarations.
Some citizens of South Viet-Nam at times, with understandable grievances, have joined in the attack on their own government.
But we must not let this mask the central fact that this is really war.
It is guided by North Viet-Nam and it is spurred by Communist China.
Its goal is to conquer the South, to defeat American power, and to extend the Asiatic dominion of communism.
There are great stakes in the balance.
Most of the non-Communist nations of Asia cannot, by themselves and alone, resist the growing might and the grasping ambition of Asian communism.
Our power, therefore, is a very vital shield.
If we are driven from the field in Viet-Nam, then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in American promise, or in American protection.
In each land the forces of independence would be considerably weakened, and an Asia so threatened by Communist domination would certainly imperil the security of the United States itself.
We did not choose to be the guardians at the gate, but there is no one else.
Nor would surrender in Viet-Nam bring peace, because we learned from Hitler at Munich that success only feeds the appetite of aggression.
The battle would be renewed in one country and then another country, bringing with it perhaps even larger and crueler conflict, as we have learned from the lessons of history.
Moreover, we are in Viet-Nam to fulfill one of the most solemn pledges of the American Nation.
Three PresidentsPresident Eisenhower, President Kennedy, and your present Presidentover 11 years have committed themselves and have promised to help defend this small and valiant nation.
Strengthened by that promise, the people of South Viet-Nam have fought for many long years.
Thousands of them have died.
Thousands more have been crippled and scarred by war.
We just cannot now dishonor our word, or abandon our commitment, or leave those who believed us and who trusted us to the terror and repression and murder that would follow.
This, then, my fellow Americans, is why we are in Viet-Nam.
My fellow Americans: Once again in man's age-old struggle for a better life and a world of peace, the wisdom, courage, and compassion of the American people are being put to the test.
This is the meaning of the tragic conflict in Vietnam.
In meeting the present challenge, it is essential that our people seek understanding, and that our leaders speak with candor.
I have therefore directed that this report to the American people be compiled and widely distributed.
In its pages you will find statements on Vietnam by three leaders of your Governmentby your President, your Secretary of State, and your Secretary of Defense.
These statements were prepared for different audiences, and they reflect the differing responsibilities of each speaker.
The congressional testimony has been edited to avoid undue repetition and to incorporate the sense of the discussions that ensued.
Together, they construct a clear definition of America's role in the Vietnam conflict:the dangers and hopes that Vietnam holds for all free menthe fullness and limits of our national objectives in a war we did not seekthe constant effort on our part to bring this war we do not desire to a quick and honorable end.
What are our goals in that war-strained land?First, we intend to convince the Communists that we cannot be defeated by force of arms or by superior power.
They are not easily convinced.
In recent months they have greatly increased their fighting forces and their attacks and the number of incidents.
I have asked the Commanding General, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression.
He has told me.
We will meet his needs.
I have today ordered to Viet-Nam the Air Mobile Division and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength from 75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately.
Additional forces will be needed later, and they will be sent as requested.
This will make it necessary to increase our active fighting forces by raising the monthly draft call from 17,000 over a period of time to 35,000 per month, and for us to step up our campaign for voluntary enlistments.
After this past week of deliberations, I have concluded that it is not essential to order Reserve units into service now.
If that necessity should later be indicated, I will give the matter most careful consideration and I will give the countryyouan adequate notice before taking such action, but only after full preparations.
We have also discussed with the Government of South Viet-Nam lately, the steps that we will take to substantially increase their own effort, both on the battlefield and toward reform and progress in the villages.
Ambassador Lodge is now formulating a new program to be tested upon his return to that area.
I have directed Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara to be available immediately to the Congress to review with these committees, the appropriate congressional committees, what we plan to do in these areas.
I have asked them to be able to answer the questions of any Member of Congress.
Secretary McNamara, in addition, will ask the Senate Appropriations Committee to add a limited amount to present legislation to help meet part of this new cost until a supplemental measure is ready and hearings can be held when the Congress assembles in January.
In the meantime, we will use the authority contained in the present Defense appropriation bill under consideration to transfer funds in addition to the additional money that we will ask.
These steps, like our actions in the past, are carefully measured to do what must be done to bring an end to aggression and a peaceful settlement.
We do not want an expanding struggle with consequences that no one can perceive, nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt our power, but we will not surrender and we will not retreat.
For behind our American pledge lies the determination and resources, I believe, of all of the American Nation.
Second, once the Communists know, as we know, that a violent solution is impossible, then a peaceful solution is inevitable.
We are ready now, as we have always been, to move from the battlefield to the conference table.
I have stated publicly and many times, again and again, America's willingness to begin unconditional discussions with any government, at any place, at any time.
Fifteen efforts have been made to start these discussions with the help of 40 nations throughout the world, but there has been no answer.
But we are going to continue to persist, if persist we must, until death and desolation have led to the same conference table where others could now join us at a much smaller cost.
I have spoken many times of our objectives in Viet-Nam.
So has the Government of South Viet-Nam.
Hanoi has set forth its own proposals.
We are ready to discuss their proposals and our proposals and any proposals of any government whose people may be affected, for we fear the meeting room no more than we fear the battlefield.
In this pursuit we welcome and we ask for the concern and the assistance of any nation and all nations.
If the United Nations and its officials or any one of its 114 members can by deed or word, private initiative or public action, bring us nearer an honorable peace, then they will have the support and the gratitude of the United States of America.
I have directed Ambassador Goldberg to go to New York today and to present immediately to Secretary General U Thant a letter from me requesting that all the resources, energy, and immense prestige of the United Nations be employed to find ways to halt aggression and to bring peace in Viet-Nam.
I made a similar request at San Francisco a few weeks ago, because we do not seek the destruction of any government, nor do we covet a foot of any territory.
But we insist and we will always insist that the people of South Viet-Nam shall have the right of choice, the right to shape their own destiny in free elections in the South or throughout all Viet-Nam under international supervision, and they shall not have any government imposed upon them by force and terror so long as we can prevent it.
This was the purpose of the 1954 agreements which the Communists have now cruelly shattered.
If the machinery of those agreements was tragically weak, its purposes still guide our action.
As battle rages, we will continue as best we can to help the good people of South Viet-Nam enrich the condition of their life, to feed the hungry and to tend the sick, and teach the young, and shelter the homeless, and to help the farmer to increase his crops, and the worker to find a job.
It is an ancient but still terrible irony that while many leaders of men create division in pursuit of grand ambitions, the children of man are really united in the simple, elusive desire for a life of fruitful and rewarding toil.
As I said at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, I hope that one day we can help all the people of Asia toward that desire.
Eugene Black has made great progress since my appearance in Baltimore in that direction-not as the price of peace, for we are ready always to bear a more painful cost, but rather as a part of our obligations of justice toward our fellow man.
Let me also add now a personal note.
I do not find it easy to send the flower of our youth, our finest young men, into battle.
I have spoken to you today of the divisions and the forces and the battalions and the units, but I know them all, every one.
I have seen them in a thousand streets, of a hundred towns, in every State in this Unionworking and laughing and building, and filled with hope and life.
I think I know, too, how their mothers weep and how their families sorrow.
This is the most agonizing and the most painful duty of your President.
There is something else, too.
When I was young, poverty was so common that we did not know it had a name.
An education was something that you had to fight for, and water was really life itself.
I have now been in public life 35 years, more than three decades, and in each of those 35 years I have seen good men, and wise leaders, struggle to bring the blessings of this land to all of our people.
And now I am the President.
It is now my opportunity to help every child get an education, to help every Negro and every American citizen have an equal opportunity, to have every family get a decent home, and to help bring healing to the sick and dignity to the old.
As I have said before, that is what I have lived for, that is what I have wanted all my life since I was a little boy, and I do not want to see all those hopes and all those dreams of so many people for so many years now drowned in the wasteful ravages of cruel wars.
I am going to do all I can do to see that that never happens.
But I also know, as a realistic public servant, that as long as there are men who hate and destroy, we must have the courage to resist, or we will see it all, all that we have built, all that we hope to build, all of our dreams for freedomall, all will be swept away on the flood of conquest.
So, too, this shall not happen.
We will stand in Viet-Nam.
Now, what America is, and was, and hopes to stand for as an important national asset, telling the truth to this world, telling an exciting story, is the Voice of America.
I classify this assignment in the front rank of importance to the freedom of the world, and that is why today I am proud to announce to you the name of the man who will direct the Voice of America.
He is a man whose voice and whose face and whose mind is known to this country and to most of the entire world.
His name is John Chancellor.
Chancellor was born 38 years ago in Chicago.
For more than 15 years he has been with the news department of the National Broadcasting Company.
During that time he has covered the worldin Vienna, London, Moscow, New York, Brussels, Berlin, and Washington.
Since 1964 he has been with you, one of the White House correspondents.
This, I think, is the first time in the history of the Voice of America that a working newspaperman, a respected commentator, an experienced, independent reporter, has been given the responsibility of leadership and direction in this vital enterprise.
I think he understands the challenges that are present and the achievements that are possible.
I am satisfied that the Voice of America will be in imaginative, competent, reliable, and always truthful hands.
Stand up, John, will you please?The President has few responsibilities of greater importance or greater consequence to the country's future than the constitutional responsibility of nominating Justices for the Supreme Court of the United States.
I am happy today, here in the East Room, to announce that the distinguished American who was my first choice for the position now vacant on the Supreme Court, has agreed to accept this call to this vital duty.
I will very shortly, this afternoon, send to the United States Senate my nomination of the Honorable Abe Fortas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
For many, many years, I have regarded  Fortas as one of this Nation's most able and most respected and most outstanding citizens, a scholar, a profound thinker, a lawyer of superior ability, and a man of humane and deeply compassionate feelings toward his fellow mana champion of our liberties.
That opinion is shared by the legal profession and by the bar of this country, by Members of the Congress and by the leaders of business and labor, and other sectors of our national life.
Fortas has, as you know, told me on numerous occasions in the last 20 months, that he would not be an applicant or a candidate, or would not accept any appointment to any public office.
This is, I guess, as it should be, for in this instance the job has sought the man.
Fortas agrees that the duty and the opportunity of service on the highest court of this great country, is not a call that any citizen can reject.
So I am proud for the country that he has, this morning, accepted this appointment and will serve his country as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
I will be glad to take your questions now for a period.
I do not want to speculate on the reactions of other people.
This Nation is prepared, and will always be prepared, to protect its national interest.
Yes, I think the American people ought to understand that there is no quick solution to the problem that we face there.
I would not want to prophesy or predict whether it would be a matter of months or years or decades.
I do not know that we had any accurate timetable on how long it would take to bring victory in World War I.
I do not think anyone really knew whether it would be 2 years or 4 years or 6 years, to meet with success in World War II I do think our cause is just.
I do think our purposes and objectives are beyond any question.
I do believe that America will stand united behind her men that are there.
I plan, as long as I am President, to see that our forces are strong enough to protect our national interest, our right hand constantly protecting that interest with our military, and that our diplomatic and political negotiations are constantly attempting to find some solution that would substitute words for bombs.
As I have said so many times, if anyone questions our good faith and will ask us to meet them to try to reason this matter out, they will find us at the appointed place, at the appointed time, in the proper chair.
We are always hopeful that every effort in that direction will meet with success.
We welcome those efforts as we welcomed the Commonwealth proposal, as we welcomed  Davies' visit, as we welcomed the Indian suggestion, as we have welcomed the efforts of the distinguished Prime Minister of Great Britain and others from time to time.
As I just said, I hope that every member of the United Nations that has any idea, any plan, any program, any suggestion, that they will not let them go unexplored.
I have not the slightest doubt but whatever it is necessary to face, the American people will face.
I think that all of us know that we are now in the 5 ad month of the prosperity that has been unequaled in this Nation, and I see no reason for declaring a national emergency and I rejected that course of action earlier today when I made my decision.
I cannot foresee what next year, or the following year, or the following year will hold.
I only know that the Americans will do whatever is necessary.
At the moment we enjoy the good fortune of having an unparalleled period of prosperity with us, and this Government is going to do all it can to see it continue.
No, we have no information as to how they were manned.
We cannot speak with any authority on that matter.
We made the decision that we felt our national interests required, and as those problems present themselves we will face up to them.
We have communicated with most of the friendly nations of the world in the last few days and we have received from them responses that have been encouraging.
I would not want to go into any individual response here, but I would say that I have indicated to all of the friendly nations what our problems were there, the decision that confronted us, and asked for their help and for their suggestions.
We would hope very much that it could and we will do nothing to provoke that confrontation if we can avoid it.
As you know, immediately after I assumed the Presidency I immediately sent messages to the Soviet Union.
We have had frequent exchange of views by letter and by conversation with  Gromyko and  Dobrynin.
We are doing nothing to provoke the Soviet Union.
We are very happy that they agreed to resume the disarmament conference.
I went to some length to try to extend ourselves to make the proposals that I would hope would meet with acceptance of the peoples of the world.
We would like to believe that there could be some success flow from this conference although we have not been too successful.
I know of nothing that we have in mind that should arouse the distrust or provoke any violence on the part of the Soviet Union.
It does not imply any change in policy whatever.
It does not imply any change of objective.
I have made very clear in my San Francisco speech my hope that the Secretary General, under his wise leadership, would explore every possibility that might lead to a solution of this matter.
In my letter to the Secretary General this morning, which Ambassador Goldberg will deliver later in the day, I reiterate my hopes and my desires and I urge upon him that heif he agreesthat he undertake new efforts in this direction.
Ambassador Goldberg understands the challenge.
We spent the weekend talking about the potentialities and the possibilities, our hopes and our dreams, and I believe that we will have an able advocate and a searching negotiator who, I would hope, would some day find success.
I do not know.
That would depend on the circumstances.
I cannot pinpoint the date on the calendar, or the hour of the day.
I have to ask Congress for their judgments and for their decisions almost every hour of the day.
One of the principal duties of the Office of President is to maintain constant consultation.
I have talked to, I guess, more than 50 Members of Congress in the last 24 hours.
I have submitted myself to their questions, and the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense will meet with them tomorrow if they are ready, to answer any questions that they may need.
Up to now, we have had ample authority, excellent cooperation, a united Congress behind us, andas near as I could tell from my meetings last night with the leaders, and from my meetings today with the distinguished chairmen of the committees and the members of both partieswe all met as Americans, united and determined to stand as one.
Yes.
I do not interpret it that way.
I think that there are dangers in escalation.
I do not think I have any right to commit the whole world to world war III I am doing everything I know how to avoid it.
But retreat is not necessarily the best way to avoid it.
I have outlined to you what I think is the best policy.
I would hope that Governor Hatfield and the other Governors, when they understand what we are doing, and when I have a chance to submit myself to their questioning and to counsel with them, would share my view.
I know they have the same concern for the American people and the people of the world as I do.
I do not believe our objectives will be very different.
As a matter of fact, I asked the Governors if they could, to come here at the conclusion of their deliberations.
I will have my plane go to Minneapolis tomorrow, and I believe 43 of the 48 have indicated a desire to come here.
I will give them all the information I canconfidential, secret, and otherwise-because I have great respect for them, their judgments, their opinions, and their leadership.
It is going to be necessary in this effort.
I will also have the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense review with them all their plans, and answer any of their inquiries, and we hope resolve any doubts they might have.
Well, I do not agree with that.
I do not guess there is anyone in this country that has as much understanding and as much help, and as many experts, and as good advice, and many people of both parties trying to help them, as they are me.
Of course I admit I need it more than anybody else.
Nancy, I have not been lonely the last few daysI have had lots of callers.
We have stated time and time again that we would negotiate with any government, any place, any time.
The Viet Cong would have no difficulty in being represented and having their views presented if Hanoi for a moment decides she wants to cease aggression.
And I would not think that would be an insurmountable problem at all.
I think that could be worked out.
No, not at all.
My appointment of  Gardner suggests that I looked over America to find the very best man I could to lead us forward to become an educated nation where every child obtains all the education that he can take, and where the health of every citizen is his prime concern, and where the Social Security system is brought to the needs of the 20th century.
After canvassing some 40 or 50 possibilities, I concluded that  Gardner was the best man I could get.
I asked his board to relieve him of his duties and release him to the Government so that he could furnish the dynamic leadership officially that he has been furnishing unofficially to us.
He told me yesterday morning that he was prepared to do that.
I remembered that I had not asked him what State he lived in, where his permanent residence was, so I could put it on the nomination paper, or what party he belonged to.
And he rather-well, maybe somewhat hesitantly said, I am a RepublicanI do not mean that his hesitating meant any particular significance, but I was happy that he said that because a good many Republicans voted for me and I do not want to be partial or partisan in this administration.
I like to see leadership of that kind come from the Republican ranks.
So I told him if he had no objections, I would announce very promptly his appointment and I hoped that he would give us American leadership without regard to party.
And that is what I think he will do.
I believe all the Nation will be proud of him as we are of Secretary Celebrezze.
Thank you,  President.
Vice President,  Speaker, Members of Congress, members of the Cabinet, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:Today is a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield.
Yet to seize the meaning of this day, we must recall darker times.
Three and a half centuries ago the first Negroes arrived at Jamestown.
They did not arrive in brave ships in search of a home for freedom.
They did not mingle fear and joy, in expectation that in this New World anything would be possible to a man strong enough to reach for it.
They came in darkness and they came in chains.
And today we strike away the last major shackle of those fierce and ancient bonds.
Today the Negro story and the American story fuse and blend.
And let us remember that it was not always so.
The stories of our Nation and of the American Negro are like two great rivers.
Welling up from that tiny Jamestown spring they flow through the centuries along divided channels.
When pioneers subdued a continent to the need of man, they did not tame it for the Negro.
When the Liberty Bell rang out in Philadelphia, it did not toll for the Negro.
When Andrew Jackson threw open the doors of democracy, they did not open for the Negro.
It was only at Appomattox, a century ago, that an American victory was also a Negro victory.
And the two rivers  one shining with promise, the other dark-stained with oppression  began to move toward one another.
Yet, for almost a century the promise of that day was not fulfilled.
Today is a towering and certain mark that, in this generation, that promise will be kept.
In our time the two currents will finally mingle and rush as one great stream across the uncertain and the marvelous years of the America that is yet to come.
This act flows from a clear and simple wrong.
Its only purpose is to right that wrong.
Millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color.
This law will ensure them the right to vote.
The wrong is one which no American, in his heart, can justify.
The right is one which no American, true to our principles, can deny.
In 1957, as the leader of the majority in the United States Senate, speaking in support of legislation to guarantee the right of all men to vote, I said, This right to vote is the basic right without which all others are meaningless.
It gives people, people as individuals, control over their own destinies.
Last year I said, Until every qualified person regardless of.
the color of his skin has the right, unquestioned and unrestrained, to go in and cast his ballot in every precinct in this great land of ours, I am not going to be satisfied.
Immediately after the election I directed the Attorney General to explore, as rapidly as possible, the ways to ensure the right to vote.
And then last March, with the outrage of Selma still fresh, I came down to this Capitol one evening and asked the Congress and the people for swift and for sweeping action to guarantee to every man and woman the right to vote.
In less than 48 hours I sent the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Congress.
In little more than 4 months the Congress, with overwhelming majorities, enacted one of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American freedom.
The Members of the Congress, and the many private citizens, who worked to shape and pass this bill will share a place of honor in our history for this one act alone.
There were those who said this is an old injustice, and there is no need to hurry.
But 95 years have passed since the 15th amendment gave all Negroes the right to vote.
And the time for waiting is gone.
There were those who said smaller and more gradual measures should be tried.
But they had been tried.
For years and years they had been tried, and tried, and tried, and they had failed, and failed, and failed.
And the time for failure is gone.
There were those who said that this is a many-sided and very complex problem.
But however viewed, the denial of the right to vote is still a deadly wrong.
And the time for injustice has gone.
This law covers many pages.
But the heart of the act is plain.
Wherever, by clear and objective standards, states and counties are using regulations, or laws, or tests to deny the right to vote, then they will be struck down.
If it is clear that State officials still intend to discriminate, then Federal examiners will be sent in to register all eligible voters.
When the prospect of discrimination is gone, the examiners will be immediately withdrawn.
And, under this act, if any county anywhere in this Nation does not want Federal intervention it need only open its polling places to all of its people.
This good Congress, the 89th Congress, acted swiftly in passing this act.
I intend to act with equal dispatch in enforcing this act.
And tomorrow at 1 p.
m.
, the Attorney General has been directed to file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the poll tax in the State of Mississippi.
This will begin the legal process which, I confidently believe, will very soon prohibit any State from requiring the payment of money in order to exercise the fight to vote.
And also by tomorrow the Justice Department, through publication in the Federal Register, will have officially certified the States where discrimination exists.
I have, in addition, requested the Department of Justice to work all through this weekend so that on Monday morning next, they can designate many counties where past experience clearly shows that Federal action is necessary and required.
And by Tuesday morning, trained Federal examiners will be at work registering eligible men and women in 10 to 15 counties.
And on that same day, next Tuesday, additional poll tax suits will be filed in the States of Texas, Alabama, and Virginia.
And I pledge you that we will not delay, or we will not hesitate, or we will not turn aside until Americans of every race and color and origin in this country have the same right as all others to share in the process of democracy.
So, through this act, and its enforcement, an important instrument of freedom passes into the hands of millions of our citizens.
But that instrument must be used.
Presidents and Congresses, laws and lawsuits can open the doors to the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot.
But only the individual Negro, and all others who have been denied the right to vote, can really walk through those doors, and can use that right, and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment.
So, let me now say to every Negro in this country: You must register.
You must vote.
You must learn, so your choice advances your interest and the interest of our beloved Nation.
Your future, and your children's future, depend upon it, and I do not believe that you are going to let them down.
This act is not only a victory for Negro leadership.
This act is a great challenge to that leadership.
It is a challenge which cannot be met simply by protests and demonstrations.
It means that dedicated leaders must work around the clock to teach people their rights and their responsibilities and to lead them to exercise those rights and to fulfill those responsibilities and those duties to their country.
If you do this, then you will find, as others have found before you, that the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.
Today what is perhaps the last of the legal barriers is tumbling.
There will be many actions and many difficulties before the rights woven into law are also woven into the fabric of our Nation.
But the struggle for equality must now move toward a different battlefield.
It is nothing less than granting every American Negro his freedom to enter the mainstream of American life: not the conformity that blurs enriching differences of culture and tradition, but rather the opportunity that gives each a chance to choose.
For centuries of oppression and hatred have already taken their painful toll.
It can be seen throughout our land in men without skills, in children without fathers, in families that are imprisoned in slums and in poverty.
For it is not enough just to give men rights.
They must be able to use those rights in their personal pursuit of happiness.
The wounds and the weaknesses, the outward walls and the inward scars which diminish achievement are the work of American society.
We must all now help to end them  help to end them through expanding programs already devised and through new ones to search out and forever end the special handicaps of those who are black in a Nation that happens to be mostly white.
So, it is for this purpose  to fulfill the rights that we now secure  that I have already called a White House conference to meet here in the Nation's Capital this fall.
So, we will move step by step  often painfully but, I think, with clear vision  along the path toward American freedom.
It is difficult to fight for freedom.
But I also know how difficult it can be to bend long years of habit and custom to grant it.
There is no room for injustice anywhere in the American mansion.
But there is always room for understanding toward those who see the old ways crumbling.
And to them today I say simply this: It must come.
It is right that it should come.
And when it has, you will find that a burden has been lifted from your shoulders, too.
It is not just a question of guilt, although there is that.
It is that men cannot live with a lie and not be stained by it.
The central fact of American civilization  one so hard for others to understand  is that freedom and justice and the dignity of man are not just words to us.
We believe in them.
Under all the growth and the tumult and abundance, we believe.
And so, as long as some among us are oppressed  and we are part of that oppression  it must blunt our faith and sap the strength of our high purpose.
Thus, this is a victory for the freedom of the American Negro.
But it is also a victory for the freedom of the American Nation.
And every family across this great, entire, searching land will live stronger in liberty, will live more splendid in expectation, and will be prouder to be American because of the act that you have passed that I will sign today.
Thank you.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
After discussion with Vice President Humphrey and members of the Space Council, as well as Defense Secretary McNamara, I am today instructing the Department of Defense to immediately proceed with the development of a manned orbiting laboratory.
This program will bring us new knowledge about what man is able to do in space.
It will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of America.
It will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned and unmanned space flight.
It will make it possible to perform very new and rewarding experiments with that technology and equipment.
The cost of developing the manned orbiting laboratory will be $1.
5 billion.
Unmanned flights to test launchings, recovery, and other basic parts of the system, will begin late next year or early 1967.
The initial unmanned launch of a fully equipped laboratory is scheduled for 1968.
This will be followed later that year by the first of five flights with two-man crews.
The Air Force has selected the Douglas Aircraft Company to design and to build the spacecraft in which the crew of the laboratory will live and operate.
The General Electric Company will plan and develop the space experiments.
The Titan III-C booster will launch the laboratory into space and a modified version of the NASA Gemini capsule will be the vehicle in which the astronauts return to earth.
Even as we meet, Gemini 5, piloted by two very gallant men, backed by hundreds of dedicated space scientists and engineers and great administrators, now orbits the earth as a dramatic reminder that our American dream for outer space is a dream of peace and a dream of friendly cooperation among all the nations of the earth.
We believe the heavens belong to the people of every country.
We are working and we will continue to work through the United Nationsour distinguished Ambassador,  Goldberg, is present with us this morningto extend the rule of law into outer space.
We intend to live up to our agreement not to orbit weapons of mass destruction and we will continue to hold out to all nations, including the Soviet Union, the hand of cooperation in the exciting years of space exploration which lie ahead for all of us.
Therefore, I havetoday, in factdirected  James Webb, the administrator of our civilian space program, after conferring with the Secretary of State and our Ambassador to the United Nations and others, to invite the Soviet Academy of Science to send a very high level representative here next month to observe the launching of Gemini 6.
I hope that he will find it convenient to come.
We will certainly give him a warm welcome in America.
This morning I have just concluded a breakfast meeting with the Cabinet and with the heads of Federal agencies.
I am asking each of them to immediately begin to introduce a very new and a very revolutionary system of planning and programing and budgeting throughout the vast Federal Government, so that through the tools of modern management the full promise of a finer life can be brought to every American at the lowest possible cost.
Under this new system each Cabinet and agency head will set up a very special staff of experts who, using the most modern methods of program analysis, will define the goals of their department for the coming year.
Once these goals are established, this system will permit us to find the most effective and the least costly alternative to achieving American goals.
This program is designed to achieve three major objectives: It will help us find new ways to do jobs faster, to do jobs better, and to do jobs less expensively.
It will insure a much sounder judgment through more accurate information, pinpointing those things that we ought to do more, spotlighting those things that we ought to do less.
It will make our decision-making process as up-to-date, I think, as our space exploring program.
Everything that I have done in both legislation and the construction of a budget has always been guided by my own very deep concern for the American people-consistent with wise management, of course, of the taxpayer's dollar.
So this new system will identify our national goals with precision and will do it on a continuing basis.
It will enable us to fulfill the needs of all the American people with a minimum amount of waste.
And because we will be able to make sounder decisions than ever before, I think the people of this Nation will receive greater benefits from every tax dollar that is spent in their behalf.
On July the 20th, I named as United States Ambassador to the United Nations a man to whom the sacred cause of peace is an obsessionJustice Arthur Goldberg.
So I am happy this morning to reinforce the United States team at the United Nations with four Americans who also share a passion for peace:As Ambassador Goldberg's principal Deputy, I am naming a career Ambassador with a distinguished record of more than 20 years in diplomacy Charles Yost.
As Representative to the Security Council, with the rank of Ambassador, I am naming the noted president of Howard University James Nabrit, As Representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, a famous American who is giving up his seat in Congress to become our new Ambassador- James Roosevelt, the eldest son of the late beloved Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Roosevelt is with us this morning.
Will you please stand,  Roosevelt?As Representative to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, also with the rank of Ambassador, a vibrant, attractive American woman who has already served as the Nation's chief diplomat in both Denmark and Bulgaria Eugenie Anderson of Minnesota.
Tomorrow I will sign into law one of the most important hi]Is enacted by Congress this session: the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.
To direct this far-reaching program of promise for the distressed areas all across America, I intend to nominate as Assistant Secretary of Commerce and as Director of Economic Development one of our most brilliant young public servants, the outstanding Administrator of the Small Business Administration- Eugene P.
Foley.
Please stand,  Foley.
I am also pleased to announce this morning the appointment of  Hobart Taylor, , as a member of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank.
Taylor has been Associate Special Counsel to the President since May 1964.
He was previously Executive Vice Chairman of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and has largely directed our efforts with the large corporations and institutions of this country in our plans for progress.
Will you please stand,  Taylor?He will be succeeded as my Associate Special Counsel by another talented young lawyer who holds degrees from both Harvard and Yale and now serves as Deputy Special Assistant to the President Clifford Alexander,   Alexander has recently reached the tired old age of 32.
Will you please stand,  Alexander?It is also a pleasure to announce the nomination this morning of the new United States Attorney for the District of Columbia-it may interest some of you people who live here in the District of Columbia David G.
Bress.
Bress has not only carried on a very vigorous private practice and civic life but he has taught in the field of law at American University, at Georgetown Law Center, the University of Virginia Law School, and has been head of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia.
Will you stand,  Bress?Fifty years ago, President Woodrow Wilson asked, Just what is it that America stands for? If she stands for one thing more than another, it is for the sovereignty of self-governing people.
So I am very proud of the progress that we are making toward that principle on one frontand I am disappointed at the lack of progress that we are making on another.
The Attorney General and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission have just reported to me what I think is a truly remarkable story: In the 19 days since I signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which I recommended to Congress and they promptly enacted, already a total of 27,385 Negroes in 13 counties in 3 Southern States have qualified to vote.
And they represent nearly one-third of the potential applicants in all those 13 counties.
Only this morning a team of Federal examiners will begin to list voters in the 14th county that has been designated by the Attorney General.
That new office will be opened in the town of Prentiss in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi.
I am equally encouraged by the high level of acceptance and I am very pleased with the compliance that we have had in scores of other Southern counties throughout the country.
A check of 45 counties in Georgia shows already that 99 percent of 2,000 Negro applicants have been registered without any difficulty.
In 50 Louisiana counties, not a single Negro has been rejected.
In Mississippi, nearly 12,000 Negroes have been registered by local registrarsover and above those that we mentioned that were registered by Federal examiners.
The number of Negro citizens registered in Mississippi has increased 100 percent in the last 6 weeks.
Obedience is always preferable to enforcement.
Where enforcement is necessary, we will not hesitate to meet our responsibilities under the law.
But the very clear and the very heartening lesson of this wonderful report is that obedience to the law is a fact of life to so many men and women of good will throughout the South.
On another fronthere in our lovely Nation's Capital Citythe sovereignty of self-governing people is still unresolved.
The people of the District of Columbia, I think deserve and I think must and will have home rule.
It is an irony and disgrace that having extended self-government already to the Philippine Islands and to Puerto Rico, having enthusiastically recommended democratic principles to nations around the world, nation after nation, after having welcomed Alaska and Hawaii as new States, that somehow some people seem to be afraid to trust almost a million American citizens with the management of their own affairs here in the District of Columbia.
Congress is moving to redeem this disgrace.
The Senateas on at least five different occasions in the pasthas acted to pass a good home rule bill containing a solid and a workable charter for home rule.
That bill should come before the House of Representatives very shortly.
The limits of reasonable delay have long since been reached and passed.
No one doubts the outcome once that bill finally gets to the floor of the House and the Members are permitted to vote on it.
But what is needed this morning is a commitment by the leadership and by the members of both parties, if you please, to the only practical means of getting the bill on the floor, and that seems to be the petition to discharge the House District Committee from further delay of the bill.
Bills have been pending before that committee for year after year after year.
So I have, as President, urged the Speaker of the House of Representatives,  McCormack, and the other leaders and members of my own party to lead the way in this movement.
But to all of those who believe in our two-party elective system, to all of those who believe in taxation with representation, to those who believe in keeping faith with our own people, I express the hope that you, too, will join us in this effort.
I am now ready to take any questions that you may have to ask.
Yes.
I think that the steel situation is on almost every citizen's mind in this country.
The decisions which will be made in Pittsburgh this week are of vital importance to every person in this country and to people in other parts of the world.
There must be continued cost and price stability in our American economy and I expect full and complete responsibility in the current wage negotiations and I expect continued stability in steel prices.
As we meet here today, we are troubled with many questions, but we must never forget that our boys are still fighting in South Viet-Nam and that our economic strength is the keystone of free world peace.
It is extremely important to the security that we hold very dear.
So the decisions that will be made this week by steel management and by labor in the days that are ahead must certainly take into account the overall greater national interest which is involved.
The Director of the Federal Mediation Service, one of my most trusted public servants,  William Simkin, is in Pittsburgh; and he is there for the purpose of making every contribution he can to assist the parties in reaching a responsible agreement.
The eyes of this country are on the leaders of both management and labor.
We are expecting and we believe we will receive the responsibility which the national interest requires.
6 No, I think that our operations have been up to our expectations.
I think a review and evaluation of them will reflect that they have been rather effective, and I think that they are in keeping with the planned purpose of their mission.
Well, I do not want to get into any personalities in the matter.
I think the issues of war and peace in Viet-Nam are far greater than any personal differences that one might havefor that matter, far greater than any party's.
I have said on many occasions, and I should like to repeat to the American people, and to Hanoi also, that I am very pleased with the support the American people are giving to the policies of their Government, both at home and abroad.
While our men are fighting and dying for freedom in South Viet-Nam, I am going to do everything that I can to support those men and to unite the country behind them.
I think that, generally speaking, the country is united behind them and I think this will be a source of strength to our boys out there.
I have received excellent cooperation from the leadership of both parties in the past, and I expect to continue in the future.
The boys that are fighting the war are not divided between Republicans and Democrats.
The men directing the strategies involved-I do not know what party they belong to.
The distinguished Secretary of Defense, before coming into Government, was a member of a party different from mine.
The President with whom I counsel often and who has had the greatest experience in not only political and diplomatic matters, but in matters of a military nature, President Eisenhower, has been a tower of strength to me, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Secretary of Defense, and to the leaders of the Congress.
So I would say that we welcome expressions of viewpoint from the leadership in both parties.
There will be times when we do not see everything alike, but that may contribute strength to our system.
I do not think that Hanoi should ever for a moment entertain the illusion that the people of this country are not united in the work of this Government.
I do not know how good a prophet I am.
I had put this legislation very high in our list.
I think it is extremely important.
I have continually urged the leadership to proceed with this consideration.
The House has it under study now.
I have talked to the Speaker at length, yesterday and again today.
I am sending him a letter later today expressing very strongly the views of the executive branch of the Government again.
I am hoping that that bill will pass as reported by the House Judiciary Committee without crippling amendments.
It has not been acted upon yet by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
I believe that it should be acted on before the Congress gets out of here.
I favor the House bill.
I think it will result in a great improvement not only in our relations with other nations but will be very satisfying to large segments of our own people.
I believe it will pass.
I would like to have the help of all of you, though, in that connection.
I would think that the Federal Government has a different situation from what we have in certain segments of our private sector, but I would hope that we would never ask for privileges for ourselves in Government that we would not expect private industry to share in.
Therefore, when you make allowances for the difference in public and private employment and the various policies and fringe benefits, I would hope that we could keep our civilian pay structure in line with the guidelines that we recommend for private industry.
I do think the House bill goes too far.
I do think that it would violate the guidelines.
I do hope that the Congress will carefully and thoroughly consider the destructive effect it would have if we should pass the bill in its present form.
We had a most distinguished panel of most distinguished Americans study this whole subject.
They made recommendations.
We would hope that the Congress would enact those recommendations with certain modifications that they thought were required, but certainly not go anywhere near the overall recommendations made by the House committee, because we think that would be very disastrous to our price-wage stability policy in this country and we think it would violate the guidelines.
I think that we are always hopeful that all the world is aware of our desire for discussions and our desire for negotiations and our desire for peace.
I do not think it is really important how much extra you get an hour in your steel contract, or what the increase of Federal pay is, if your boy is going to be drafted tomorrow and going to be called upon to give his life in Viet-Nam.
So peacepeace, that simple little 5-letter wordis the most important word in the English language to us at this time and it occupies more of our attention than any other word or any other subject.
We do expect they are listening; we do hope they are listening.
Secretary Rusk, Ambassador Goldberg, Secretary Ball, and all of the other trained diplomats that we have in this country are going to constantly be searching for ways and means to substitute words for guns, and to bring men from the battlefield to the conference table.
Our every waking hour is going to be spent trying to find the means for doing this.
I do not know of any question.
I certainly do.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
We have detailed action planned that we worked on until late in the evening last night.
Moyers will have a release available for you.
We did not want to take the television time and further time from your questions, but it will be available later in the week.
We are appointing a top-flight task force, headed by Deputy Attorney General Ramsey Clark, and they will proceed to Los Angeles at a very early date.
The details of their work and their program will be announced as soon as they are available.
Ambassador Bunker has done a very exceptional job there.
We are very hopeful that we can obtain agreement on provisional government, and that we can set up the guidelines that will result in an election at an early date where the people of that area can have self-determination and can make the selection of their own government officials.
We have felt very close to a solution several times, and we never are quite sure when it will come, but we expect it shortly.
I do not have the time to review all of my messages.
But as I remember it, there are about four bills still in House committees that have not been reported, that are being worked upon.
They include the highway improvement bill, beautification bill, and the heart, cancer, and stroke bill.
Larry O'Brien is a much better authority on this than I am.
He will be glad to be helpful in that respect.
There are some eight bills in Senate committees that still need to be reported.
There are a dozen or so bills that have been reported that need to be scheduled.
They are either awaiting a rule or awaiting schedule in one body or the other.
There are about six bills in conference, one of which has emerged recently, much to our satisfactionthe foreign aid bill.
We are hopeful that all of those measures can be moved.
There are relatively few to be reported.
There are a good many more to be scheduled.
There are only half a dozen in conference.
We think that in a reasonable time, by diligent worknot around the clock, but a full week in the next several weekswe can complete our program.
If we could, we would like to do that, so that the Members could go home and have some rest before coming back in January.
There will be some important messages for them, awaiting them, when they return in January, but we would not expect anything like the volume of substantive legislation next year.
We would expect several substantive bills like a transportation policy and like some refinements in our foreign policy, that we will be submitting messages on food and health and things of that nature.
But we look forward to the Congress being able to get out of here early next yearI would say certainly far ahead of the end of the fiscal year in Juneso that the Members could be at home and could report to the people.
We like for the Republicans and the Democrats all to be home and report to the people what is going on here, what is going on in the world, so they can be fully informed, and we think that it makes for a more united country.
I am always hesitant to make a prophecy about how good things are or how bad they are, because you fellows have a way of remembering what a public official says way back there and feeding it up to him from time to time.
But I think it must be evident to you that your Marines and your other soldiers in the Army, and the men in the Navy and the Air Force have been giving a good account of themselves.
And working very closely with the dedicated and patriotic and determined South Vietnamese, always associated with them and working with them, they have been quite effective in the last few weeks.
As I told you, in our last meeting, I plead with my Cabinet every time I see them.
I say to Secretary McNamara, You be sure that our men have the morale, and have the equipment, and have the necessary means of seeing that we keep our commitments in Viet-Nam, and we have the strength to do it.
I say to  Rusk, while he is working with his right hand on strength and stability there and doing the job we are committed to do, You and  Goldberg and the rest of you, use that left hand and be sure that you do everything to get us away from the battlefield and back at the conference table, if that is possible.
So we are like a man in a ring.
We are using our right and our left constantly.
I would agree that the whole situation there is very delicate, a matter that requires constant watching.
Our Secretary of State is doing that.
The President is doing it.
We have recently sent to Indonesia one of our most trained and trusted diplomats.
We are going to make every contribution that we can to try to preserve peace in that area.
We think that what we are doing in South Viet-Nam has a very important bearing on the whole sector of that part of the world.
I would not want to make any prophecies as to what the final outcome would be, other than we will be hopeful and we will be continuing in our efforts to contribute anything we can to a peaceful solution.
Well, first I reviewed that veto message very carefully late in the evening of the last day with most of my best legal advisers.
The statement as I remember it said that the Attorney General informed me that it was repugnant to the Constitution.
So I would refer you first to the Attorney General, and I know he would be glad to give great weight to any observations you might have.
I, myself, agree with the Attorney General.
I hope the Congress will share that view.
I think that we do owe the Congress a reasonable reporting procedure.
I indicated in my message that I would willingly make those reports if it could be worked out where it would not adversely affect our military posture or my duties as Commander in Chief.
I genuinely believe that the bill, in the form that I vetoed it, did considerably restrain the Commander in Chief and was not in the national interest.
Thank you,  President.
Speaker,  President, members of the House and the Senate, my fellow Americans:I come before you tonight to report on the State of the Union for the third time.
I come here to thank you and to add my tribute, once more, to the nation's gratitude for this, the 89th Congress.
This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America.
Our nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam.
Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you.
It just must be the center of our concerns.
But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people.
This nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home.
And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight.
I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year.
I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty.
I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth.
I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America.
I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins.
I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire federal system from prevention to probation.
I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in federal and state jury selection, by making it a serious federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.
I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the federal government by creating a new Cabinet-level Department of Transportation and reorganizing several existing agencies.
In turn, I will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both required as well as rewarded.
I will ask you to make it possible for members of the House of Representatives to work more effectively in the service of the nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to four years, concurrent with that of the President.
Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do.
We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency.
We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it.
We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society.
Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion.
Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years.
It will be only $1.
8 billion next year.
Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.
8 billion.
Revenues next year will be $111 billion.
On a cash basis  which is the way that you and I keep our family budget  the federal budget next year will actually show a surplus.
That is to say, if we include all the money that your government will take in and all the money that your government will spend, your government next year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967.
I have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures.
I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans.
There are men who cry out: We must sacrifice.
Well, let us rather ask them: Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?Time may require further sacrifices.
And if it does, then we will make them.
But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty.
I believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam.
But if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the name of justice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need.
And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight.
Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great chamber.
The Great Society leads us along three roads  growth and justice and liberation.
First is growth  the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress.
I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already  in every city and countryside.
This nation is flourishing.
Workers are making more money than ever  with after-tax income in the past five years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent.
More people are working than ever before in our history  an increase last year of two and a half million jobs.
Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history.
For the past five years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent.
Average farm income is higher than ever.
Over the past five years it is up 40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone.
I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $2.
8 billion in 1964 to $1.
3 billion, or less, in 1965.
This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your government.
We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year.
And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land.
It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight.
I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago.
Without raising taxes  or even increasing the total tax bill paid  we should move to improve our withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date.
I hope these measures will be adequate.
But if the necessities of Vietnam require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed.
The second road is justice.
Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin.
I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in federal and state courts  and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements.
I propose legislation to strengthen authority of federal courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights  and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime.
Legislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the federal government, to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.
For that other nation within a nation  the poor  whose distress has now captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty.
And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience.
To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources.
For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our states equal to the laws of the 31 states which do not have tonight right-to-work measures.
And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without improperly invading state and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest.
The third path is the path of liberation.
It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives.
A great nation is one which breeds a great people.
A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius.
That alone is a Great Society.
Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough.
In the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and which individual abundance alone will not overcome.
We can subdue and we can master these forces  bring increased meaning to our lives  if all of us, government and citizens, are bold enough to change old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people.
This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.
Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our armed forces.
I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate  the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for the District of Columbia.
In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people.
Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life.
I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas.
Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air.
We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people.
To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces.
Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets  and that right just must be secured.
Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways.
I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy.
We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer  requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents  all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed  and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.
It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention.
We must change to master change.
I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch, to modernize the relations between city and state and nation.
A new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our transportation activities.
The present structure  35 government agencies, spending $5 billion yearly  makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great nation or the needs of the industry, or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality.
I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound  in excess of 2,000 miles per hour.
I propose to examine our federal system-the relation between city, state, nation, and the citizens themselves.
We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job.
I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people.
As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors.
Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions  to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and state committees under the act  to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions  and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice.
To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a four-year term for Members of the House of Representatives  which should not begin before 1972.
The present two-year term requires most members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning  depriving this nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom.
Today, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating.
And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life.
The nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a four-year term for members of the House.
And I urge your swift action.
Tonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam.
That conflict is not an isolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since World War IIThe touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States  the welfare and the freedom of the people of the United States.
But nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass.
In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster.
An America that is mighty beyond description  yet living in a hostile or despairing world  would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man.
In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe.
We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin.
In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence.
We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world.
And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice.
In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression  in Korea under President Truman  in the Formosa Straits under President Eisenhower  in Cuba under President Kennedy  and again in Vietnam.
Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation.
I will discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents.
The first principle is strength.
Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments.
We will need expenditures of $58.
3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might.
While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $5.
8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire federal budget will rise this coming year by only $0.
6 billion.
This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the other departments of government.
A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction.
We will vigorously pursue existing proposals  and seek new ones  to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.
A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world.
By strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by meeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world.
We will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for Progress, the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the regional organizations of developing continents, and that supreme association  the United Nations.
We will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to trade, and to improve international finance.
A fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man.
From the Marshall Plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands.
This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves.
We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance.
We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture.
We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children.
To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966.
I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared  for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research  and we will earmark funds to help their efforts.
In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world.
The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence  the right of each people to govern themselves  and to shape their own institutions.
For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself.
We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule.
We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few  or the oppression of one race by another.
We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe.
And I will ask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West.
The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of today's world in which we live.
In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will.
It is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire.
In recent months a number of nations have east out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland China.
History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people.
History does not favor a single system or belief  unless force is used to make it so.
That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba  and tonight in Vietnam.
For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young Americans die in a distant land.
Tonight, as so many nights before, the American Nation is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom.
How many times  in my lifetime and in yours  have the American people gathered, as they do now, to hear their President tell them of conflict and tell them of danger?Each time they have answered.
They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this nation required.
And they do again tonight in Vietnam.
Not too many years ago Vietnam was a peaceful, if troubled, land.
In the North was an independent Communist government.
In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of the United States.
There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people.
But their progress was slight.
Their hope of success was dim.
Then, little more than six years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest.
And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression.
As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear.
We could leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam.
We stayed.
And we will stay until aggression has stopped.
We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's solemn pledge  a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American Presidents.
We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and in America's protection.
To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet the appetite of aggression.
We would have to fight in one land, and then we would have to fight in another  or abandon much of Asia to the domination of Communists.
And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest.
Last year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again.
Swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the South.
Attack and terror increased, spurred and encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near.
Despite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold back the mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the South, and to make our firmness clear to the North.
Thus.
we began limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam.
We increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 men.
These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success.
The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of Americans and their allies  and by the enduring courage of the South Vietnamese who, I can tell you, have lost eight men last year for every one of ours.
The enemy is no longer close to victory.
Time is no longer on his side.
There is no cause to doubt the American commitment.
Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace.
In 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam, with friends and adversaries throughout the world.
Since Christmas your government has labored again, with imagination and endurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement.
For 20 days now we and our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam.
Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more than 40 countries.
We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all 113 that we have relations with, and some that we do not.
We have talked to the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.
In public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and to friends, in Rome and Warsaw, in Paris and Tokyo, in Africa and throughout this hemisphere, America has made her position abundantly clear.
We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military alliance in Vietnam.
We fight for the principle of self-determination  that the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course, choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without fear.
The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification.
This is all we want for South Vietnam.
It is all the people of South Vietnam want.
And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard.
We have also made it clear  from Hanoi to New York  that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace.
We stand by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962.
We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any proposals  four points or 14 or 40  and we will consider the views of any group.
We will work for a cease-fire now or once discussions have begun.
We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future.
We have said all this, and we have asked  and hoped  and we have waited for a response.
So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure.
We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to our own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes.
We have found understanding and support.
And we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace.
I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future may require.
We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard conference, or even both at once.
Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear.
We will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South Vietnam.
We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger.
But we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and every dollar, and every decision  whatever the cost or whatever the challenge.
And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war.
And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle.
There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will.
But for others it must now be clear  the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose.
The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education  the chance to build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of battle  the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny.
For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs.
It is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will, and so many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death.
To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight: Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the servant of life.
In this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve.
This is the State of the Union.
But over it all  wealth, and promise, and expectation  lies our troubling awareness of American men at war tonight.
How many men who listen to me tonight have served their nation in other wars? How very many are not here to listen?The war in Vietnam is not like these other wars.
Yet, finally, war is always the same.
It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise.
It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate.
Therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world.
Many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me.
But there is a difference.
For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire, against all the most inward pulls of my desire.
For we have children to teach, and we have sick to be cured, and we have men to be freed.
There are poor to be lifted up, and there are cities to be built, and there is a world to be helped.
Yet we do what we must.
I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires.
Yet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble.
I believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk.
And from that belief your President summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come.
The work must be our work now.
Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth.
Thank you, and goodnight.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen: For 37 days, no bombs fell on North Vietnam.
During that time, we have made a most intensive and determined effort to enlist the help and the support of all the world in order to persuade the Government in Hanoi that peace is better than war, that talking is better than fighting, and that the road to peace is open.
Our effort has met with understanding and support throughout most of the world, but not in Hanoi and Peking.
From those two capitals have come only denunciation and rejection.
In these 37 days, the efforts of our allies have been rebuffed.
The efforts of neutral nations have come to nothing.
We have sought, without success, to learn of any response to efforts made by the governments of Eastern Europe.
There has been no answer to the enlightened efforts of the Vatican.
Our own direct private approaches have all been in vain.
The answer of Hanoi to all is the answer that was published 3 days ago.
They persist in aggression.
They insist on the surrender of South Vietnam to communism.
It is, therefore, very plain that there is no readiness or willingness to talk, no readiness for peace in that regime today.
And what is plain in words is also plain in acts.
Throughout these 37 days, even at moments of truce, there has been continued violence against the people of South Vietnam, against their Government, against their soldiers, and against our own American forces.
We do not regret the pause in the bombing.
We yield to none in our determination to seek peace.
We have given a full and decent respect to the opinions of those who thought that such a pause might give new hope for peace in the world.
Some said that 10 days might do it.
Others said 20.
Now, we have paused for twice the time suggested by some of those who urged it.
And now the world knows more clearly than it has ever known before who it is that insists on aggression and who it is that works for peace.
The Vietnamese, American, and allied troops that are engaged in South Vietnam, with increasing strength and increasing success, want peace, I am sure, as much as any of us here at home.
But while there is no peace, those men are entitled to the full support of American strength and American determinationand we will give them both.
As constitutional Commander in Chief, I have, as I must, given proper weight to the judgment of those, all of those, who have any responsibility for counseling with me or sharing with me the burdensome decisions that I am called upon to make: the distinguished Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, my National Security Adviser, and America's professional military men, represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
These advisers tell me that if continued immunity is given to all that support North Vietnam aggression, the cost in livesVietnamese lives and American lives and allied liveswill only be greatly increased.
In the light of the words and actions of the Government in Hanoi for more than 37 days now, it is our clear duty to do what we can to limit these costs.
So on this Monday morning in Vietnam, at my direction, after complete and thorough consultation and agreement with the Government of South Vietnam, United States aircraft have resumed action in North Vietnam.
They struck the lines of supply which support the continuing movement of men and arms against the people and the Government of South Vietnam.
Our air strikes on North Vietnam from the beginning have been aimed at military targets and have been controlled with the greatest of care.
Those who direct and supply the aggression really have no claim to immunity from military reply.
The end of the pause does not mean the end of our own pursuit of peace.
That pursuit will be as determined and as unremitting as the pressure of our military strength on the field of battle.
In our continuing pursuit of peace, I have instructed Ambassador Goldberg at the United Nations to ask for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
He will present a full report on the situation in Vietnam, and a resolution which can open the way to the conference table.
This report and this resolution will be responsive to the spirit of the renewed appeal of Pope Paul, and that appeal has our full sympathy.
I have asked Secretary Rusk to meet with the representatives of the press later this morning to give to the country and to the entire world a thorough and a comprehensive account of all of the diplomatic efforts conducted in these last 5 weeks in our continuing policy of peace and freedom for South Vietnam.
Secretary, ladies and gentlemen: I am very pleased to address the Foreign Service Institute this morning and to come here to meet with so many Americans that are preparing to serve their country abroad.
As one who believes that we cannot shorten our reach in the world, I am greatly encouraged by the number and the quality of those who are studying at this Institute.
You have the gratitude of your countrymen and my own assurance of support.
We have come a long way from the day that someone observed that some diplomat no doubt will launch a heedless word and lurking war leap out.
That was more than half a century ago when diplomacy was often war by another name.
Today your task is different.
Those of you about to go abroad represent a continuity of purpose in a generation of change.
That purpose is to build from reason and moderation a world order in which the fires of conflict yield to the fulfillment of man's oldest yearnings for himself and his family.
Your job, wherever you serve, is peace.
That is the task that faces all of us today.
The question, as always, is how? How do we, for example, maintain the security of the Atlantic community upon which so many of the world's hopes depend?For the answer, we must begin with the gray dawn of the world of 1945, when Europe's cities lay in rubble, her farms devastated, her industries smashed, her people weary with war and death and defeat.
Now from that desolation has come abundance.
From that weakness has come power.
From those ashes of holocaust has come the rebirth of a strong and a vital community.
The Europe of today is a new Europe.
In place of uncertainty there is confidence; in place of decay, progress; in place of isolation, partnership; in place of war, peace.
If there is no single explanation for the difference between Europe then and Europe now, there is a pattern.
It is a luminous design that is woven through the history of the past 20 years.
It is the design of common action, of interdependent institutions serving the good of the European nations as though they were all one.
It is the design of collective security protecting the entire Atlantic community.
So I have come here this morning to speak to you of one important part of that design.
I speak of a structure that some of you have helped to build: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Let me make clear in the beginning that we do not believe there is any righteousness in standing pat.
If an organization is alive and vital, if it is to have meaning for all time as well as for any particular time, it must grow and respond and yield to change.
Like our Constitution, which makes the law of the land, the North Atlantic Treaty is more than just a legal document.
It is the foundation of a living institution.
That institution is NATO, the organization created to give meaning and reality to the alliance commitments.
The crowded months which immediately preceded and followed the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty 17 years ago had produced an atmosphere of crisis.
It was a crisis that was born of deep fear: fear for Europe's economic and political vitality, fear of Communist aggression, fear of Communist subversion.
Some say that new circumstances in the world today call for the dismantling of this great organization.
Of course NATO should adapt to the changing needs of the times, but we believe just as firmly that such change must be wrought by the member nations working with one another within the alliance.
Consultation, not isolation, is the route to reform.
We must not forget either in success or abundance the lessons that we have learned in danger and in isolation: that whatever the issue that we share, we have one common dangerdivision; and one common safetyunity.
What is our view of NATO today?We see it not as an alliance to make war, but as an alliance to keep peace.
Through an era as turbulent as man has ever known, and under the constant threat of ultimate destruction, NATO has insured the security of the North Atlantic community.
It has reinforced stability elsewhere throughout the world.
While NATO rests on the reality that we must fight together if war should come to the Atlantic area, it rests also on the reality that war will not come if we act together during peace.
It was the Foreign Minister of France who, in 1949, insisted that to be truly secure, Europe needed not only help in resisting attack, but help in preventing attack.
Liberation, he said, is not enough.
The success of NATO has been measured by many yardsticks.
The most significant, to me, is the most obvious: War has been deterred.
Through the common organization, we have welded the military contributions of each of the 15 allies into a very effective instrument.
So convincing was this instrument that potential aggressors took stock and counted as too high the price of satisfying their ambitions.
It has been proved true that one sword keeps another in the sheath.
War has been deterred not only because of our integrated military power, but because of the political unity of purpose to which that power has been directed and bent.
It is difficult to overstate the importance of the bonds of culture, of political institutions, traditions, and values which form the bedrock of the Atlantic community.
There is here a political integrity and an identity of interests that transcends personalities and issues of the moment.
If our collective effort should falter and our common determination be eroded, the foundation of the Atlantic's present stability would certainly be shaken.
The mightiest arsenal in the world will deter no aggressor who knows that his victims are too divided to decide and too unready to respond.
That was the lesson that we learned from two world wars.
Yet a nationnot by the action of her friends, but by her own decision to prepare and plan alonecould still imperil her own security by creating a situation in which response would be too late and too diluted.
Every advance in the technology of war makes more unacceptable the old and narrow concepts of sovereignty.
No one today can doubt the necessity of preventing war.
It is our firm conviction that collective action through NATO is the best assurance that war will be deterred in the Atlantic world.
Look at the Atlantic community through the eyes of those who in years past have yearned for conquest.
The sight is sobering.
Integrated commands, common plans, forces in being in advance of an emergency for use in any emergencyall of these testify to a collective readiness and the integrity of collective purposes.
To other eyes, NATO can only be a clear warning of the folly of aggression.
NATO today, therefore, must be shaped on the experience of the past.
Reliance on independent action by separate forcesonly loosely coordinated with joint forces and planstwice led to world wars before 1945.
But collective action has proved successful in deterring war since 1945during 20 years of upheaval and grave danger.
We reject those experiences only at our own peril.
For our part, the United States of America is determined to join with 13 of her other allies to preserve and to strengthen the deterrent strength of NATO We will urge that those principles of joint and common preparation be extended wherever they can be usefully applied in the Atlantic Alliance.
We are hopeful that no member of the treaty will long remain withdrawn from the mutual affairs and obligations of the Atlantic.
A place of respect and responsibility will await any ally who decides to return to the common task.
For the world is still full of peril for those who prize and cherish libertyperil and opportunity.
These bountiful lands that are washed by the Atlantic, this half-billion people that are unmatched in arms and industry, this cradle of common values and splendid visions, this measureless storehouse of wealth, can enrich the life of an entire planet.
It is this strengthof ideas as well as strength of arms, of peaceful purpose as well as powerthat offers such hope for the reconciliation of Western Europe with the people of Eastern Europe.
To surrender that strength now by isolation from one another would be to dim the promise of that day when the men and women of all Europe shall again move freely among each other.
It is not a question of wealth alone.
It is a question of heart and mind.
It is a willingness to leave forever those national rivalries which so often led to the useless squandering of lives and treasure in war.
It is a question of the deeper spirit of unity of which NATO is but a symbol.
That unity was never better expressed than when, at the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, a great French leader declared that nations are more and more convinced that their fates are closely bound togetherthat their salvation and their welfare must rest upon the progressive application of human solidarity.
And it is to the preservation of human solidarity that all of our efforts today should be directed.
So let all of you of the Foreign Service Institute make it your task, as well as mine.
Thank you and good morning.
Chief Justice,  Secretary, Senator Kennedy, Members of the fine delegation from New York, ladies and gentlemen at the head table, my fellow Americans: To be honored with this award by this organization is a very proud moment for me.
I accept it with the gratitude of my heart and with renewed commitment to the cause that it represents, the cause of freedom at home and the cause of freedom abroad.
Twenty-five years ago, to a world that was darkened by war, President Franklin Roosevelt described the four freedoms of mankind:Freedom of speech and expression.
Freedom of every person to worship God in his own way.
Freedom from want.
Freedom from fear.
Franklin Roosevelt knew that these freedoms could not be the province of one people alone.
He called on all his countrymen to assist those who endured the tyrant's bombs and suffered his opposition and oppression.
He called for courage and for generosity, and for resolution in the face of terror.
And then he said,Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere.
Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights-or keep them.
Wendell Willkie, Franklin Roosevelt's opponent in the campaign of 1940, shared his belief that freedom could not be founded only on American shores or only for those whose skin is white.
Freedom is an indivisible word, Wendell Willkie said.
If we want to enjoy it and fight for it we must be prepared to extend it to everyone, whether they are rich or poor, whether they agree with us or not, no matter what their race or the color of their skin.
That was Republican policy 25 years ago.
It was Democratic policy 25 years ago.
It is Americana policy here tonight.
Then how well have we done in our time in making the four freedoms real for our people and for the other people of the world?Here in America we accord every man the right to worship as he wills.
I believe we are more tolerant of sectional and religious and racial differences than we were a quarter of a century ago.
The majority of our people believe that a qualified man or woman, of any race, of any religion, of any section, could hold any office in our land.
This was not sonot very dear at all in 1940.
We are committed now, however great the trial and tension, to protecting the right of free expression and peaceful dissent.
We have learned to despise the witch hunt, the unprincipled harassment of a man's integrity and his right to be different.
We have gained in tolerance, and I am determined to use the high office I hold to protect and to encourage that tolerance.
I do not mean to say that I will remain altogether silent on the critical issues of our day.
For just as strongly as I believe in other men's freedom to disagree, so do I also believe in the President's freedom to attempt to persuade.
So let me assure you and my fellow Americans tonight that I will do everything in my power to defend both.
Twenty-five years ago freedom from want had the ring of urgency for our people.
The unemployment rate stood at 14.
5 percent.
Millions of Americans had spent the last decade in the breadlines or on farms where the winds howled away any chance for a decent life.
Tonight there are still millions whose poverty haunts our conscience.
There are still fathers without jobs, and there are still children without hope.
Yet for the vast majority of Americans these are times when the hand of plenty has replaced the grip of want.
And for the first time in almost 9 years tonight the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 percent.
This liberation from wantfor which we thank Godis a testimony to the enduring vitality of the American competitive system, the American free enterprise economy.
It is a testimony also to an enlightened public policy, established by Franklin Roosevelt and strengthened by every administration since his death.
That policy has freed Americans for more hopeful and more productive lives.
It has relieved their fears of growing old by social security and by medical care.
It has inspired them with hope for their children by aid to elementary and higher education.
It has helped to create economic opportunity by enlightened fiscal policies.
It has granted to millions, born into hopelessness, the chance of a new start in life by public works, by private incentive, by poverty programs.
For the Negro American, it has opened the door after centuries of enslavement and discriminationopened the doors to the blessings that America offers to those that are willing and able to earn them.
Thus we address the spirit of Franklin Roosevelt, 25 years after his message to America and the world, with confidence and with an unflagging determination.
We have served his vision of the four freedoms essential to mankindhere in America.
Yet we know that he did not speak only for America.
We know that the four freedoms are not secure in America when they are violently denied elsewhere in the world.
We know, too, that it requires more than speeches to resist the international enemies of freedom.
We know that men respond to deeds when they are deaf to words.
Even the precious word freedom may become empty to those without the means to use it.
For what does freedom meanwhen famine chokes the land,when new millions crowd upon already strained resources,when narrow privilege is entrenched behind law and custom,when all conspires to teach men that they cannot change the condition of their lives?I do not need to tell you how five administrations have labored to give real meaning to freedom, in a world where it is often merely a phrase that conceals oppression and neglect.
Men in this room, men throughout America, have given their skills and their treasure to that work.
You have warned our people how insatiable is aggression, and how it thrives on human misery.
You have carried the word that without the sense that they can change the conditions of their lives, nothing can avail the oppressed of this earthneither good will, nor national sovereignty, nor massive grants of aid from their more fortunate brothers.
You have known, too, that men who believe they can change their destinies will change their destinies.
Armed with that belief, they will be willing-yes, they will be eagerto make the sacrifices that freedom demands.
They will be anxious to shoulder the responsibilities that are inseparably bound to freedom.
They will be able to look beyond the four essential freedomsbeyond to the freedom to learn, to master new skills, to acquaint themselves with the lore of man and nature;to the freedom to grow, to become the best that is within them to become, to cast off the yoke of discrimination and disease;to the freedom to hope, and to build on that hope, lives of integrity and well-being.
This is what our struggle in Vietnam is all about tonight.
This is what our struggle for equal rights in this country is all about tonight.
We seek to create that climate, at home and abroad, where unlettered men can learn, where deprived children can grow, where hopeless millions can be inspired to change the terms of their existence for the better.
That climate cannot be created where terror fills the air.
Children cannot learn, and men cannot earn their bread, and women cannot heal the sick where the night of violence has blotted out the sun.
Whether in the cities and hamlets of Vietnam, or in the ghettos of our own cities, the struggle is the same.
That struggle is to end the violence against the human mind and bodyso that the work of peace may be done, and the fruits of freedom may be won.
We are pitting the resources of the law, of education and training, of our vision and our compassion, against that violence here in America.
And we shall end it in our time.
On the other side of the earth we are no less committed to ending violence against men who are struggling tonight to be free.
And it is about that commitment that I have come here to speak now.
Tonight in Vietnam more than 200,000 of your young Americans stand there fighting for your freedom.
Tonight our people are determined that these men shall have whatever help they need, and that their cause, which is our cause, shall be sustained.
But in these last days there have been questions about what we are doing in Vietnam, and these questions have been answered loudly and clearly for every citizen to see and to hear.
The strength of America can never be sapped by discussion, and we have no better nor stronger tradition than open debate, free debate, in hours of danger.
We believe, with Macaulay, that men are never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss it freely.
We are united in our commitment to free discussion.
So also we are united in our determination that no foe anywhere should ever mistake our arguments for indecision, nor our debates for weakness.
So what are the questions that are still being asked?First, some ask if this is a war for unlimited objectives.
The answer is plain.
The answer is no.
Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression.
It is not conquest; it is not empire; it is not foreign bases; it is not domination.
It is, simply put, just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam.
Second, some people ask if we are caught in a blind escalation of force that is pulling us headlong toward a wider war that no one wants.
The answer, again, is a simple no.
We are using that force and only that force that is necessary to stop this aggression.
Our fighting men are in Vietnam because tens of thousands of invaders came south before them.
Our numbers have increased in Vietnam because the aggression of others has increased in Vietnam.
The high hopes of the aggressor have been dimmed and the tide of the battle has been turned, and our measured use of force will and must be continued.
But this is prudent firmness under what I believe is careful control.
There is not, and there will not be, a mindless escalation.
Third, others ask if our fighting men are to be denied the help they need.
The answer again is, and will be, a resounding no.
Our great Military Establishment has moved 200,000 men across 10,000 miles since last spring.
These men have, and will have, all they need to fight the aggressor.
They have already performed miracles in combat.
And the men behind them have worked miracles of supply, building new ports, transporting new equipment, opening new roads.
The American forces of freedom are strong tonight in South Vietnam, and we plan to keep them so.
As you know, they are led there by a brilliant and a resourceful commander, Gen.
William C.
Westmoreland.
He knows the needs of war and he supports the works of peace.
And when he asks for more Americans to help the men that he has, his requests will be immediately studied, and, as I promised the Nation last July, his needs will be immediately met.
Fourth, some ask if our men go alone to Vietnam, if we alone respect our great commitment in the Southeast Asia Treaty.
Still again the answer is a simple no.
We have seven allies in SEATO, and we have seen five of them give us vital support, each with his own strength and in his own way, to the cause of freedom in Southeast Asia.
Fifth, some ask about the risks of a wider war, perhaps against the vast land armies of Red China.
And again the answer is no, never by any act of oursand not if there is any reason left behind the wild words from Peking.
We have threatened no one, and we will not.
We seek the end of no regime, and we will not.
Our purpose is solely to defend against aggression.
To any armed attack, we will reply.
We have measured the strength and the weakness of others, and we think we know our own.
We observe in ourselves, and we applaud in others, a careful restraint in action.
We can live with anger in word as long as it is matched by caution in deed.
Sixth, men ask if we rely on guns alone.
Still again the answer is no.
From our Honolulu meeting, from the clear pledge which joins us with our allies in Saigon, there has emerged a common dedication to the peaceful progress of the people of Vietnamto schools for their children, to care for their health, to hope and bounty for their land.
The Vice President returned tonight from his constructive and very highly successful visit to Saigon and to other capitals, and he tells me that he and Ambassador Lodge have found a new conviction and purpose in South Vietnamfor the battle against want and injustice as well as the battle against aggression.
So the pledge of Honolulu will be kept, and the pledge of Baltimore stands open-to help the men of the North when they have the wisdom to be ready.
We Americans must understand how fundamental is the meaning of this second warthe war on want.
I talked on my ranch last fall with Secretary Freeman, Secretary of Agriculture, and in my office last week with Secretary Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, making over and over again the same central point: The breeding ground of war is human misery.
If we are not to fight forever in faraway placesin Europe, or the far Pacific, or the jungles of Africa, or the suburbs of Santo Domingothen we just must learn to get at the roots of violence.
As a Nation we must magnify our struggle against world hunger and illiteracy and disease.
We must bring hope to men whose lives now end at two score or less.
Because without that hope, without progress in this war on want, we will be called on again to fight again and again, as we are fighting tonight.
Seventh, men ask who has a right to rule in South Vietnam.
Our answer there is what it has been here for 200 years.
The people must have this rightthe South Vietnamese peopleand no one else.
Washington will not impose upon the 'people of South Vietnam a government not of their choice.
Hanoi shall not impose upon the people of South Vietnam a government not of their choice.
So we will insist for ourselves on what we require from Hanoi: respect for the principle of government by the consent of the governed.
We stand for self-determinationfor free electionsand we will honor their result.
Eighth, men ask if we are neglecting any hopeful chance of peace.
And the answer is no.
A great servant of peace, Secretary Dean Rusk, has sent the message of peace on every wire and by every hand to every continent.
A great pleader for peace here with us tonight, Ambassador Arthur Goldberg, has worked at home and abroad in this same cause.
Their undiscouraged efforts will continue.
How much wiser it would have been, how much more compassionate towards its own people, if Hanoi had only come to the bargaining table at the close of the year.
Then the 7,000 Communist troops who have died in battle since January 1, and the many thousands who have been wounded in that same period, would have lived at peace with their fellow men.
Today, as then, Hanoi has the opportunity to end the increasing toll the war is taking on those under its command.
Ninth, some ask how long we must bear this burden.
To that question, in all honesty, I can give you no answer tonight.
During the Battle of Britain, when that nation stood alone in 1940, Winston Churchill gave no answer to that question.
When the forces of freedom were driven from the Philippines, President Roosevelt could not and did not name the date that we would return.
If the aggressor persists in Vietnam, the struggle may well be long.
Our men in battle know and they accept this hard fact.
We who are at home can do as much, because there is no computer that can tell the hour and the day of peace, but we do know that it will come only to the steadfast and never to the weak in heart.
Tenth, and finally, men ask if it is worth it.
I think you know that answer.
It is the answer that Americans have given for a quarter of a century, wherever American strength has been pledged to prevent aggression.
The contest in Vietnam is confused and hard, and many of its forms are new.
Yet our American purpose and policy are unchanged.
Our men in Vietnam are there.
They are there, as Secretary Dillon told you, to keep a promise that was made 12 years ago.
The Southeast Asia Treaty promised, as Secretary John Foster Dulles said for the United Statesthat an attack upon the treaty area would occasion a reaction so united, and so strong, and so well placed that the aggressor would lose more than it could hope to gain.
But we keep more than a specific treaty promise in Vietnam tonight.
We keep the faith for freedom.
Four Presidents have pledged to keep that faith.
The first was Franklin D.
Roosevelt, in his State of the Union Message 25 years ago.
He said:.
we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers.
We know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom.
The second was Harry S.
Truman, in 1947, at a historic turning point in the history of guerrilla warfareand of Greece, Turkey, and the United States.
These were his words then:I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.
I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.
The third was Dwight D.
Eisenhower, in his first Inaugural Address.
He promised this:Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security.
Americans, indeed, all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains.
And then 5 years ago, John F.
Kennedy, on the cold bright noon of his first day in Office, proclaimed:Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americansborn in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritageand unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.
Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
This is the American tradition.
Built in free discussion, proven on a hundred battlefields, rewarded by a progress at home that has no match in history, it beckons us forward tonight to the work of peace in Vietnam.
We will build freedom while we fight, and we will seek peace every day by every honorable means.
But we will persevere along the high hard road of freedom.
We are too old to be foolhardy and we are too young to be tired.
We are too strong for fear and too determined for retreat.
Each evening when I retire, I take up-from a bedside tablereports from the battlefront and reports from the capitals around the world.
They tell me how our men have fared that day in the hills and the valleys of Vietnam.
They tell me what hope there seems to be that the message of peace will be heard, and that this tragic war may be ended.
I read of individual acts of heroismof dedicated men and women whose valor matches that of any generation that has ever gone before.
I read of men risking their lives to save othersof men giving their lives to save freedom.
Always among these reports are a few letters from the men out there themselves.
If there is any doubt among some here at home about our purpose in Vietnam, I never find it reflected in those letters from Vietnam.
Our soldiers, our Marines, our airmen, and our sailors know why they are in Vietnam.
They know, as five Presidents have known, how inseparably bound together are America's freedom and the freedom of her friends around the world.
So tonight let me read you from a letter that I received from an American father, a warm friend of mine of many years, about his son, a young Army captain.
He said, I have never known a man at war who showed less bravado in his communications with home.
When he was not flying missions in his helicopter or working out of the battalion headquarters he and some of his buddies on their own visited the orphanages as individuals and played with the kids.
He was deeply interested in the Vietnamese people, particularly the peasants, and he told me how sorely they wanted, more than anything else, to just be left alone in some semblance of freedom to grow their rice and to raise their families.
This good young American, as thousands like him, was not on the other side of the world fighting specifically for you or for me,  President.
He was fighting in perhaps our oldest American tradition, taking up for people who are king pushed around.
The young captain described in this letter is dead tonight, but his spirit lives in the 200,000 young Americans who stand out there on freedom's frontier in Vietnam.
It lives in their mothers and in their fathers here in America who have proudly watched them leave their homes for their distant struggle.
So tonight I ask each citizen to join me, to join mein the homes and the meeting places our men are fighting to keep freein a prayer for their safety.
I ask you to join me in a pledge to the cause for which they fightthe cause of human freedom to which this great organization is dedicated.
Is ask you for your help, for your understanding, and for your commitment, so that this united people may show forth to all the world that America has not ended the only struggle that is worthy of man's unceasing sacrificethe struggle to be free.
Governor and  Morrison, Mayor Al Sorensen, Governor Phil Sorensen, my dear and good friend Congressman Callan, ladies and gentlemen of the great State of Nebraska: I want you to know, Governor Morrison, that I have not been able to hear much about anything, since you and Mayor Sorensen and Governor Sorensen and  Morrison kept Lady Bird out here beautifying for an entire day, except about the glories of Nebraska.
I am delighted to come back to Omaha and to this great State to confirm all the good things that she has said to me about you.
I have come to Omaha today because I want to speak to you about the most important business in our timethe business of peace in the world.
Two years ago this week, when I was also speaking out here in the Midwest, I said that the peace we seek is a world where no nation fears another, or no nation can force another to follow its command.
It is a world where differences are solved without destruction and common effort is directed at common problems.
This is still true as we meet here this afternoon.
I am convinced that after decades of wars and threats of wars, peace is more within our reach than at any time in this century.
I believe this because we have made up our minds to deal with the two most common threats to peace in the world.
We are determined to match our resolution with action.
But what are these threats?First is the desire of most people to win a better way of life.
That is true of you here in Omaha, and that is true of most people who want to win a better way of life everywhere in the world.
Second is the design of a few people, the design of some people, to force their particular way of life on other people.
Now if we ignore these threats, or if we attempt to meet them only by the rhetoric of visionary intentions instead of good works of determination, I am certain that tyranny and not peace will be our ultimate fate.
If the strong and the wealthy turn from the needs of the weak and the poor, frustration is sure to be followed by force.
No peace and no power is strong enough to stand for long against the restless discontent of millions of human beings who are without any hope.
That is why we stand here this afternoon in Omaha, at the end of a very important lifeline.
At the other end of that lifeline, 8,000 long miles out yonder, is IndiaIndia, a nation of 500 million human beings.
The wheat here this afternoon is part of their shield against the catastrophe of drought and famine.
This single load of grain will provide the margin of life for more than 2,500 families throughout the entire balance of this year.
But it is only a very tiny fraction of what America's response to India's need has been.
I would remind you that since January 1, 5 million tons of American wheat have already been shipped to India.
That is more than 2 1/2 times the annual wheat production of the State of Nebraska.
And this is only about half the grain that we and other nations are providing India this year in order to help her overcome the worst drought that her people have ever suffered in the history of her nation.
And America's job is not yet over.
Here, today, in the center of the greatest food-producing area anywhere on this globe, we Americans must face a sobering fact: Most of the world's population is losing the battle to feed itself.
If present trends continue, we can now see the point at which even our own vast productive resources, including the millions of acres of farmlands that we now hold in reserve, will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of human beings for food.
In my Food for Freedom message that the President sent to the Congress, I requested the authority and the funds to provide food on very special terms to those countries that are willing to increase their own production.
We will lend America's technical knowledge.
We will lend America's practical experience to those people who need it most and who are willing to prove to us that they are willing to try to help themselves.
In addition to that, we will support programs of capital investment, water development, farm machinery, pesticides, seed research, and fertilizer.
We will introduce all the American know-how in their country to try to help them learn to produce the food that is necessary to satisfy the human bodies that live in their land.
Now these are only beginnings.
We must work for a global effort.
Hunger knows no ideology.
Hunger knows no single race or no single nationality, no partyDemocratic or Republican.
We recognize the contributions of the Soviet Union.
We recognize the contributions of Yugoslavia in contributing food to India.
We are glad that they saw fit to try to do their part.
We welcome the support of every nation in the world when that support is given to feeding hungry human beings.
In this kind of cooperation we find the seeds of unity against the common enemies of all mankind.
I long for the day when we and others-whatever their political creedwill turn our joint resources to the battle against poverty, ignorance, and disease.
Because I honestly believe that these enemiespoverty and ignorance and diseaseare the enemies of peace in the world.
But that day is not here because some men, in some places, still insist on trying to force their way of life on other people.
That is the second threat that I want to talk about out here in Omaha today.
That is the second threat to peacetrying to force their way of life on other people.
That is the threat that we are standing up to with our proud sailors, soldiers, airmen, and Marines in South Vietnam at this hour.
Now I want to point out to you that the conflict there is important for many reasons, but I have time to mention only a few.
I am going to mention three specifically.
The first reason: We believe that the rights of other people are just as important as our own.
We believe that we are obligated to help those whose rights are being threatened by brute force.
Individuals can never escape a sense of decency and respect for others; neither can democratic nations.
If one man here in Omaha unlawfully forces another to do what he commands, then you rebel against the injustice, because you know it is wrong for one man here in Omaha to force another one to do what he wants him to do.
Unless human concern has disappeared from all of our values, you also know that it is necessaryI emphasize necessaryto help that man that is being forced to defend himself.
This same principle is true for nations nations which live by respect of the rights of others.
If one government uses force to violate another people's rights, we cannot ignore the injustice, the threat to our own rights, the danger to peace in the entire world.
That is what is happening at this hour in South Vietnam.
The North Vietnamese are trying to deny the people of South Vietnam the right to build their own nation, the right to choose their own system of government, the right to live and to work in peace.
To those people in America who say they have never had this thing explained to them, I want to repeat that again.
The North Vietnamese at this hour are trying to deny the people of South Vietnam the right to build their own nation, the right to choose their own system of government, the right to go and vote in a free election and select their own people, the right to live and work in peace.
South Vietnam has asked us for help.
Only if we abandon our respect for the rights of other people could we turn down their plea.
Second, South Vietnam is important to the security of the rest of all of Asia.
A few years ago the nations of free Asia lay under the shadow of Communist China.
They faced a common threat, but not in unity.
They were still caught up in their old disputes and dangerous confrontations.
They were ripe for aggression.
Now that picture is changing.
Shielded by the courage of the South Vietnamese, the peoples of free Asia today are driving toward economic and social development in a new spirit of regional cooperation.
All you have to do is look at that map and you will see independence growing, thriving, blossoming, and blooming.
They are convinced that the Vietnamese people and their allies are going to stand firm against the conqueror, or against aggression.
Our fighting in Vietnam, therefore, is buying time not only for South Vietnam, but it is buying time for a new and a vital, growing Asia to emerge and develop additional strength.
If South Vietnam were to collapse under Communist pressure from the North, the progress in the rest of Asia would be greatly endangered.
And do not you forget that!The third reason is, what happens in South Vietnam will determineyes, it will determinewhether ambitious and aggressive nations can use guerrilla warfare to conquer their weaker neighbors.
It will determine whether might makes right.
Now I do not know of a single more important reason for our presence than this.
We are fighting in South Vietnam a different kind of war than we have ever known in the past.
Sixteen years ago this month, North Korea attacked South Korea.
By armed invasion across a national border, a Communist country attempted to conquer and overrun its neighbor.
The United States of America recognized this kind of aggression immediately and we acted.
North Korean aggression failed.
Why? Because President Harry S.
Truman and the American people, working with the forces of the United Nations, supporting that great leader, had the courage to help the people of South Korea protect their homes and protect their country.
Those people are helping us in Vietnam now.
Today South Korea is still free and thousands of its young men are again fighting side by side with the Americans to defend another small country from being swallowed up by a more powerful Communist neighbor.
Today in South Vietnam we are witness to another kind of armed aggression.
It is a war that is waged by men who believe that subversion and guerrilla warfare, transported across international boundaries, can achieve what conventional armies could not.
They believe that in the long run a modern scientific and industrial nation such as ours is helpless to defend a smaller and weaker country against the imported terror of guerrilla warfare.
That is what is going on there.
The Communist guerrillas, the Vietcong, choose their targets carefully.
They aim at the heart of a struggling nation by murdering the schoolteachers, by murdering the agricultural extension workers, by killing the health workers, by assassinating the mayors and their families.
In 1965 alone the Communists killed or kidnaped 12,000 South Vietnamese civilians.
That is equivalent to wiping out the entire population of Columbus, Nebraska, or Alliance County, or one out of every 25 citizens that live in this great city of Omaha.
If, by such methods, the agents of one nation can go out and hold and seize power where turbulent change is occurring in another nation, our hope for peace and order will suffer a crushing blow all over the world.
It will be an invitation to the would-be conqueror to keep on marching.
That is why the problem of guerrilla warfare-the problem of Vietnamis a very critical threat to peace not just in South Vietnam, but in all of this world in which we live.
Let there be no doubt about it: Those who say this is merely a South Vietnamese civil war could not be more wrong.
The warfare in South Vietnam was started by the Government of North Vietnam in 1959.
It is financed, it is supported, by an increasing flow of men and arms from the North into the South.
It is directed and it is led by a skilled professional staff of North Vietnamese, and it is supported by a very small minority of the population of South Vietnam.
The military tactics are different.
The nature of the fighting is different.
But the objective is the same as we found it in Korea.
The objective is what? The objective is to conquer an independent nation by the force and power of arms.
Might makes right, so think these Communist invaders.
Well, the war took a new turn in 1964.
The North Vietnamese decided to step up the conflict in the hope of an early victory.
They recruited and drafted more young men from the Communist areas in the South.
They slipped across the borders of South Vietnam more than three divisions of the North Vietnamese Regular Army.
Today there are more than three North Vietnamese divisions fighting in South Vietnam.
They built all-weather roads.
The trails turned into boulevards to replace the jungle trails that they had once used.
They began sending troops in by trucks rather than on foot.
They shifted over to heavy weapons, using imported ammunition, most of it coming from Communist China.
By any definition you want to useany definitionany lawyer can tell you this: This is armed aggression, the philosophy that might makes right.
Well, America's purpose is to convince North Vietnam that this kind of aggression is too costly, that this kind of power cannot succeed.
We have learned from their prisoners, their defectors, and their captured documents that the Hanoi government really thought a few months ago that conquest was in its grasp.
But the free men have rallied to prevent this conquest from succeeding.
In the past 15 months our actions and those of our fighting allies of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, and the courage of the people of South Vietnam, have already begun to turn the tide.
The casualties of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese forces are three times larger than those of the South Vietnamese and their allies.
Battle after battle is being won by the South Vietnamese and by the troops under that gallant leader from the United States of America, General Westy Westmoreland.
He is getting some military advice on the side from some of our armchair generals in the United States, but it looks to me like he is doing pretty good using his own judgment.
The air attacks on military targets in North Vietnam have imposed, and will continue to impose, a growing burden and a high price on those who wage war against the freedom of their neighbors.
In the South the Vietnamese are determined that their own economic development, their own social reform and political progress cannot wait until the war ends, so they are now moving toward constitutional government.
For the past 2 months the political struggles in South Vietnam have been dramatized in our newspapers.
They have been published on our television screen every day.
But all during this time, the Vietnamese citizens, representing every important group in the society, have been quietly meeting in orderly assembly.
They have formulated rules for their elections.
The rules have been accepted with only minor modifications by the government in Saigon.
And in the provinces and villages, the Vietnamese have gone on building schools for their children, improving health facilities and agricultural methods, and taking the first steps toward land reform.
So we can take heart from all of this.
We are backing the Vietnamese not only in their determination to save their country; we are supporting their determination to build, to construct, a modern society in which the government will be their government, reflecting the will of the people of South Vietnam.
Our objective in Vietnam is not war.
Our objective is peace.
There is nothing that we want in North Vietnam.
There is nothing we want from North Vietnam.
There is nothing that we want in Communist China.
There is nothing the American people want from Communist China.
We have made it very clear by every means at our disposal that we wish the killing to stop.
We have made it very clear that we wish negotiations to begin on the basis of international agreements made in 1954 and 1962.
For 37 long days we halted bombing in the North in the hope that the government in Hanoi would signal its willingness to talk instead of fight.
But I regret to tell you that no signal came during those 37 days.
In many more ways than I can now tell you here in Omaha, we have explored and we are continuing to explore avenues to peace with North Vietnam.
But as of this moment, their only reply has been to send more troops and to send more guns into the South.
Until the day they decide to end this aggression and to make an honorable peace, I can assure you that we, speaking for the United States of America, intend to carry on.
No one knows how long it will take.
Only Hanoi can be the judge of that.
No one can tell you how much effort it will take.
None can tell you how much sacrifice it will take.
No one can tell you how costly it will be.
But I can, and I do here and now, tell you this: The aggression that they are conducting will not succeed.
The people of South Vietnam will be given the chance to work out their own destiny in their own way, and not at the point of a bayonet or with a gun at their temple.
I hear my friends say, I am troubled, I am confused, I am frustrated, and all of us can understand those people.
Sometimes I almost develop a stomach ulcer myself, just listening to them.
We all wish the war would end.
We all wish the troops would come home.
But I want to see the alternatives and the calculations that they have to present that give them a better chance to get the troops home than the very thing we are doing.
There is no human being in all this world who wishes these things to happenfor peace to come to the worldmore than your President of the United States.
If you are too busy, or not inclined to help, please count 10 before you hurt.
Because we must have no doubt today about the determination of the American men wearing American uniforms, the Marines who are out there fighting in the wet jungles, wading through the rice paddies up to their belts, the sailors who are searching the shores and patrolling the seas, the airmen who are out there facing the missiles and the antiaircraft guns, carrying out their mission, trying to protect your liberty.
The least they are entitled to is for you to be as brave as they are and to stand up and give them the support they need here at home.
These men are not going to fail us.
Now the real question is: Are we going to fail them? Our staying power is what counts in the long and dangerous months ahead.
The Communists expect us to lose heart.
The Communists expect to wear us down.
The Communists expect to divide this Nation.
The Communists are not happy about the military defeat they are taking in South Vietnam.
But sometimes they do get encouraged, as they said this week, about the dissension in the United States of America.
They believe that the political disagreements in Washington, the confusion and doubt in the United States, will hand them a victory on a silver platter in Southeast Asia.
Well, if they think that, they are wrong.
To those who would try to pressure us or influence us, mislead us or deceive us, I say this afternoon, there can be only one decision in Vietnam, and that is this: We will see this through.
We shall persist.
We shall succeed.
Other Presidents have made the commitment.
I have reaffirmed it.
The Congress has confirmed it.
I plan to do all that I can in my own limited way to see that we not permit 14 million innocent men, women, and children to fall victims to a savage aggression.
There are many nations, large and small, whose security depends on the reliability of the word and the reliability of the power of the United States.
The word of the United States must remain a trust that men can live by, can live with, and can depend upon.
Some day we will all work as friends and neighbors to grow more food, to build more schools, to heal the sick, to care for the old, to encourage the young.
We have programs in that direction in the United States going on now, and we are not going to junk them.
But we are not going to tuck our tail and run out of South Vietnam either.
History is not made by nameless forces.
History is made by men and women, by their governments and their nations.
This Nation, working with others, must demonstrate in Vietnam that our commitment to freedom and peace is not a fragile thing.
It canand it willsustain the major test and any test that may confront it.
With your supportwith your faithwe will fulfill America's duty.
We have a proud and a glorious heritage.
We are going to be true to it.
It was only 20 months ago that the people of America held a great national election.
The people of 44 States of this Union, including the great State of Nebraska, gave me a direction and voted me a majority for the Presidency of this country.
I believe that their vote was a trust, that as long as I held this high and most responsible office and gift of the American people, that I would do my best as President of the country, as Commander in Chief of the Army.
Now, there are many, many who can recommend, advise, and sometimes a few of them consent.
But there is only one that has been chosen by the American people to decide.
With your support, with your prayers, with your faith, I intend to honor the responsibility and to be true to the trust of the office to which you elected me, and to preserve freedom in this country; to keep our commitments; to honor our treaties; and let the rest of the world know that when America gives its word, America keeps its word.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen: Governor John Reed of Maine, who is Chairman of the National Governors' Conference, has requested that I send a team of U.
S.
officials to brief the Governors on current developments in Vietnam.
He sent me a wire last evening to which I have already responded.
I am asking Ambassador Averell Harriman, Gen.
Andy Goodpaster of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  Walt Rostow of the White House to go to Los Angeles for that purpose.
They will stop here Wednesday for an overnight stay before going to Los Angeles.
I also asked General Goodpaster to talk to President Eisenhower and to give him a full report on current developments in Vietnam.
He has just informed me that he has done that this afternoon.
I am asking this team to report in detail to the Governors on the progress that is being made to achieve a better life among the South Vietnamese people.
I consider this other war as crucial to the the future of South Vietnam and Southeast Asia as the military struggle.
Already American assistance has added some 600,000 acres of irrigated land to the agriculture of South Vietnam.
It has vastly increased crop yields in that country.
Under new land reform measures, a half million acres of land are being sold now to small farmers on easy terms.
Another 700,000 acres of State-owned land will soon be distributed, I am told, to landless refugees from areas that have been controlled by the Vietcong.
Fish production has been more than doubled in the past 5 years.
Almost 13,000 village health stations have been established and stocked with medicine from the United States.
We are helping to build a medical school which will graduate as many doctors every year as now serve the entire civilian population of that area of 14 million people.
Primary and secondary school enrollment in South Vietnam has increased five times.
By 1968, 13,000 new village classrooms will have been built to provide for over three-quarters of a million young schoolchildren.
We have helped to distribute 7 million textbooks in the.
past 3 years and we are providing 1,700 new teachers every year.
More than 10,000 Vietnamese are now receiving vocational training as a result of the program we have laid out in that country.
I believe this is a good record.
It's a record I would like the American people to know more about.
I hope that they will study it, observe it, give us their suggestions in the days to come.
We have not waited for the fighting to end before we have the beginnings of the works of peace.
We are even now attacking with all of our strength the basic problems in Vietnamilliteracy, poverty, disease.
It is these problems that bring on the wars.
We must continue to press this battle forward, and we will do so.
Komer, my Special Assistant in charge of this work, has just returned from South Vietnam with this report that I have summarized briefly for you.
I have asked Secretary McNamara to stop here tomorrow to discuss with me various matters prior to his meeting in Honolulu Friday with Admiral Sharp, Commander in Chief of the Pacific.
During his 1-day meeting in Hawaii, Secretary McNamara will receive from Admiral Sharp a report on the program of military operations in Southeast Asia and will discuss logistical plans for future operations.
Clark Clifford, Chairman of the President's Advisory Board on Foreign Intelligence, will be coming to the ranch later today to review intelligence matters with me, and will stay overnight here at the ranch.
I am nominating  Robert B.
Bowie to be Counselor of the Department of State.
Bowie is professor of international relations and director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University.
He has a distinguished record in the military service and in foreign policy and as a scholar in the field of international affairs.
He will be a very valuable new member of the foreign policy advisers who serve the President and who serve this Nation.
Today I am nominating four new judges: Donald P.
Lay of Omaha, to the U.
S.
Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit.
Walter J.
Cummings, , of Chicago, to the U.
S.
Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit.
Thomas E.
Fairchild, of Milwaukee, to the U.
S.
Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit.
Theodore Cabot, of Fort Lauderdale, to be U.
S.
district judge for the southern district of Florida.
I am pleased also to make the following announcements of my intention to send these nominations to the Senate: Wilfred Johnson, of Richland, Washington, to be a member of the Atomic Energy Commission.
Johnson has been general manager of General Electric's nuclear activities at Hanford, Washington.
He has been strongly recommended by the members of the Commission and by members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in the Congress.
Paul Miller, president of the University of West Virginia, to be the new Assistant Secretary for Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Frank DiLuzio, Director of the Office of Saline Water, to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior in charge of our very new and important water pollution program that is in that Department.
I had the pleasure of visiting with the Vice President by telephone this morning and tie reported to me on his trip to the Dominican Republic where he represented our country at the inauguration of the new President that the people of that country have selected,  Balaguer.
He had high praise for the people and the leaders of the Dominican Republic for their perseverance and faith during the past year of this great crisis.
He said the recent elections represent not only a respect for constitutional government, but the desire of the Dominican people for peace and tranquility.
I asked the Vice President to discuss with  Balaguer the economic assistance which the United States has been providing the Dominican Republic in the past, and to analyze the future needs of that economy.
Balaguer and his government face staggering problems.
I think you would be interested in knowing that approximately 25 percent of the working force in the Dominican Republic is presently unemployed.
The Vice President reports that the Dominican Government is moving to face these problems forcefully, and he believes effectively.
I will discuss the Vice President's report with Secretary Rusk and other officials to make certain we are doing everything we can to assist the courageous people of the Dominican Republic.
Rostow is already analyzing and evaluating the Vice President's report and will have recommendations for me when he arrives tomorrow.
They seem determined to make constitutional government work in the Dominican Republic and to improve the well-being of every citizen.
I know that all Americans wish them well.
I have today received from Secretary McNamara an appraisal of the efficiency of the buildup of the United States forces in Vietnam.
I am pleased, as his report indicates that he will attempt to reduce the planned rates of production substantially 90 to 180 days from now.
In the report to the President by Secretary McNamara he says:Approximately 1 year ago the buildup of our forces in Vietnam was initiated at your direction.
I believe it is timely, he says, to report to you the results of that action.
First, I would point out that never before in our history has it been possible to accomplish such a rapid and such an effective expansion of our Armed Forces without the need to mobilize the Reserve forces, and to call up the Reserves, to impose stringent economic controls and emergency controls on our economy, or to require involuntary extensions of active duty throughout the services.
As Commander in Chief, you have reason to be proud of the magnificent professional leadership which our men in Vietnam are receiving from General William C.
Westmoreland, his officers, and his noncommissioned officers and men.
This matchless leadership is paralleled by the fact that no military force has been so well supplied.
Despite the fact that we deployed a military force of more than 100,000 men within 120 days and sent them halfway around the world, we have been able to keep that force constantly supplied and equipped so that at all times they have been capable of bringing to bear their full power against the aggressor.
As General Earle G.
Wheeler, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has reported:'There have been no shortages in supplies for the troops in Vietnam which have adversely affected combat operations or the health or welfare of our troops.
No required air sorties have been canceled.
As a matter of fact, the air support given our forces is without parallel in our history.
'With ample inventory stocks still on hand, our production of ammunition and air ordnance this month will exceed our consumption this month.
Indeed, says Secretary McNamara, I believe it may very well prove desirable to reduce planned rates of production substantially.
Such action would be in keeping with your insistence that the Department of Defense make certain that all military requirements are fulfilled, while achieving this objective with maximum economy for our taxpayers.
By continuing to carefully adjust expenditures and production and by resisting the temptation to ask for more money and to spend more money than we need, I believe, says the Secretary, we can avoid the carryover that was represented by $12 billion of surplus and worthless materiel with which we concluded the Korean war.
Our buildup has been responsive.
It has been forceful, and it has been effective.
Just one brief note in conclusion: While final figures on the receipts and expenditures for fiscal 1966 which ended June 30th are not yet available, it is very clear to me this morning, after a conference with the Chairman of the President's Economic Advisers and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, that the administrative budget deficit for this year will be very substantially below the $5.
3 billion originally estimated in January 1965, and far below the $6.
4 billion forecast this past January.
This marks the third straight year in which the actual deficit has been lower than what the President predicted.
In fiscal 1964 the actual deficit was $3.
7 billion below what the President promised the Congress in his estimate.
In 1965 it was $1 1/2 billion below what the President had recommended in his estimate.
We will not know the final 1966 figures for several weeks, but it is already clear that the reduction in the deficit below our original estimate of 18 months ago will be greater than we achieved in 1965.
In the 10 years prior to fiscal 1964, the actual budget outcome averaged $2.
9 billion worse than the original predicted figure.
I believe the fiscal outcome for the past year and for the previous years for which I am responsible demonstrates three things: First, we have tried to make a realistic estimate of both our revenues and expenditures, and to be conservative and careful in those estimates.
Second, we have made an unremitting effort to hold our expenditures wherever possible at or below our initial estimates.
I am proud to tell you that I believe that will be done so far as domestic expenditures are concerned this year by several hundred millions of dollars.
Third, we have maintained the strength and health of our economy so that revenues each year have exceeded our estimates for that year, which the Budget Director tells me is somewhat unusual.
We are determined to maintain a sound and a healthy economy which will provide the revenues that we will need to meet our responsibilities in the years ahead.
Now I will be glad to take your questions if you have any.
The evaluations that we have, and they are still coming inwe have new pictures that are being analyzed at this momentthe evaluations that we have indicate that about 86 percent of the known petroleum storage capacity in North Vietnam was hit the other evening in a very accurate target operation over the POL targets in the vicinity of Hanoi and Haiphong.
The latest estimate of the storage capacity actually destroyed that has come in from the field is 57 percent.
In other words, 86 percent of the storage was hit; 57 percent they estimate is destroyed.
I cannot embrace those figures because the pictures are not complete.
But the general officers who have reviewed this told me this morning that they think both estimates are within reason, and they think it was a very successful operation.
I think that every general officer carrying responsibilities, either in Vietnam or in the Pentagon, as well as most of our career, experienced, diplomatic observers, think that this action at this time was required by the events of the time.
We have developed the best system that we have known how to, in the light of our experiences.
We have asked the Pentagon to review it from their standpoint, and they have done so.
They are now presenting their views to the appropriate committees in the Congress.
I have asked some of our most distinguished citizens Burke Marshall, former Assistant Attorney General;  Thomas Gates, former Secretary of Defense under General Eisenhower;  Oveta Culp Hobby, former Director of the WACS and a Cabinet officer under General Eisenhower-and some of the best talent in this Nation to review all the alternatives available to a country which finds it necessary to draft its young men.
I do not want to prejudge that study.
That study is in the process of being made.
We will have a very competent staff.
We expect to have some conclusions and some recommendations to present to the next session of Congress in ample time for them to carefully consider before the present draft law expires.
No, I would not make such an evaluation.
I would say so far as ammunition is concerned the Secretary hopes that within 90 to 180 days he can make some recommendations.
I think it is his feeling that those recommendations that he will make, which will have the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will result in the saving of several hundreds of millions of dollars over what the cost would be at the present rate.
That is not to indicate, though, that we will not call up additional men; that we will not train additional men; that we will not procure additional planes; that we will not procure additional helicopters; that we will not send additional people overseasbecause we will do all of those things.
But we are watching it very carefully so we will not have a $12 billion holdover at the end of the difficulties in Vietnam.
Yes.
We regret the action that took place in Argentina recently.
We have had similar actions of that type in the last year, two or three instances.
They are less in the last few months than they have been heretofore.
We are very encouraged by what has happened generally in Latin America.
We are very proud of our record of growth there.
We are spending about a billion dollars, or a little in excess of a billion dollars, in our Alliance for Progress program in Latin America.
We find the per capita growth rate has jumped from 1 percent to in excess of 2 1/2 percent.
That already equals and exceeds the goals that we had set for the Alliance for Progress.
Notwithstanding the grave predictions made and the discouragement that the Dominican people received from many quarters, they have had a peaceful election.
A majority of the people have exercised their democratic right to select a government of their own choosing.
They have selected that government.
They have just finished a similar exercise in Guatemala, and some four or five additional Latin American nations.
We would say, as we look around the world, at this hemisphere, Latin America, the prosperity, the democratic evolution that is taking place, when we look over Africa, look over Southeast Asia generally-with the exception of our problem in Vietnamwhen we take a look at the Middle East and Western Europe, we have much to be thankful for, generally speaking, much to be encouraged about.
Now I find that true and that to be the judgment of most of our experienced career diplomats.
We think that on practically every continentwhen you look back at Africa just a few months ago, at the serious problems we had in the Congo, and so forth, you look at the Dominican Republic, the Panama situation, the difficulties we had in Brazil, the problems in Chilewe have made great progress and generally speaking we are optimistic about most of the continents.
If we could only solve the problem in Vietnam, and we think we are on the way to doing that, we could have a world that is rather peaceful and generally prosperous.
Well, I think we all read them and are affected by them.
We of course would like for every poll to be of our liking.
We like to feel that all of them are accurate.
We have had a dozen polls, I guess, in the last week.
You do not read about the favorable ones, though, I have observed.
Gallup reported last week that we had gained 4 percent.
Harris reports today that we have about 55 percent of the total in the country.
Quayle has made a nationwide survey and he shows about 55 percent.
Now that is what you reported as a landslide during General Eisenhower's period.
Our poll in California shows a very healthy majority for approval of our record.
We believe that it will show the same thing in Iowa.
Those are the only two polls that you have cited.
We have a number of them that come to us each day.
If you are interested in them I will see that  Moyers makes them available to you.
Maine shows 57-43 percent.
That is unusual for a Democratic administration.
New Hampshire, 53-47; New Jersey, 7624; Michigan, 62-38.
Although Governor Romney has a substantial majority of the Democrats favoring his record as Governor, we lead Governor Romney in his own State.
In Tennessee it is 61-39.
That is considerably better than we were in 1964.
Virginia is 53-47; Texas, 58-42.
We have a good many polls from all over the country.
They are not disturbing to us.
We think that a 55 percent rating in the countrythat is the landslide that General Eisenhower defeated  Adlai Stevenson by.
So we are not upset.
We would all like to have as much approval as we can get.
But we have to make our judgments and do what we think is right.
Then we trust the judgment of the people at election time.
I have not the slightest doubt but what they will exercise good judgment.
I think our boys under General Westmoreland, his staff officers and the men they are leading, are doing an exceptionally fine job.
I want to encourage them in every way I can.
I want to support them in every way I can.
I am fearful that sometimes we do not give enough thought to those men as we sit here in the luxury of our front porch and our lawn, that we do not recognize the men that are dying for us out in the rice paddies.
I do not think you can speak too well of them.
Their record has been outstanding.
Their results are very good.
Our diplomatic reports indicate that the opposing forces no longer really expect a military victory in South Vietnam.
I am aware of the dangers of speculation.
You do not pay me anything extra for it.
So I am not going to guess for you.
Suffice it to say, I am proud of what the men are doing.
If everyone in this country was working as hard to support the principles of democracy as the men in Vietnam are, I think we would have little to worry about.
Yes.
First of all, all the Communist countries, generally speaking, opposed it rather vehemently.
Some of them were rather vicious in their statements, and I think inaccurate, that we were bombing civilian targets and killing civilians.
We were very careful to select military targets that were not in the center of the area and to spare all civilians.
We took every precaution available to us.
I cannot understand the thinking of any country or any people, or any person, that says we should sit by with our hands tied behind us while these men bring their mortars, their hand grenades and their bombs into our barracks and kill our Marines, attack our camps, murder the village chief, and that we should not do anything about it.
Now we have tried to make this difficult for them to continue at their present rate.
We do not say it will stop the infiltration.
We do not say that it will even reduce it.
But we do think it will make it more difficult for them, and we do think it will require them to assign additional people.
We do think it will give them problems.
We have had a policy of measured response and gradually increased our strength from time to time.
We plan to continue that.
Most of the Communist countries expressed disapproval.
Most of the countries in the area involved, and all of the countries who have bodies there, who have men in uniform there, approved our action.
It is difficult for me to understand the response of some nation that is not involved, when a few years ago when their own security was at stake they needed American men and they wanted us to furnish American troops, not to be understanding of what we are trying to do to help others maintain their independence now.
I would say that we had very encouraging reports from a good many of our allies.
We were disappointed in a few.
We expected the regular Communist response, namely, that this would harden the opposition, and that it would not lead to negotiations; that we were killing civilians; and that we were not bombing military targets.
But all those things we considered in advance.
And we think we pursued the right course.
Since you are talking about polls, I am informed today that the national polls show that 85 percent of the people of this country approved this position.
I think we did the right thing at the right time.
I hope that we can continue to be as successful in the days ahead in connection with General Westmoreland's operations as we were in this particular exercise.
Yes.
We are trying in every way we can to find employment for the unemployed in our cities.
We are trying in every way we can to get people to quit practicing discrimination in our cities.
We are trying to meet the poverty situation as we find it with the limited resources at our command.
We are not interested in black power and we are not interested in white power.
But we are interested in American democratic power, with a small d.
We believe that the citizen ought to be armed with the power to vote.
We believe the citizen, regardless of his race or his religion or color, ought to be armed with the right to have a job at decent wages.
We believe that every citizen ought to have the right to have a decent home.
We are doing everything we can, as quickly as we can, under our voters rights bill, under our civil rights bills, under our housing bills, under proposals we have made in cooperation with the mayors under the able leadership of the Vice President, to improve these terrible conditions that exist in the ghettos of this country.
Now we cannot do it all overnight.
We are much too late.
But we have done more in the last 24 months than has been done in any similar 24-year period to face up to these conditions of health, education, poverty, and discrimination.
We are going to continue as long as I am President to do everything we can to see that all citizens are treated equally and have equal opportunities.
When we achieve that, I think we will find a good deal of the solution to the problem which you mentioned.
I have not read the Paris magazines.
No, we do not think so.
We are doing everything we can to reach an agreement on such a treaty.
We are very anxious to do it.
We hope the Soviet Union will meet us and find an acceptable compromise in language which we can both live with.
They have some problems at the moment, but we are going to live up to the test ban treaty, religiously and scrupulously follow it.
We are going to do everything within the power of our most imaginative people to find language which will bring the nuclear powers together in a treaty which will provide nonproliferation.
We think it is one of the most important decisions of our time and we are going to do everything to bring people together on it.
No.
I think you will see a good deal of me this year.
I have been in about 10 States in the last several weeks.
I expect to get around the country and talk to the people about our problems and our programs.
But I have no announcements to make about my own future except to say I am going to do my dead-level best to serve all the people of this country.
We have a legislative program yet to be acted on.
We have more than half of it already enacted.
We had about 85 percent of it enacted last year.
We hope to get a substantial part of it completed in the next few months.
As time permits, I will be traveling throughout the country.
I have been in the States of New York, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, Virginia, Maryland, Iowa, and New Jersey all in the last 3 or 4 weeks.
At that rate, we could cover all 50 of them between now and, say, late October.
Thank you,  President.
Ladies and gentlemen:I wanted very much to be in West Virginia tonight to speak to the American Alumni Council.
What the weather has prevented, however, the miracle of electronics has made possible.
I am happy to be speaking to you tonight from here in the White House.
In a very special way, this is really your house.
I have great respect for the work that you do.
My own career owes a large debt to men and women like you, who have made it possible for the young people of our country to learn.
I know what alumni mean to the support of higher education.
Last year alumni contributed almost $300 million to the colleges and universities of this Nation.
As the father of two daughters, and as the President of a country in which more than half of our citizens are now under 25 years of age, I think I know how important that assistance is to the youth of this Nation.
Throughout my entire life I have taken seriously the warning that the world is engaged in a race between education and chaos.
For the last 2 1/2 years I have lived here with the daily awareness that the fate of mankind really depends on the outcome of that race.
So I came here tonight because you are committed in the name of education to help us decide that contest.
And that is the most important victory we can ever win.
We have set out in this country to improve the quality of all American life.
We are concerned with each man's opportunity to develop his talents.
We are concerned with his environment-the cities and the farms where he lives, the air he breathes, the water he drinks.
We seek to enrich the schools that educate him and, of course, to improve the governments that serve him.
We are at war against the poverty that deprives him, the unemployment that degrades him, and the prejudice that defies him.
As we look at other parts of the world, we see similar battles being fought in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.
On every hand we see the thirst for independence, the struggle for progress-the almost frantic race that is taking place between education, on the one hand, and disaster on the other.
In all these regions we, too, have a very big stake.
And nowhere are the stakes higher than Asia.
So I want to talk to you tonight about Asia and about peace in Asia.
Asia is now the crucial arena of man's striving for independence and order, and for life itself.
This is true because three out of every five people in all this world live in Asia tonight.
This is true because hundreds of millions of them exist on less than 25 cents a day.
And this is true because Communists in tonight still believe in force in order achieve their Communist goals.
So if enduring peace can ever come to Asia, all mankind will benefit.
But if peace fails there, nowhere else will our achievements really be secure.
By peace in Asia I do not mean simply the absence of armed hostilities.
For wherever men hunger and hate there can really be no peace.
I do not mean the peace of conquest.
For humiliation can be the seedbed of war.
I do not mean simply the peace of the conference table.
For peace is not really written merely in the words of treaties, but peace is the day-by-day work of builders.
So the peace we seek in Asia is a peace of conciliation between Communist states and their non-Communist neighbors; between rich nations and poor; between small nations and large; between men whose skins are brown and black and yellow and white; between Hindus and Moslems and Buddhists and Christians.
It is a peace that can only be sustained through the durable bonds of peace, and through international trade, and through the free flow of peoples and ideas, and through full participation by all nations in an international community under law, and through a common dedication to the great tasks of human progress and economic development.
Is such a peace possible?With all my heart I believe that it is.
We are not there yet.
We have a long way to journey.
But the foundations for such a peace in Asia are being laid tonight as never before.
They must be built on these essentials:First is the determination of the United States to meet our obligations in Asia as a Pacific power.
You have heard arguments the other way.
They are built on the old belief that East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet;-that we have no business but business interests in Asia;-that Europe, not the Far East, is really our proper sphere of interest;-that our commitments in Asia are not worth the resources that they require;-that the ocean is vast, the cultures alien, the languages strange, and the races different;-that these really are not our kind of people.
But all of these arguments have been thoroughly tested.
And all of them, I think, have really been found wanting.
They do not stand the test of geography-because we are bounded not by one, but by two oceans.
And whether by aircraft or ship, by satellite or missile, the Pacific is as crossable as the Atlantic.
They do not stand the test of common sense.
The economic network of this shrinking globe is too intertwined, the basic hopes of men are too interrelated, the possibility of common disaster is too real for us to ever ignore threats to peace in Asia.
They do not stand the test of human concern, either.
The people of Asia do matter.
We share with them many things in common.
We are all persons.
We are all human beings.
And they do not stand the test of reality, either.
Asia is no longer sitting outside the door of the 20th century.
She is here in the same world with all of us-to be either our partner or our problem.
Americans entered this century believing that our own security had no foundation outside our own continent.
Twice we mistook our sheltered position for safety.
Twice we were dead wrong.
And if we are wise now, we will not repeat our mistakes of the past.
We will not retreat from the obligations of freedom and security in Asia.
The second essential for peace in Asia is this: to prove to aggressive nations that the use of force to conquer others is really a losing game.
There is no more difficult task, really, in a world of revolutionary change-where the rewards of conquest tempt ambitious appetites.
As long as the leaders of North Vietnam really believe that they can take over the people of South Vietnam by force, we just must not let them succeed.
We must stand across their path and say: You will not prevail; but turn from the use of force and peace will follow.
Every American must know exactly what it is that we are trying to do in Vietnam.
Our greatest resource, really, in this conflict-our greatest support for the men who are fighting out there-is your understanding.
It is your willingness to carry, perhaps for a long time, the heavy burden of a confusing and costly war.
We are not trying to wipe out North Vietnam.
We are not trying to change their government.
We are not trying to establish permanent bases in South Vietnam.
And we are not trying to gain one inch of new territory for America.
Then, you say, Why are we there? Why?Well, we are there because we are trying to make the Communists of North Vietnam stop shooting at their neighbors:-because we are trying to make this Communist aggression unprofitable;-because we are trying to demonstrate that guerrilla warfare, inspired by one nation against another nation, just can never succeed.
Once that lesson is learned, a shadow that hangs over all of Asia tonight will, I think, begin to recede.
Well, you say, when will that day come? I am sorry, I cannot tell you.
Only the men in Hanoi can give you that answer.
We are fighting a war of determination.
It may last a long time.
But we must keep on until the Communists in North Vietnam realize the price of aggression is too high-and either agree to a peaceful settlement or to stop their fighting.
However long it takes, I want the Communists in Hanoi to know where we stand.
First, victory for your armies is impossible.
You cannot drive us from South Vietnam by your force.
Do not mistake our firm stand for false optimism.
As long as you persist in aggression, we are going to resist.
Second, the minute you realize that a military victory is out of the question and you turn from the use of force, you will find us ready and willing to reciprocate.
We want to end the fighting.
We want to bring our men back home.
We want an honorable peace in Vietnam.
In your hands is the key to that peace.
You have only to turn it.
The third essential is the building of political and economic strength among the nations of free Asia.
For years they have been working at that task.
And the untold story of 1966 is the story of what free Asians have done for themselves, and with the help of others, while South Vietnam and her allies have been busy holding aggression at bay.
Many of you can recall our faith in the future of Europe at the end of World War II when we began the Marshall plan.
We backed that faith with all the aid and compassion we could muster.
Well, our faith in Asia tonight is just as great.
And that faith is backed by judgment and by reason.
For if we stand firm in Vietnam against military conquest, we truly believe that the emerging order of hope and progress in Asia will continue to grow and to grow.
Our very able Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, has just returned from a trip through the Far East.
He told me yesterday afternoon of many of the heartening signs he saw as the people of Asia continue to work toward common goals.
And these are just some of them.
In the last year:-Japan and Korea have settled their long-standing disputes and established normal relations with promise for a closer cooperation;-One country after another has achieved rates of economic growth that are far beyond the most optimistic hopes we had a few years ago;-Indonesia and its more than 100 million people have already pulled back from the brink of communism and economic collapse;-Our friends in India and Pakistan-600 million strong-have ended a tragic conflict and have returned to the immense work of peace;-Japan has become a dramatic example of economic progress through political and social freedom and has begun to help others;-Communist China's policy of aggression by proxy is failing;-Nine Pacific nations-allies and neutrals, white and colored-came together on their own initiative to form an Asian and Pacific Council;-New and constructive groupings for economic cooperation are under discussion in Southeast Asia;-The billion dollar Asian Development Bank which I first mentioned in Baltimore in my televised speech a few months ago is already moving forward in Manila with the participation of more than 31 nations;-And the development of the Lower Mekong River Basin is going forward despite the war.
Throughout free Asia you can hear the echo of progress.
As one Malaysian leader said: Whatever our ethical, cultural, or religious backgrounds, the nations and peoples of Southeast Asia must pull together in the same broad sweep of history.
We must create with our own hands and minds a new perspective and a new framework.
And we must do it ourselves.
For this is the new Asia, and this is the new spirit we see taking shape behind our defense of South Vietnam.
Because we have been firm-because we have committed ourselves to the defense of one small country-other countries have taken new heart.
And I want to assure them tonight that we never intend to let you down.
America's word will always be good.
There is a fourth essential for peace in Asia which may seem the most difficult of all: reconciliation between nations that now call themselves enemies.
A peaceful mainland China is central to a peaceful Asia.
A hostile China must be discouraged from aggression.
A misguided China must be encouraged toward understanding of the outside world and toward policies of peaceful cooperation.
For lasting peace can never come to Asia as long as the 700 million people of mainland China are isolated by their rulers from the outside world.
We have learned in our relations with other such states that the weakness of neighbors is a temptation, and only firmness that is backed by power can really deter power that is backed by ambition.
But we have also learned that the greatest force for opening closed minds and opening closed societies is the free flow of ideas and people and goods.
For many years, now, the United States has attempted in vain to persuade the Chinese Communists to agree to an exchange of newsmen as one of the first steps to increased understanding between our people.
More recently, we have taken steps to permit American scholars, experts in medicine and public health, and other specialists to travel to Communist China.
And only today we, here in the Government, cleared a passport for a leading American businessman to exchange knowledge with Chinese mainland leaders in Red China.
All of these initiatives, except the action today, have been rejected by Communist China.
We persist because we know that hunger and disease, ignorance and poverty, recognize no boundaries of either creed or class or country.
We persist because we believe that even the most rigid societies will some day, one day awaken to the rich possibilities of a diverse world.
And we continue because we believe that cooperation, not hostility, is really the way of the future in the 20th century.
That day is not yet here.
It may be long in coming, but I tell you it is clearly on its way, because come it must.
Earlier this year the Foreign Minister of Singapore said that if the nations of the world could learn to build a truly world civilization in the Pacific through cooperation and peaceful competition, then-as our great President Theodore Roosevelt once remarked-this may be the greatest of all human eras-the Pacific era.
As a Pacific power we must help achieve that outcome.
Because it is a goal that is worthy of our American dreams and it is a goal that is worthy of the deeds of our brave men who are dying for us tonight.
So I say to you and I pledge to all those who are counting on us: You can depend upon us, because all Americans will do our part.
We feel very strongly, Frank, that these men, who are military men, who are carrying out military assignments in line of duty against military targets, are not war criminals and should not be treated as such.
We are ready, whenever the Hanoi government is ready, to sit down at a conference table under the sponsorship of the International Committee of the Red Cross, to discuss ways in which the Geneva Conventions of 1949 can be given fuller and more complete application in Vietnam.
We think that the thought that these American boys have committed war crimes is deplorable and repulsive.
Your Government has taken every step that it considers appropriate to see that proper representations on this subject have been made.
The United States has made clear to the Government of India and to all other governments that at any time the Government of North Vietnam is willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss ways and means of obtaining peace in the world, that on a few hours' notice the United States will be there.
My closest representative is ready and willing and anxious at any time to enter into those discussions.
I do not think that we should spend all of our time, though, examining what the Government of the United States might be willing to do without any regard to what the enemy might be willing to do.
We have stated again and again our desire to engage in unconditional discussions and I repeat them again today.
But we cannot talk about just half the war.
We should talk about all the war, and we have not the slightest indication that the other side is willing to make any concession, to take any action that would lead to the peace table.
And until there is some indication on their part, we, of course, would not expect to tie the hands of our men in Vietnam.
Yes.
Secretary Wirtz has made a statement, a rather strong statement, within the hour in connection with that controversy.
The President has followed the law.
We have taken every legal step that we could.
We appointed and convened a very fair and judicious Board of distinguished Americans who heard testimony that runs into the hundreds of pages, made proper recommendations and drew appropriate conclusions, and submitted them to the President.
My advisers examined those recommendations, and I, as President of this country, urged both labor and management to follow the Board's recommendations.
The Board recommended that the airlines pay approximately an additional $76 million in increased wages and benefits.
After some consideration, the management agreed to the Board's recommendations, but the union representatives refused.
We have no legal remedies left to us in the Government.
We have done all we can do under the law.
We are continuing to persuade the management and labor people to continue their discussions.
We are hopeful that they will continue those discussions and work around the clock, because the people of this country deserve to be served.
While we have no law that can force the men to go back to work, I think the patience of the American people is being tried.
And although the Government has done everything it can do to keep the mail moving, to serve the needs of defense, the time has come when a settlement is indicated.
We would hope that the parties would continue to bargain until a decision is reached.
We have had no indication that the government of Hanoi is open to any of the appeals or any of the suggestions that we have made from time to time.
We think that we have made very clear, through our emissaries and through governments who are talking to both parties, our desire to sit at the table and discuss any subject that the other side desires to discuss.
But we have received no response whatever that would indicate the willingness on the part of the other side to do this.
I would not want to go further on that, John, than I have gone.
I think the people of this country and the peaceful people of the world would find this action very revolting and repulsive, and would react accordingly.
Well, the answer to your first question is no.
The Omaha and Des Moines speeches did not change the consistent policy of this country that we have followed ever since I became President.
Second, I think that the important thing for all of us to remember is that we are ready and willing now, and have been, without any limitation whatever, to discuss any subject with the enemy at any time that he is willing to discuss it.
But, Ed, until he gives some indication that he will sit down and talk, I see nothing to be gained from these exploratory excursions.
I am very concerned about the conditions that exist in many of the large cities of this country during this summer.
I have talked to the Governors on that subject this morning, and I have been in touch with a number of the mayors in most recent days.
As I said in the previous press conference, I am not interested in black power or white power.
What I am concerned with is democratic power, with a small d.
I believe that if we are not to lose a great many of the gains that we have made in recent years in treating people equally in this country, giving them equality in opportunity, equality in education, and equality in employment, then we must recognize that while there is a Negro minority of 10 percent in this country, there is a majority of 90 percent who are not Negroes.
But I believe most of those 90 percent have come around to the viewpoint of wanting to see equality and justice given their fellow citizens.
Now they want to see it done under the law and they want to see it done orderly.
They want to see it done without violence.
I hope that the lawfully constituted authorities of this country, as well as every citizen of this country, will obey the law, will not resort to violence, will do everything they can to cooperate with constituted authority to see that the evil conditions are remedied, that equality is given, and that progress is made.
And I shah do everything within my power to see that that is done.
Sid Davis, Westinghouse Broadcasting:  President, does the administration have any information that the current wave of riots are the work of professional agitators who want to foment trouble in our major cities? Wherever there is trouble, there are always individuals to whom suspicion is attached.
But I would not want to say that the protests and the demonstrations are inspired by foreign foes.
I do say that on occasions where you find this trouble, you also find people who do not approve of our system, and who in some instances contribute to the violence that occurs.
It is the same as it was in my speech.
I spelled it out in somewhat substantial detail in that speech.
I feel that we should do everything we can to increase our exchanges, to understand other people better, to have our scientists and our businessmen, our authors and our newspaper people exchange visits and exchange viewpoints.
I would hope that as a result of tearing down these harriers that some day all people in this world would be willing to be guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, that all peoples would want to cease aggression and would try to live in peace and understanding with their neighbors.
So far as I am concerned, every day I am looking for new ways to understand the viewpoint of others.
And I hope that at a not too distant date mainland China will be willing to open some of the barriers to these exchanges and be willing to perhaps come nearer to abiding by the principles laid down in the United Nations Charter.
I have not examined that statement carefully.
I heard it reported and I read a ticker item on it.
I look with favor upon the general suggestion made.
There is nothing that we would welcome more than for Hanoi to be willing to stop its infiltration and stop trying to gobble up its neighbor; to permit those people to engage in self-determination and select their own government.
We generally approve of the sentiment expressed in the Saigon statement as I interpreted it.
I do not attach any particular significance to the defeat of a Member of the House or the Senate.
In this instance, I think it is a question of the people of the State being rather evenly divided in connection with the Senate race, and that frequently happens under our democratic system.
I know of no unusual significance that I would attach to it.
I think each year you will see some of the candidates win and some lose.
I think until we can have more understanding of what China's plans are and China's hopes are, and what China expects to do in her own way in the future, we would not want to determine our complete course of conduct.
I think we have tried to lead the way by asking them to accept as visitors some of our people, some of our businessmen, and to discuss these problems with them.
We fervently hope, as I have said again and again and again, that all nations in the world will give up their thoughts of aggression and force, and will be willing to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter.
Now until we see some evidence of the willingness of the various countries that may be involved to do that, I would not want to pass judgment on what our action might be.
We are hoping, we are working to the end that all nations embrace those principles.
We have had administration people working on possible proposals to submit to the Congress that could be used in cases of emergencies that vitally affect the public interest.
I must frankly say to you that up to this point we have been unsuccessful in getting legislation that the Secretary of Labor and the other members of my Cabinet felt acceptable, and that we felt would have any chance of passage in the Congress.
We are still searching for an answer.
And we would like to find a solution that could be embraced by the administration, management, labor, and the Congress.
But up to this point we have been quite unsuccess.
No, we have made suggestions to the Congress before they recessed.
The Secretary of the Treasury met with the appropriate committees and recommended that they take certain action in connection with deposits of $10,000 or under, or $100,000 or under, by placing a maximum ceiling rate on the interest paid on those deposits.
The administration thought that would be helpful.
The Congress did not desire to act at that time.
They passed a resolution calling upon the Federal Reserve Board to take action in the matter.
The Secretary of the Treasury went back to a committee of the Congress, and is working with them now.
I discussed that subject last night.
He hopes that we can obtain action through the Banking and Currency Committee of the House on legislation that will be helpful.
We are seriously concerned with the plight of the homebuilder.
We are distressed at the increased costs that are involved in the high interest rates.
We had deep concerns last December when the increase was made by the Federal Reserve before the budget was submitted and without coordinating with the other fiscal agencies of the Government.
But in the light of the situation as we see it now, the best thing that can be done is for Congress to act upon the legislation we have recommended-We expect them to do that.
And we will do everything we can to expedite it.
Well, Bob, I am inclined to agree with some of those people who think that I am not a very good politician some of the time.
I am going to try to do my job as best I can.
I do recognize this is election year.
I will be called upon to visit various parts of the country.
I expect to do so.
I do not think that the people of California need any advice from me to know that Governor Brown has been a great Governor.
I expect to repeat that statement if given the opportunity between now and November, not only in California, but other places.
I think a part of the President's job is to go out into the country, to meet the people, to talk to them, to exchange viewpoints with them.
I plan to take Saturday off this weekend and to go into Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, and Indiana, and I will spend the weekend visiting with the people of those States.
I do not expect to do that every week, but as my duties here in the White House permit, I will take advantage of every opportunity to go out into the country and discuss our program, our convictions; tell them what we stand for, and ask for their support.
We do not have a date or a place.
The leaders of the countries in the hemisphere are now very carefully considering the subjects for that conference.
The staff work is being done on the subjects and the problems that the conference would deal with.
I am unable to, and I think the leaders of the hemisphere at this time are unable, to designate a time or place.
I discussed with the President-elect of Bolivia today this conference, and we look forward with a great deal of interest, other countries being willing, to carrying out the suggestions originally made by a Latin American leader.
But the time has not been set.
We think it would be very fruitful and we would be glad to attend it, and we will, assuming time is given for proper preparation by the staff people.
John, I have tried to give my viewpoint and the viewpoint of this Government on the men who have been captured.
I would hope that they would receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1949.
I believe that any other treatment accorded them would not be accepted by the civilized world.
And I do not want to make any predictions or speculations about what will happen.
I have expressed my viewpoint on what should happen.
I guess I would need a little more information before I got into a complete answer to your question.
The information I have indicated that in order to serve all the press, certain rules were laid down, and that the press, for their convenience, was asked to follow those rules so no one would have an advantage.
Because either some did not accept the rules or some did not follow them, some differences emerged.
But if I could have your permission to just step aside on any of the detailed wedding arrangements, I would like very much to do so.
Yes, more manpower will be required.
We are working day and night on all four fronts.
The economic frontand the report this evening from Ambassador Lodgeindicates that there has been some improvement in prices and the economic situation there.
The diplomatic frontour representatives and the representatives of other nations are now exploring in other capitals, in many other places, the possibilities of trying to find a way to get to the peace table.
On the political front, plans are going forward for the election of the Constituent Assembly early in September, and numbers and numbers of candidates are filing for the places.
We are supplying such advice and counsel as we can in the hope that this will be an orderly democratic election where the majority of the people can freely express themselves, and select the leaders of their choice.
On the military front, our troops under General Westmoreland 14 are giving an excellent account of themselves.
They are attempting to anticipate the enemy and doing everything they can to deter him from further aggression, from additional infiltration, and from the terror that he practices.
The results have been that the enemy has lost about 10 men for every loss the Americans have suffered.
I believe the record for the last 10 weeks shows that the enemy has lost in excess of 1,000 men each week.
Our average has been something like 100.
This week I believe it is less than 100, and I believe theirs is more than 1,200.
The mail that I get, some 50 or 60 letters from the battlefront each week, shows the morale is high, that the men are well trained, that they are well and adequately supplied, and properly led.
We ceased speculating a long time ago on how long this situation would endure.
But I have said to you and to the American people time and again, and I repeat it today, that we shall persist.
We shall send General Westmoreland such men as he may require and request, and they will be amply supplied.
I have no doubt but what they will give a good account of themselves.
Overall, I would say that the reports from the captured prisonersand there have been about twice as many defectors so far this year as there were the same period last year, some 10,000 compared to 4,000but the interviews from a sample of 150 this week indicate that about 15 to 20 percent of the men that have been captured show that they are boys from 12 to 16 years of age.
They show that a good many of their people take 3 months in the infiltration, walking down from North Vietnam, that a good many of them are suffering from malaria, and beriberi, and other diseases.
The men who conducted the bombings on the military targets, the oil supplies of Hanoi and Haiphong, did a very careful but very perfect job.
They hit about 90 percent of the total capacity of that storage, and almost 70 percent of it was destroyed.
Our reports indicate that there were few civilian lives lost, if any.
One estimate was that one civilian was killed, and he was the one that was at the alarm center.
We were very careful not to get out of the target area, in order not to affect civilian populations.
But we are going, with our allies, to continue to do everything that we can to deter the aggressor and to go to the peace table at the earliest possible date.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I intend to nominate  Llewellyn Thompson to be the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
Because of the importance of our relations with the Soviet Union at this time, I am asking  Thompson to return to a post that he has held already, and that he served for a longer period of time than any American Ambassador in this Nation's history.
To succeed him as Ambassador at Large, I will appoint one of our most distinguished and experienced diplomats,  Ellsworth Bunker, who served us with such great distinction in the Dominican Republic and who is presently Ambassador to the Organization of American States.
To serve as my representative to the Organization of American States with the rank of Ambassador, I intend to nominate  Sol M.
Linowitz, the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer of Xerox International, Inc.
Linowitz is a noted American with a long interest in foreign policy.
He will also serve as United States Representative on the Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress, replacing  Rostow.
He will work closely with Secretary Rusk and Secretary Gordon, and with me in the formulation of our Latin American policies.
I have accepted today with great regret the resignation of Eugene P.
Foley as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development.
Foley is returning to private life and will be succeeded by  Ross D.
Davis.
Davis is presently the Administrator of the Economic Development Administration.
As you know, the United States has agreed to attend the conference in Manila on October 24th and 25th.
This will bring together the countries that are most directly helping the South Vietnamese to resist aggression and to build a free nation.
The Philippines, Korea, and Thailand extended the invitation which has been accepted now by South Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
The details of the meetingincluding the agendaare now being worked out in consultation among all the participants.
President Marcos of the Philippines has already indicated the scope of the conference, and we expect:to review the military progress being made in the field;to hear the South Vietnamese plans for further evolution toward representative government, accelerated security of the countryside, and a strengthened economy while curbing inflation;to examine how the other nations present can best support all these efforts; andto explore the prospects for peaceful settlement of the Vietnamese conflict, in the light of all the proposals.
Much of this effort is consistent with the work at Honolulu in February which I considered highly successful.
At that meeting the Government of South Vietnam reinforced its determination:to move toward a democratic constitution and an elected government;to take concrete steps to combat inflation;to invite Vietcong to join them through the Open Arms program; andto multiply efforts in health, education, and agriculture, especially in the countryside.
Each of these steps, as you know.
, has produced results since our meeting in Honolulu in February.
And we are very hopeful that they will receive increased support in our discussions in Manila.
Once aggression has been defeated, a common dedication will also be necessary for the rehabilitation and the development of Vietnam.
Finally, I have agreed to speak to the National Conference of Editorial Writers in New York City tomorrow on our European policy.
Now I will be glad to take any questions that you may have to ask.
I think it is very evident that some of these candidates to whom you refer differ with certain of my policies that deal with equal rights and equal treatment for all of our citizens.
These gubernatorial candidates that you refer to have not asked me to support them and I have no plans to do so.
I doubt that the President should get into every race in every State.
No consideration has been given at this time to any such program or any such visit.
No, I think  Moyers covered that in his press conference yesterday.
We are, of course, hopeful that any action we could take would be reciprocated and would lead in that direction.
But there is nothing that I could say that would be encouraging to you along that line as a result of that action.
I think that every person will draw his own conclusions about the section of the country he is in and the local issues that may exist.
I have no doubt but what our full employment program, our Vietnam engagement, our domestic problemsincluding our civil rights problems-will all play a part in some of the campaigns.
I think it will differ from place to place and candidate to candidate.
I think the 89th Congress, which is made up of both Democrats and Republicans, but predominantly Democrats, has been a very effective and productive Congress in the field of education.
It has passed 18 far-reaching educational measures, 24 health measures.
It has passed more educational measures-this Congressthan all the other 88 Congresses combined.
I believe that most of the Members of that Congress will return home with a very fine record to support them.
And I think that most of them will be reelected.
I think a good many things have a bearing on market fluctuations.
I think the high interest rates, I think the attractiveness of other securities, I think some of the uncertainties that exist concerning how much money the Government itself will be spending next year, I think the questions of doubt about our tax policyall of those are given weight, too.
But I think most of the people in this country feel like 1966 has been a very good year.
There has never been a better one.
And I believe that 1967 will be equally as good.
Yes.
We think the leaders of that country are doing their best to build a stable government.
We think that is very important to the people of this world.
We felt ourselves in a position to be helpful.
The need was great.
We carefully evaluated the requests and decided it would be in the best interests of our own people, as well as the people of Indonesia, to extend the assistance we did.
I am glad that we have taken that action.
First, I would not concur with your legal analysis of the bill.
Second, I am glad of the opportunity that you have given me to state that I believe there is no domestic problem that is more critical than the problem of rebuilding our cities and giving our people who live in the cities opportunities to develop as healthy, educated, productive citizens of our society-citizens who have the ability to get and to hold jobs, and to take pride in the place in which they live.
In order to try to get at the root cause of the problems of the cities, I asked a task force of bipartisan leaders of this Nation to make a careful study of this measure.
Their recommendations are contained in the demonstration cities bill.
Hearings have already been held.
The Senate carefully and thoroughly debated the measure and passed it by an overwhelming majority.
I do not think they gave to it either the interpretation that you place upon it or the fears that you express.
I do hope that the House will take prompt and favorable action early next week.
As I said in the beginning, and as I would repeat again, I think it is one of the most important pieces of legislation for the good of all American mankind that we can act upon this session.
Well, I think the record speaks for itself.
We have recommended approximately 90 bills to this session of Congress, after having the most productive session, the last session, in our history.
We have passed through both Houses about 75 of those 90 bills.
I would suspect in the next 10 days we can pass another 10.
When you pass 85 bills out of 90 recommended, I think that is a pretty good box score.
We passed two measures through the House that had a majority for them in the Senate, but we could not get them voted on-14(b) and the civil rights bill.
We regret that, but there will be other days, and I am sure that in due time a majority will prevail.
I think all in all we have a very outstanding record this year.
I am very proud of it.
I think every Member of Congress of both parties can take pride in it.
No, I do not think so.
I just think you had have to evaluate the critics and judge the circumstances and draw your own conclusions.
And I would not want anyway to spend all afternoon talking about my critics.
As I have said in Rhode Island, Indianapolis, and before the Methodist bishops in the White House last week, every citizen in this land must be concerned with law and order.
The voice of reason must drown out the voice of violence.
We have had very serious problems because of the conditions in our cities, the problems that exist there, and the protests made by our citizens.
I hope that we can keep violence out of the picture.
I have done everything that I know how, in cooperation with the mayors, the chief executives of the cities, and the chief executives of the States concerned.
We are very conscious of the problem.
We are very concerned about it.
We are very determined to do everything within our prerogatives to see that reason prevails over violence, and that law and order always prevails.
We think that the protesters themselves have the most to lose by disapproval of some of the actions that have taken place.
And while we are not oblivious to the problems that bring forth the protests, we are concerned that they be protests without violence and within law and within order.
Yes, I think the Federal Government must be a leader in this field and I havethe 3 years I have been President-tried, by word and action, to do everything I could to bring about equality among the races in this country and to see that the Brown decision affecting the integration of our schools was carried forward expeditiously and in accordance with the lawto see that the civil rights acts passed in the late fifties and sixties and more recently in my administration were carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress; that the law was fully adhered to and fully enforced at all times.
I realize that in some instances there has been some harassment, some mistakes perhaps have been made, some people have been enthusiastic, and differences have developed.
But where those mistakes have been made, I think  Gardner and the Commissioner of Education have been willing to always listen to any protests that might come, and to carry out the law as Congress intended it should be.
That will be the policy of our administration: to continue to promote and to expedite the observance of the law of the land, and to see that all citizens of this country are treated equally without discrimination.
Without passing on the accuracy of your quotation of President Eisenhower, I would say it is the policy of this Government to exercise the best judgment of which we are capable in an attempt to provide the maximum deterrence with a minimum involvement.
The easiest thing we could do is get in a larger war with other nations.
We are constantly concerned with the dangers of that.
At the same time, we have no desire to capitulate or to retreat.
So it has been the policy of your present administration to provide the strength that General Westmoreland felt was necessary: to prevent the aggressor from succeeding without attempting to either conquer or to invade or to destroy North Vietnam.
Our purpose is a limited one and that is to permit self-determination for the people of South Vietnam.
We are going to be concerned with any effort that might take on more far-reaching objectives or implications.
We have not gone into that in any detail at this time.
If any plans develop along that line I will announce them and give you information on them.
I have nothing on it now.
No.
I have not seen any developments in the recent weeks that would cause me to hold out hope or to give you any real justification for encouragement.
We pursue every indication that we have that might offer any possibilities.
We always have an open mind.
And we are very anxious to find any basis for negotiation that would lead to an honorable peace.
But I cannot in frankness be encouraging to you as a result of any specific action of recent weeks.
I would not want to get your hopes up and have you disappointed because we did not achieve everything that I would like to see achieved.
I have a great many objectives and hopes for the people of that area of the world.
Two-thirds of humankind lives in Asia.
And we all know, I think, that their problems are very serious.
Their life expectancy is very short, comparatively speaking.
Their per capita income is very low.
In Vietnam now we have the march of the aggressor's heel stomping on the boundaries of freedom-loving people.
We have the problems of men being killed there every day in an attempt to establish their right to self-determination.
So I would hope that those nations who are committed against aggression in South Vietnam could have a complete review of the military effort being made, and the results of that effort, together with any analysis that our leaders might care to make.
I would think the political and the economic problems of that area of the world would also be a very important subject for discussion.
I think that we should thoroughly explore each leader's ideas about how an honorable peace can be reached, and what course reconstruction efforts following the peace could very properly take, and how we could participate in those efforts.
I would expect, if afforded the opportunity, to be called upon to review some of our thoughts about reconstruction; about the developments resulting from the elections in South Vietnam, and the political developments to be expected there.
I think generally speaking it will give an opportunity for the leaders of the men who are committed to battle in Vietnam to meet and explore ways of finding peace; for bringing an end to the conflict; for making that area of the world prosperous and peaceful in the years to come.
The invitation, as you know, was extended by other countries.
I am sure that they will have some specific plans to suggest.
I want to be a good listener as well as an active participant.
I neglected to mention that  Johnson will accompany me on my trip.
She will join me in most of my official schedule.
During the conferences, as time permits, she will visit various projects and historic sites to gather ideas for use by her National Committee for a More Beautiful Capital and similar civic groups throughout the country.
I think that will be available for you at the door.
We will leave Washington October 17th.
We will return via Alaska, arriving here sometime in the early part of November, November 2nd or 3rd.
Our first stop will be Honolulu.
We will go nonstop from Washington to Honolulu.
We will have some refueling stops en route, but our next stop will be New Zealand.
As you knowand this has been announced several times since I became PresidentI have wanted very much to return to the scenes of my young-man days and go back to New Zealand and Australia where I spent some time in the early forties.
So I will be visiting New Zealand on October 19th for 2 days; Australia, October 21st and 22d; Manila for the conference the 23d through the 27th; Thailand from October 27th through the 30th; Malaysia, October 30th and 31st; Korea, October 31st through November 2d, and then we will return to the United States.
I cannot add anything to the statements that I made in my message to Congress.
I have succinctly summarized it.
The situation today is the same as then.
We are waiting to know how much the Congress will let us spend this coming fiscal year.
There are 8 of the 15 appropriation bills that have not yet passed.
Until they pass, we do not know what the bill will be.
You cannot reduce a bill that you have not received.
As soon as they are passed, we will immediately review those bills, determine how much they can be reduced, and then make a calculation of our revenue.
In the meantime, I am asking Secretary McNamara to make a careful review of our proposed expendituresfirst, the expenditures that have already taken place for the first quarter from June through September.
He will be visiting with Admiral Sharp in Honolulu.
He will leave Saturday night for a visit with General Westmoreland.
I hope by the time that he gets back the Congress will have sent me some of these measures so we can determine how much we can spend, what our revenues will be, what the Vietnam supplemental will be.
Then we will try to make recommendations that will see that our provision is made for revenue to meet whatever deficits we have, if that is possible.
I think that we cannot do this until we receive these bills and these estimates.
We all should bear in mind, however, when the Congress votes add-ons to the remaining eight bills, it must be borne in mind that each vote to increase is likely to be a vote to increase the revenue later.
I will be specific with you just as soon as those bills get here and we analyze them.
We hope we would be able to analyze them so that by the time I would have to act on them I could get some rough estimates.
I am going to take whatever action is necessary to see that we have a sound fiscal policy.
But I cannot take that action until the appropriation bills are voted upon and it is determined.
For instance, yesterday in the Senate the committee reported a bill that provided three-fourths of a billion dollars more than the Senate ultimately voted.
So if we had calculated before the vote was taken, we would have been $750 million off.
We will take prompt action as soon as the Congress makes its recommendations and as soon as I can ascertain from the military what their best guess is as to the expenditures for the immediate future.
Thank you,  President.
Secretary Connor, Secretary Fowler, Senator Mansfield, Senator McClellan, Senator Jackson, distinguished Speaker McCormack, Chairman Dawson, Congressman Holifield,  Congresswoman Dwyer, other Members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished Mayors: We are deeply grateful for your presence in the East Room of the White House today.
In a large measure, America's history is a history of her transportation.
Our early cities were located by deep water harbors and inland waterways; they were nurtured by ocean vessels and by flatboats.
The railroad allowed us to move east and west.
A thousand towns and more grew up along the railroad's gleaming rails.
The automobile stretched out over cities and created suburbia in America.
Trucks and modern highways brought bounty to remote regions.
Airplanes helped knit our Nation together, and knitted it together with other nations throughout the world.
And today, all Americans are really neighbors.
Transportation is the biggest industry we have in this country.
It involves one out of every five dollars in our economy.
Our system of transportation is the greatest of any country in the world.
But we must face facts.
We must be realistic.
We must knowand we must have the courage to let our people know-that our system is no longer adequate.
During the next two decades, the demand for transportation in this country is going to more than double.
But we are already falling far behind with the demand as it is.
Our lifeline is tangled.
Today we are confronted by traffic jams.
Today we are confronted by commuter crises, by crowded airports, by crowded air lanes, by screeching airplanes, by archaic equipment, by safety abuses, and roads that scar our Nation's beauty.
We have come to this historic East Room of the White House today to establish and to bring into being a Department of Transportation, the second Cabinet office to be added to the President's Cabinet in recent months.
This Department of Transportation that we are establishing will have a mammoth taskto untangle, to coordinate, and to build the national transportation system for America that America is deserving of.
And because the job is great, I intend to appoint a strong man to fill it.
The new Secretary will be my principal adviser and my strong right arm on all transportation matters.
I hope he will be the best equipped man in this country to give leadership to the country, to the President, to the Cabinet, to the Congress.
Among the many duties the new department will have, several deserve very special notice.
To improve the safety in every means of transportation, safety of our automobiles, our trains, our planes, and our ships.
To bring new technology to every mode of transportation by supporting and promoting research and development.
To solve our most pressing transportation problems.
A day will come in America when people and freight will move through this land of ours speedily, efficiently, safely, dependably, and cheaply.
That will be a good day and a great day in America.
Our transportation system was built by the genius of free enterprise.
And as long as I am President, it will be sustained by free enterprise.
In a few respects, this bill falls short of our original hopes.
It does not include the Maritime Administration.
As experience is gained in the department, I would hope that the Congress could reexamine its decision to leave this key transportation activity alone, outside its jurisdiction.
But what is most important, I think, is that you, for the first time in modern history, have created and have brought for me to sign, a measure giving us a new Cabinet department.
It was proposed, it will be established, and it will be in operation in the same year.
All of these things took place in the same year.
It is the second major step in bringing our Government up to date with the times.
Last year this Congress established the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs.
Today you bring 31 agencies and their bureaus, going in all directions, into a single Department of Transportation under the guidance and leadership of a Secretary of Transportation.
I think in fairness, candor requires me to review that this recommendation was made many years ago by the Hoover Commission, headed by the distinguished former President.
This recommendation was urged upon the Congress and the people, and recommended many years ago by a most distinguished and popular President, President Dwight David Eisenhower.
This recommendation was made and urged upon the President and the Congress many years ago by the Senate Commerce Committee, and by dozens and dozens of enlightened, intelligent Members of both Houses of both parties.
What we are here today to do is to salute the members of both parties, the leadership of both parties, and everyone who contributed to finally bringing our performance in line with our promise.
And I do not guess it would be good to say this, and I may even be criticized for saying it, but this, in effect, is another coonskin on the wall.
Secretary Rusk, and members of the Cabinet,  Speaker McCormack, Leaders Mansfield and Dirksen, ladies and gentlemen: I leave you this morning to undertake a hopeful mission.
I go to visit six nations which, working with others, are beginning to shape a new regional life in Asia and the Pacific.
I have followed with admiration the energetic progress made in Asia by Asians.
I have been happy to receive at the White House recently the leaders of those countries.
Now I am availing myself of this opportunity to repay their visits and to see their people, and to visit in their great countries.
I go to learn of their progress and problems, their hopes and their concerns for their children and for their future.
At Manila we shall consider the problem of Vietnam.
A small Asian nation is under attack, defending itself with extraordinary courage and endurance.
I go to confer with its leaders and with the leaders of those other nations that have committed their young men to defeat aggression and to help those 15 million people shape their own destiny.
We shall review the state of military operations; but we shall mainly devote our attention to the civil, constructive side of the problem of Vietnam.
We shall together seek ways of bringing about an honorable peace at the earliest possible moment.
I know that I can wave no wand.
I do not expect anything magical to happen or any miracles to develop.
But as I undertake this mission on behalf of our entire Nation at a most critical time in our history, I am inspired and strengthened by the presence of the leaders of the Congress here this morning, the members of the Cabinet, and by the unity of the American people.
I ask for your prayers.
I shall do my best to advance the cause of peace and of human progress.
Thank all of you very much.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We have heard from the British.
We are delighted to have their views and their suggestions.
We are very agreeable and rather anxious to meet, as I have said over the past months, anywhere, any time that Hanoi is willing to come to a conference table.
We appreciate the interest of all peace-loving nations in arranging a cease-fire, in attempting to bring the disputing parties together, and in an effort to work out a conference where various views can be exchanged.
America is ready to designate her representative today, and will be glad to do so if the other parties do likewise.
On the Secretary General, we have encouraged him in every way we can to take leadership and initiative, and use the full influence and resources of the United Nations to bring about a stop of the violence on both sides, to bring an end to the total war by both sides.
And any recommendations he makes, any suggestions he presents, will be very carefully considered and evaluated insofar as the United States is concerned.
We will be glad to meet anyone more than halfway, insofar as talking instead of fighting is concerned.
Well, I have followed our activity in Vietnam very closely.
I think the country knowsand I would like to repeat againthat it is the policy of this Government to bomb only military targets.
We realize that when you do that, inevitably and almost invariably there are casualties, there are losses of lives.
We regret to see those losses.
We do everything we can to minimize them.
But they do occur in North Vietnam as they do in South Vietnam.
There are thousands of civilians who have died this year in South Vietnam as a result of detonation of grenades and bombs.
And every casualty is to be regretted.
But only military targets have been authorized.
And I am informed that our men who are responsible for carrying out our orders have done their very best to execute those orders as given.
I believe that we will have a good year.
This year has brought us great satisfaction in many fields, and some disappointments in others.
But on the whole I believe that generally there are more people working today than have ever worked before.
They are making better wages than they have ever made before.
The farmer's income is almost at an all-time high, almost a net income of $5,000 per year.
On the domestic front we have made great advances in educating more children, in providing better schools, in improving their health, in making deep dents in reducing poverty.
In our foreign affairs, we have had some disappointments.
We deeply regret that we had to send substantial forces to Vietnam in July of 1965.
In the 18 months they have been there, although we think there has been a decided turn in the military situation, we have not been able to arrange a cease-fire or to bring the other side to the conference table, or to bring peace to the world.
We have diligently worked for 18 months in every way we know how, but we have not succeeded.
That is one of our major regrets.
We have done our best to hold NATO together, and we think we have had some success in that direction.
We think in Latin America things are on the upgrade.
We think in Asia, as a result of our Manila Conference and our other efforts in that direction, things are going as good as we expected.
We can point in Africa to the African Development Bank.
And while there are mixed situations in both Africa and the Middle East, we have done our best to live up to our responsibilities.
And we think generally speaking the American people have much to be thankful for.
There are many challenges ahead.
There are many problems yet unsolved.
But in unity there is strength.
I believe that the new Congress and this administration will put the interest of the Nation first and do what we can to solve the problems that remain unsolved.
In short, I think we have had a generally good year.
I think most Americans believe that they have done reasonably well this year.
We all deeply regret that in 18 months we have not been able to bring peace to the world.
It is our hope that all the nations of the world could reach some agreement in the field of nonproliferation.
In recent weeks I have felt encouraged about the discussions that have taken place.
I wish that it were possible to say to the American people and to the world that all the nations of the world could reach agreement in this field.
As yet we have not been able to bring that about.
And even when we bring it about, we do not know that all nations will agree.
We are working to that end.
We think it is a desirable objective.
We will hope for the best.
I think it is very difficult to see economic indicators 12 months in advance and conclude just what will happen.
But I believe we will have a good year in 1967.
I believe we will have good employment, good wages, good profits.
And I do not see anything that would make me believe at this stage that we are going to be disappointed in those predictions.
No.
The answer is no to both questions.
I presume you know we got two increases this year in taxes.
We took from the economy through administrative and legislative action several billions of dollars.
We think we took an adequate amount from the economy.
We estimated our deficit for this year at $6 billion 4 million at the beginning of the year, and it turned out to be $2 billion 3 million.
We passed, and I signed on March 15, the first tax measure which reinstituted some excise taxes, accelerated the payment of others, increased the withholdings, both by administrative and legislative action.
In September we submitted another program that involved the investment credit provision, and, by suspending that, increasing our tax revenues a very minimal amount.
Primarily that measure was passed in order to cool the economy.
Most of the economists felt that was desirable and the Congress agreed.
I do not believe that we could have passed any more tax measures than we passed.
I think on the two tax measures passed it was desirable that we did so.
In March I met with leaders of business in the country, dozens of them.
I consulted with leading economists.
I asked them at the White House in March how many of them favored a tax increase and there was not a single hand that went up.
I read in the papers in retrospect some people feel very strongly there should have been another tax increase.
But in the light of the developments of the economy at this moment, I do not think so.
None whatever.
There has been no change.
So far as the evidence that we have at this time there has been no mistake.
I can only repeat to you what I have said before, and what has been said by other departments of the Government.
Our orders are to bomb only military targets.
Those are the only orders we have issued.
We believe that our men have carried out those orders to the very best of their ability.
There will be civilian casualties in connection with the bombing of military targets.
There are civilian casualties taking place every daysome this morningin South Vietnam.
I am concerned with casualties in both South Vietnam and North Vietnam.
And I wish that all of our people would be equally as concerned.
I think that the quicker we can have a peace conference, the quicker we can arrange a true cease-fire, the quicker we can stop this total war on both sides, the better off all of our people will be.
But as long as it goes on, civilians are going to be killed, casualties will occur.
And I regret every single casualty in both areas.
I think that we are making the plans that we believe are in the best interest of this country.
I do not think anyone can say with any precision when the peace conference will come, when a truce can be arranged, when a cease-fire can be agreed upon, when agreement can be reached between nations.
We are preparing our people to protect our national interest and our agreements and our commitments.
lust how long they will be required to do so, I am not able to predict.
If I did predict, I would have no doubt but what I would live to regret it.
Yes, I think the Nation can afford to continue as we have to fight wars on both fronts.
I do not think there is anyone who feels that we should not supply our men with what they need.
I would differ with you in that respect.
Second, I think there are those who feel that as long as we are in Vietnam, that we should reduce our expenditures every possible way here at home.
I feel that we ought to take all the water that we can out of the budget.
And I have spent several weeks trying to do that.
But I am not one who feels, as I said last January and as I will say again next January, that we must neglect the health and the education of our children; that we can overlook the needs of our cities; that we must bring progress to a stop.
I think that we must strengthen our people.
We must continue our efforts to reduce poverty.
We must continue the war against our ancient enemies just as we are continuing it in South Vietnamuntil aggression ceases; and until we can provide each child with all the education that he can take; until we can see that our families have a decent income; until we can secure the measures that are necessary to improve our cities, to curb pollution, to reduce poverty.
I think this Nation with a gross national product of some $700 to $800 billion can afford what it needs to spend.
And I shall so recommend.
The exact amounts I do not know.
This year's budget was increased some because of increased needs in Vietnam.
In 18 months we have sent several hundred thousand men there.
Our budget this year will be somewhere between $125 and $130 billion.
We cannot predict what our budget will be next year.
But as has been stated by reliable authorities, and as has been written on good authority, the general figure has been between $135 and $140 billion.
Some said between $137 and $140 billionit is highly speculative, allowing some $2 or $3 billion one way or the other.
A great many of those decisions have not yet been made.
There are several appeals pending from the military.
There are several important decisions that have not yet been made in the field of health, education, and poverty.
I expect to return to Washington early next week to conclude the meetings in that regard, and to have my recommendations ready for the Congress at as early a date as possible.
In short, I think we can, I think we must, I think we will continue to do what is necessary at home and send our men abroad what they need to do their job.
Well, I would not want to make an indictment or review all of your contributions to this matter, or all the reasons and motivations of the various people who feel that mistakes have been made.
In my own judgment, we have done the best we could.
We have worked at our job.
We have made the decisions that we thought ought to be made.
We realize that we have made some mistakes, although I know of no major decision that I have made that I would strike from the statute books tomorrow or would rewrite.
I think that some of the decisions have not been popular.
I think that there has been criticism of the administration.
And I regret all of that.
I would hope that the Nation would see things pretty much alike in the days to come.
All I can say is I am going to do the best I can to make the proper decisions, those that are in the best interests of the country.
And then I think if you do what is best for the country, the country will do what is best for us.
We are trying to decide how much money we will spend next year in the military and civilian fields.
We are trying to study developments in the economy.
We are trying to determine the extent of our deficit.
We are trying to anticipate, as far ahead as we can, economic indicators.
We will bring all of these people together, the Treasury, the economic advisers, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, the congressional leadership, and then attempt to make the recommendation that we think is justified.
We are working very hard on it but we have not made a decision.
We are not ready to announce one, or make a recommendation today.
We do not have any definite date.
The advisory committee that I have appointed has given great consideration to this.
General McKee will have an announcement in connection with it shortly.
Just when the decision to move ahead will come on the part of the executive, and the legislative, I am unable to predict at this moment.
It is still a matter that is receiving top consideration in the administration.
And of course, after we make our study and our recommendations, I am sure the Congress will give it very prompt consideration and high level consideration.
But until we make ours and they conclude, we will not know definitely what will happen.
We will be very glad to do more than our 'part in meeting Hanoi halfway in any possible cease-fire, or truce, or peace conference negotiations.
I would be very interested in what their response is and what they would be agreeable to before irrevocably committing this country.
If you can look at all the decisions they make and their reactions, I think we would better be able to determine our own.
I have said on a number of occasions that we are ready to talk, any time and anywhere, that the Vietcong will have no difficulty in making their views known to us.
But all the questions turn on when are we willing to do it, and are we willing to do it.
The answer to those questions is a strong yes.
But up to this moment we have heard nothing from the other side.
You just cannot have a one-sided peace conference, or a one-sided cessation of hostilities, or ask our own boys not to defend themselves, or to tie their hands behind them, unless the other side is willing to reciprocate.
Now, I assure you that we are willing to meet them more than halfway, if there is any indication of movement on their part.
No.
Thank you,  President.
Speaker,  Vice President, distinguished Members of the Congress: I share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body, the distinguished Representative from Rhode Island,  Fogarty.
I have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing for our Nation.
At home, the question is whether we will continue working for better opportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living better than any people in history.
Abroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly remote.
So our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the dangers to us are obvious and dose at hand, but, rather, whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distantand some think that it is safe to lay down our burdens.
I have come tonight m ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that issue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad-to continue to build a better Americaand to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.
As President Abraham Lincoln said, We must ask where we are, and whither we are tending.
The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better country.
We have struck down legal barriers to equality.
We have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year alone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.
We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.
Three and one-half million Americans have already received treatment under Medicare since July.
We have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more Americans on the payrolls in the last year alone.
We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum wage.
We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1 million Americans.
We have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in the neighborhoods of the poor.
We have set out to rebuild our cities on a scale that has never been attempted before.
We have begun to rescue our waters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside, our cities and our towns.
We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the Neighborhood Youth Corpsor through Head Start, a chance to learn.
So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people.
And, we have succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few.
Now we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress, or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been-abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.
I believe that our people do not want to quitthough the task is great, the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or months, but of years-and sometimes it may be even decades.
I have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward the progress of these last 3 years.
These five ways concern programs, partnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace.
First, programs.
We must see to it, I think, that these new programs that we have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible way.
Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social progress.
This required trial and errorand it has produced both.
But as we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we are trying to improve our tactics.
In the long run, these startssome rewarding, others inadequate and disappointingare crucial to SUCCESS One example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate among us.
On a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American President, Harry S.
Truman, declare this: The American people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease.
Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few understood what was required and did anything about it.
The executive branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President presented.
And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, It will not be a short or easy struggle-no single weapon.
will sufficebut we shall not rest until that war is won.
And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.
I recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.
I shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the Congressas well as some that we have learned from our own trial and error.
I shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of thousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big cities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young, little children.
The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must command our full determination.
For learning brings skills; and skills bring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, as well as taxes.
This warlike the war in Vietnamis not a simple one.
There is no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart.
The enemy is not easy to perceive, or to isolate, or to destroy.
There are mistakes and there are setbacks.
But we are moving, and our direction is forward.
This is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground.
Some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into them.
Administrative skills and trained manpower are just as vital to their success as dollars.
And I believe those skills will come.
But it will take time and patience and hard work.
Success cannot be forced at a single stroke.
So we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success is to comeas we know it must.
We have done much in the space of two short years, working together.
I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.
I have come tonight to propose that we establish a new departmenta Department of Business and Labor.
By combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and other related agencies, I think we can create a more economical, efficient, and streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation.
This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government.
Every program will be thoroughly evaluated.
Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our Governors.
Where there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them.
Where there has been progress, we will try to build upon it.
Our second objective is partnershipto create an effective partnership at all levels of government.
And I should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.
The 88th and the 89th Congresses passed more social and economic legislation than any two single Congresses in American history.
Most of you who were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those measures.
But your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people.
Federal energy is essential.
But it is not enough.
Only a total working partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed.
The test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization, each private institution, and each responsible citizen.
Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and as I see you are examining yours.
Some will need to reorganize and reshape their methods of administration-as we are doing.
Others will need to revise their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to dateas we are doing.
Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more efficiently.
During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments about $40 billion in grants-in-aid.
This year alone, 70 percent of our Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the State and local governments.
With Federal assistance, State and local governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually.
These enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively.
We intend to work closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.
Our third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that we have established within the resources that are available.
I wish, of course, that we could do all that should be doneand that we could do it now.
But the Nation has many commitments and responsibilities which make heavy demands upon our total resources.
No administration would more eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than the administration that started them.
So let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we haveknowing that it is far, far more than we have ever done before, and far, far less than our problems will ultimately require.
Let us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans who need special help.
We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the early years.
We should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest years, before it is too late to correct.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their Nation's progress.
We should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20 percent.
That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security payments in the first year.
I will recommend that each of the 23 million Americans now receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.
I will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percentfrom $44 to $70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for those with a total of 25 years of coverage.
We must raise the limits that retired workers can earn without losing social security income.
We must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age.
We should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to the forgotten in our midstthe American Indians and the migratory farm workers.
And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
So let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning of justice for all of our fellow Americans.
We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the landmark Model Cities program.
I intend to seek for this effort, this year, the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.
We should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great cities.
We should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at its sources, andbecause air, like water, does not respect manmade boundarieswe should set up regional airsheds throughout this great land.
We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for a beautiful Americato dean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our cities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that come after us to enjoy.
We should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizenbefore a jury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights.
We should find a solution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color, has a decent home of his choice.
We should modernize our Selective Service System.
The National Commission on Selective Service will shortly submit its report.
I will send you new recommendations to meet our military manpower needs.
But let us resolve that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as effective as possible.
We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the right most valued by civilized menthe right to privacy.
We should outlaw all wiretappingpublic and privatewherever and whenever it occurs, except when the security of this Nation itself is at stakeand only then with the strictest governmental safeguards.
And we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic bugging and snooping.
I hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer.
We should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed where average citizens can understand it.
We should immediately take steps to prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against hazardous household products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry natural gas across our Nation.
We should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000 permanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age.
We should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform and financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating lobbying, and by restoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move their residences.
We should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our classrooms.
We should insist that the public interest be fully served through the public's airwaves.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
Now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our mindson yours and mine.
This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.
The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended.
We appointed the National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the best ways to carry that attack forward.
And while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its preliminary recommendations we are ready to move.
This is not a war that Washington alone can win.
The idea of a national police force is repugnant to the American people.
Crime must be rooted out in local communities by local authorities.
Our policemen must be better trained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the local citizens that they try to serve and to protect.
The National Government can and expects to help.
And so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967.
It will enable us to assist those States and cities that try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces better, their corrections systems more effective, and their courts more efficient.
When the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost:90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master plans, to combat crime in their area;60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on crime;50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police academy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best trained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere.
We will also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from becoming adult delinquents.
We will seek new partnerships with States and cities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem.
And we will recommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.
At the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free Americaas Abraham Lincoln once saidmust let reverence for the laws.
become the political religion of the Nation.
Our country's laws must be respected.
Order must be maintained.
And I will supportwith all the constitutional powers the President possessesour Nation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our communities.
Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have already been laid.
Some will necessarily be small at first, but every beginning is a consequence.
If we postpone this urgent work now, it will simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.
Our fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead, moving ahead steadily and safely.
We have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity.
Last year, in 1966:Wages were the highest in history-and the unemployment rate, announced yesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years;Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent;Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;Our gross national product advanced 5.
5 percent, to about $740 billion;Income per farm went up 6 percent.
Now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.
5 percent over the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam.
This was more than we had expectedand the Government tried to do everything that we knew how to do to hold it down.
Yet we were not as successful as we wished to be.
In the 18 months after we entered World War II, prices rose not 4.
5 percent, but 13.
5 percent.
In the first 18 months after Korea, after the conflict broke out there, prices rose not 4.
5 percent, but 11 percent.
During those two periods we had OPA price control that the Congress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.
Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to avoid imposing them.
We believe that we have done better, but we make no pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.
Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit.
They imposed very severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders, and all those associated with the home industry.
Last January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and moderate tax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion.
Legislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the economy.
With these measures, in both instances, the Congress approved most of the recommendations rather promptly.
As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored.
Wholesale prices are lower tonight than they were in August.
So are retail food prices.
Monetary conditions are also easing.
Most interest rates have retreated from their earlier peaks.
More money now seems to be available.
Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly seek, I am confident that this movement can continue.
I pledge the American people that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest rates and to ease money in this country.
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to savings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.
We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals; that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the progress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and toward lower interest rates.
I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxesto last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue.
I will promptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these expenditures permits it.
This surcharge will raise revenues by some $4.
5 billion in the first year.
For example, a person whose tax payment, the tax he owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an extra $60 over the 12-month period, or $5 a month.
The overwhelming majority of Americans who pay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $5 a month.
Married couples with two children, with incomes up to $5,000 per year, will be exempt from this taxas will single people with an income of up to $1,900 a year.
Now if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect when I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual taxes would have been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates.
So this proposal is that while we have this problem and this emergency in Vietnam, while we are trying to meet the needs of our people at home, your Government asks for slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give our country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of trial.
For fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.
7 billion and revenues of $117 billion.
That will leave us a deficit this year of $9.
7 billion.
For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion.
And with the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate revenues will be $126.
9 billion.
The deficit then will be $8.
1 billion.
I will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress.
Yours is the responsibility to discuss and to debate them-to approve or modify or reject them.
I welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a colleague and as Vice President and President.
I should like to say to the Members of the oppositionwhose numbers, if I am not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhatthat the genius of the American political system has always been best expressed through creative debate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives.
Throughout our history, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to understand this.
So let there be light and reason in our relations.
That is the way to a responsible session and a responsive government.
Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the quality of life for every Americannot just the rich, not just the poor, but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.
We all go to schoolto good schools or bad schools.
We all take air into our lungs-clean air or polluted air.
We all drink waterpure water or polluted water.
We all face sickness someday, and some more often than we wish, and old age as well.
We all have a stake in this Great Societyin its economic growth, in reduction of civil strifea great stake in good government.
We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this country in these years.
Our children's children will pay the price if we are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.
Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change.
But abroad, as at home, there is a greater risk in standing still.
No part of our foreign policy is so sacred that it ever remains beyond review.
We shall be flexible where conditions in the world changeand where man's efforts can change them for the better.
We are in the midst of a great transition-a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet.
In Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly to give our hemispheric policies new direction.
We have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American effort in economic and social development was launched by the conference at Bogota in 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower.
The Alliance for Progress moved dramatically forward under President Kennedy.
There is new confidence that the voice of the people is being heard; that the dignity of the individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere, and we are facing up to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together.
In this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happenbecause it has happened.
So together, I think, we must now move to strike down the barriers to full cooperation among the American nations, and to free the energies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our citizens.
Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America.
It has yet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above all, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible.
There, too, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa cooperate on a regional basis.
More and more our programs for Africa are going to be directed toward self-help.
The future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts.
Our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those who are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races, and to help those who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence.
In the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately, has not yet taken hold.
An already tortured peace seems to be constantly threatened.
We shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities of improved relations among the nations of that region.
We are working hard at that task.
In the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the earth's population.
Over the years weand othershave invested very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and Pakistan.
We are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict.
It must strengthen their capacity to help themselves.
It must help these two nationsboth our friendsto overcome poverty, to emerge as self-reliant leaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation.
In Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common defense.
But we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved through measures of arms control and disarmament, and through other forms of practical agreement.
We are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs, in economic and technical cooperation, in trade negotiations, in political consultation, and in working together with the governments and peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve when we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild Europe.
We faced new challenges and opportunities then and thereand we faced also some dangers.
But I believe that the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both sides of this Chamber, wanted to face them together.
Our relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in transition.
We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war.
When we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for that matter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and without venom.
Our objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it.
We have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses of outer space.
We have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.
We have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.
We are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial credits to Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to Romania and Yugoslavia.
We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another 2 years.
We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to embassies.
We have started discussions with international agencies on ways of increasing contacts with Eastern European countries.
This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world that were entered into before I became President.
So tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by approving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile capabilities.
It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile defense.
My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our allies.
I would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and the United States is in our common interest, in arms control and in disarmament.
We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us, if that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons and defenses.
I thought we were making some progress in that direction the first few months I was in office.
I realize that any additional race would impose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an additional waste of resources with no gain in security to either side.
I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the Congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing directly upon this problem.
Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human family is the race between food supply and population increase.
That race tonight is being lost.
The time for rhetoric has clearly passed.
The time for concerted action is here and we must get on with the job.
We believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed: First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food production, including the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise.
Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into voluntary family planning programs.
And third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves.
Every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance.
I come now finally to Southeast Asia-and to Vietnam in particular.
Soon I will submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation.
Tonight I want to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.
We are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies are committed by the SEATO Treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in Southeast Asia.
We are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the United States, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically violated by the Communists.
That violation threatens the independence of all the small nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world.
We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to remain non-Communistif that is what they choose-as North Vietnam has to remain Communist.
We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression.
No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by the great Thomas Jefferson:It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater.
We have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to prevent a larger wara war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the Communists succeed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by aggression and by force.
I believe, and I am supported by some authority, that if they are not checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them later.
That is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that is why it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago.
You will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago.
Is there anyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was not changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggressionthis time it was in Korea.
Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had failed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south.
The Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as we said 16 years ago in Korea: This far and no further.
I think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a stubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to settle political questions.
I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over.
This I cannot do.
We face more cost, more loss, and more agony.
For the end is not yet.
I cannot promise you that it will come this yearor come next year.
Our adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting longer than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to stand up and resist.
Our men in that areathere are nearly 500,000 nowhave borne well the burden and the heat of the day.
Their efforts have deprived the Communist enemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago.
We have steadily frustrated his main forces.
General Westmoreland reports that the enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield.
So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustainedand will be sustained-until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more than he can ever gain.
I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resourceof laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade.
That, and patienceand I mean a great deal of patience.
Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight.
Because they must provide real security to the people living in the countryside.
And this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces.
It means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they can respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in, and that they can have a personal stake in.
We hope that government is now beginning to emerge.
While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the very distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that South Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency.
We can help, but only they can win this part of the war.
Their task is to build and protect a new life in each rural province.
One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.
It is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence is not going to be slammed shut.
They know that it is possible for them to choose their own national destinieswithout coercion.
The 'performance of our men in Vietnam-backed by the American peoplehas created a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of Asia and the Pacific.
I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent in their homes and in their countries.
Fear of external Communist conquest in many Asian nations is already subsidingand with this, the spirit of hope is rising.
For the first time in history, a common outlook and common institutions are already emerging.
This forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of Asian nations themselves.
It was precisely this movement that we hoped to accelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965, and I pledged a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that part of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we were spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production.
Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of the billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the Congress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are already open.
Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new directions.
Their hopes are high.
Their faith is strong.
Their confidence is deep.
And even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying forward this constructive historic development.
As recommended by the Eugene Black mission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a special authorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian regional programs.
We are eager to turn our resources to peace.
Our efforts in behalf of humanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary line.
The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask the Congress for funds to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam-and their deserving neighbors who wish our help.
We shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of Mainland China and the world communityincluding working together in all the tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate of the Chinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends.
We would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her neighbors' rights.
We would be the first to applaud her were she to apply her great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people.
And we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for security and friendly relations with her neighboring countries.
Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that we, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam through to an honorable peace.
We will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and others, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional discussions of peaceanywhere, any time.
And we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.
Until such efforts succeed, or until the infiltration ceases, or until the conflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is that we just must firmly pursue our present course.
We will stand firm in Vietnam.
I think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest burden of all.
With their lives they serve their Nation.
We must give them nothing less than our full supportand we have given them that-nothing less than the determination that Americans have always given their fighting men.
Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is small compared to their own.
How long it will take I cannot prophesy.
I only know that the will of the American people, I think, is tonight being tested.
Whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time, and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to get it over with is inviting but dangerous; whether we can accept the necessity of choosing a great evil in order to ward off a greater; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the passions that are ordinarily loosed in time of waron all these questions so much turns.
The answers will determine not only where we are, but whither we are tending.
A time of testingyes.
And a time of transition.
The transition is sometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and often quite dangerous.
But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come.
We know that man is born unto trouble.
We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many men.
For all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations that concern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve, for all the issues we must face with the agony that attends them, let us remember that those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it.
But let us also count not only our burdens but our blessingsfor they are many.
And let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.
Let us draw encouragement from the signs of hopefor they, too, are many.
Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been found wanting.
So with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your support, we are going to persistand we are going to succeed.
Speaker,  Vice President, distinguished Members of the Congress: I share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body, the distinguished Representative from Rhode Island,  Fogarty.
I have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing for our Nation.
At home, the question is whether we will continue working for better opportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living better than any people in history.
Abroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly remote.
So our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the dangers to us are obvious and dose at hand, but, rather, whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distantand some think that it is safe to lay down our burdens.
I have come tonight m ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that issue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad-to continue to build a better Americaand to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.
As President Abraham Lincoln said, We must ask where we are, and whither we are tending.
The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better country.
We have struck down legal barriers to equality.
We have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year alone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.
We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.
Three and one-half million Americans have already received treatment under Medicare since July.
We have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more Americans on the payrolls in the last year alone.
We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum wage.
We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1 million Americans.
We have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in the neighborhoods of the poor.
We have set out to rebuild our cities on a scale that has never been attempted before.
We have begun to rescue our waters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside, our cities and our towns.
We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the Neighborhood Youth Corpsor through Head Start, a chance to learn.
So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people.
And, we have succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few.
Now we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress, or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been-abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.
I believe that our people do not want to quitthough the task is great, the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or months, but of years-and sometimes it may be even decades.
I have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward the progress of these last 3 years.
These five ways concern programs, partnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace.
First, programs.
We must see to it, I think, that these new programs that we have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible way.
Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social progress.
This required trial and errorand it has produced both.
But as we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we are trying to improve our tactics.
In the long run, these startssome rewarding, others inadequate and disappointingare crucial to SUCCESS One example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate among us.
On a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American President, Harry S.
Truman, declare this: The American people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease.
Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few understood what was required and did anything about it.
The executive branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President presented.
And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, It will not be a short or easy struggle-no single weapon.
will sufficebut we shall not rest until that war is won.
And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.
I recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.
I shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the Congressas well as some that we have learned from our own trial and error.
I shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of thousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big cities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young, little children.
The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must command our full determination.
For learning brings skills; and skills bring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, as well as taxes.
This warlike the war in Vietnamis not a simple one.
There is no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart.
The enemy is not easy to perceive, or to isolate, or to destroy.
There are mistakes and there are setbacks.
But we are moving, and our direction is forward.
This is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground.
Some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into them.
Administrative skills and trained manpower are just as vital to their success as dollars.
And I believe those skills will come.
But it will take time and patience and hard work.
Success cannot be forced at a single stroke.
So we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success is to comeas we know it must.
We have done much in the space of two short years, working together.
I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.
I have come tonight to propose that we establish a new departmenta Department of Business and Labor.
By combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and other related agencies, I think we can create a more economical, efficient, and streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation.
This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government.
Every program will be thoroughly evaluated.
Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our Governors.
Where there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them.
Where there has been progress, we will try to build upon it.
Our second objective is partnershipto create an effective partnership at all levels of government.
And I should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.
The 88th and the 89th Congresses passed more social and economic legislation than any two single Congresses in American history.
Most of you who were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those measures.
But your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people.
Federal energy is essential.
But it is not enough.
Only a total working partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed.
The test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization, each private institution, and each responsible citizen.
Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and as I see you are examining yours.
Some will need to reorganize and reshape their methods of administration-as we are doing.
Others will need to revise their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to dateas we are doing.
Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more efficiently.
During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments about $40 billion in grants-in-aid.
This year alone, 70 percent of our Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the State and local governments.
With Federal assistance, State and local governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually.
These enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively.
We intend to work closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.
Our third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that we have established within the resources that are available.
I wish, of course, that we could do all that should be doneand that we could do it now.
But the Nation has many commitments and responsibilities which make heavy demands upon our total resources.
No administration would more eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than the administration that started them.
So let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we haveknowing that it is far, far more than we have ever done before, and far, far less than our problems will ultimately require.
Let us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans who need special help.
We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the early years.
We should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest years, before it is too late to correct.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their Nation's progress.
We should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20 percent.
That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security payments in the first year.
I will recommend that each of the 23 million Americans now receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.
I will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percentfrom $44 to $70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for those with a total of 25 years of coverage.
We must raise the limits that retired workers can earn without losing social security income.
We must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age.
We should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to the forgotten in our midstthe American Indians and the migratory farm workers.
And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
So let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning of justice for all of our fellow Americans.
We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the landmark Model Cities program.
I intend to seek for this effort, this year, the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.
We should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great cities.
We should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at its sources, andbecause air, like water, does not respect manmade boundarieswe should set up regional airsheds throughout this great land.
We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for a beautiful Americato dean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our cities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that come after us to enjoy.
We should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizenbefore a jury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights.
We should find a solution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color, has a decent home of his choice.
We should modernize our Selective Service System.
The National Commission on Selective Service will shortly submit its report.
I will send you new recommendations to meet our military manpower needs.
But let us resolve that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as effective as possible.
We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the right most valued by civilized menthe right to privacy.
We should outlaw all wiretappingpublic and privatewherever and whenever it occurs, except when the security of this Nation itself is at stakeand only then with the strictest governmental safeguards.
And we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic bugging and snooping.
I hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer.
We should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed where average citizens can understand it.
We should immediately take steps to prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against hazardous household products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry natural gas across our Nation.
We should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000 permanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age.
We should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform and financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating lobbying, and by restoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move their residences.
We should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our classrooms.
We should insist that the public interest be fully served through the public's airwaves.
And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
Now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our mindson yours and mine.
This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.
The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended.
We appointed the National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the best ways to carry that attack forward.
And while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its preliminary recommendations we are ready to move.
This is not a war that Washington alone can win.
The idea of a national police force is repugnant to the American people.
Crime must be rooted out in local communities by local authorities.
Our policemen must be better trained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the local citizens that they try to serve and to protect.
The National Government can and expects to help.
And so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967.
It will enable us to assist those States and cities that try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces better, their corrections systems more effective, and their courts more efficient.
When the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost:90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master plans, to combat crime in their area;60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on crime;50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police academy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best trained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere.
We will also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from becoming adult delinquents.
We will seek new partnerships with States and cities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem.
And we will recommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.
At the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free Americaas Abraham Lincoln once saidmust let reverence for the laws.
become the political religion of the Nation.
Our country's laws must be respected.
Order must be maintained.
And I will supportwith all the constitutional powers the President possessesour Nation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our communities.
Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have already been laid.
Some will necessarily be small at first, but every beginning is a consequence.
If we postpone this urgent work now, it will simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.
Our fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead, moving ahead steadily and safely.
We have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity.
Last year, in 1966:Wages were the highest in history-and the unemployment rate, announced yesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years;Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent;Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;Our gross national product advanced 5.
5 percent, to about $740 billion;Income per farm went up 6 percent.
Now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.
5 percent over the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam.
This was more than we had expectedand the Government tried to do everything that we knew how to do to hold it down.
Yet we were not as successful as we wished to be.
In the 18 months after we entered World War II, prices rose not 4.
5 percent, but 13.
5 percent.
In the first 18 months after Korea, after the conflict broke out there, prices rose not 4.
5 percent, but 11 percent.
During those two periods we had OPA price control that the Congress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.
Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to avoid imposing them.
We believe that we have done better, but we make no pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.
Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit.
They imposed very severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders, and all those associated with the home industry.
Last January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and moderate tax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion.
Legislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the economy.
With these measures, in both instances, the Congress approved most of the recommendations rather promptly.
As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored.
Wholesale prices are lower tonight than they were in August.
So are retail food prices.
Monetary conditions are also easing.
Most interest rates have retreated from their earlier peaks.
More money now seems to be available.
Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly seek, I am confident that this movement can continue.
I pledge the American people that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest rates and to ease money in this country.
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to savings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.
We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals; that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the progress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and toward lower interest rates.
I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxesto last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue.
I will promptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these expenditures permits it.
This surcharge will raise revenues by some $4.
5 billion in the first year.
For example, a person whose tax payment, the tax he owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an extra $60 over the 12-month period, or $5 a month.
The overwhelming majority of Americans who pay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $5 a month.
Married couples with two children, with incomes up to $5,000 per year, will be exempt from this taxas will single people with an income of up to $1,900 a year.
Now if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect when I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual taxes would have been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates.
So this proposal is that while we have this problem and this emergency in Vietnam, while we are trying to meet the needs of our people at home, your Government asks for slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give our country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of trial.
For fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.
7 billion and revenues of $117 billion.
That will leave us a deficit this year of $9.
7 billion.
For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion.
And with the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate revenues will be $126.
9 billion.
The deficit then will be $8.
1 billion.
I will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress.
Yours is the responsibility to discuss and to debate them-to approve or modify or reject them.
I welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a colleague and as Vice President and President.
I should like to say to the Members of the oppositionwhose numbers, if I am not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhatthat the genius of the American political system has always been best expressed through creative debate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives.
Throughout our history, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to understand this.
So let there be light and reason in our relations.
That is the way to a responsible session and a responsive government.
Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the quality of life for every Americannot just the rich, not just the poor, but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.
We all go to schoolto good schools or bad schools.
We all take air into our lungs-clean air or polluted air.
We all drink waterpure water or polluted water.
We all face sickness someday, and some more often than we wish, and old age as well.
We all have a stake in this Great Societyin its economic growth, in reduction of civil strifea great stake in good government.
We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this country in these years.
Our children's children will pay the price if we are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.
Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change.
But abroad, as at home, there is a greater risk in standing still.
No part of our foreign policy is so sacred that it ever remains beyond review.
We shall be flexible where conditions in the world changeand where man's efforts can change them for the better.
We are in the midst of a great transition-a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet.
In Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly to give our hemispheric policies new direction.
We have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American effort in economic and social development was launched by the conference at Bogota in 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower.
The Alliance for Progress moved dramatically forward under President Kennedy.
There is new confidence that the voice of the people is being heard; that the dignity of the individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere, and we are facing up to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together.
In this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happenbecause it has happened.
So together, I think, we must now move to strike down the barriers to full cooperation among the American nations, and to free the energies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our citizens.
Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America.
It has yet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above all, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible.
There, too, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa cooperate on a regional basis.
More and more our programs for Africa are going to be directed toward self-help.
The future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts.
Our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those who are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races, and to help those who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence.
In the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately, has not yet taken hold.
An already tortured peace seems to be constantly threatened.
We shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities of improved relations among the nations of that region.
We are working hard at that task.
In the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the earth's population.
Over the years weand othershave invested very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and Pakistan.
We are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict.
It must strengthen their capacity to help themselves.
It must help these two nationsboth our friendsto overcome poverty, to emerge as self-reliant leaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation.
In Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common defense.
But we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved through measures of arms control and disarmament, and through other forms of practical agreement.
We are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs, in economic and technical cooperation, in trade negotiations, in political consultation, and in working together with the governments and peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve when we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild Europe.
We faced new challenges and opportunities then and thereand we faced also some dangers.
But I believe that the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both sides of this Chamber, wanted to face them together.
Our relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in transition.
We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war.
When we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for that matter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and without venom.
Our objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it.
We have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses of outer space.
We have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.
We have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.
We are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial credits to Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to Romania and Yugoslavia.
We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another 2 years.
We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to embassies.
We have started discussions with international agencies on ways of increasing contacts with Eastern European countries.
This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world that were entered into before I became President.
So tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by approving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile capabilities.
It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile defense.
My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our allies.
I would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and the United States is in our common interest, in arms control and in disarmament.
We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us, if that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons and defenses.
I thought we were making some progress in that direction the first few months I was in office.
I realize that any additional race would impose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an additional waste of resources with no gain in security to either side.
I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the Congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing directly upon this problem.
Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human family is the race between food supply and population increase.
That race tonight is being lost.
The time for rhetoric has clearly passed.
The time for concerted action is here and we must get on with the job.
We believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed: First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food production, including the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise.
Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into voluntary family planning programs.
And third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves.
Every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance.
I come now finally to Southeast Asia-and to Vietnam in particular.
Soon I will submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation.
Tonight I want to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.
We are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies are committed by the SEATO Treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in Southeast Asia.
We are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the United States, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically violated by the Communists.
That violation threatens the independence of all the small nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world.
We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to remain non-Communistif that is what they choose-as North Vietnam has to remain Communist.
We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression.
No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by the great Thomas Jefferson:It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater.
We have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to prevent a larger wara war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the Communists succeed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by aggression and by force.
I believe, and I am supported by some authority, that if they are not checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them later.
That is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that is why it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago.
You will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago.
Is there anyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was not changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggressionthis time it was in Korea.
Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had failed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south.
The Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as we said 16 years ago in Korea: This far and no further.
I think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a stubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to settle political questions.
I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over.
This I cannot do.
We face more cost, more loss, and more agony.
For the end is not yet.
I cannot promise you that it will come this yearor come next year.
Our adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting longer than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to stand up and resist.
Our men in that areathere are nearly 500,000 nowhave borne well the burden and the heat of the day.
Their efforts have deprived the Communist enemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago.
We have steadily frustrated his main forces.
General Westmoreland reports that the enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield.
So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustainedand will be sustained-until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more than he can ever gain.
I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resourceof laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade.
That, and patienceand I mean a great deal of patience.
Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight.
Because they must provide real security to the people living in the countryside.
And this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces.
It means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they can respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in, and that they can have a personal stake in.
We hope that government is now beginning to emerge.
While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the very distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that South Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency.
We can help, but only they can win this part of the war.
Their task is to build and protect a new life in each rural province.
One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.
It is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence is not going to be slammed shut.
They know that it is possible for them to choose their own national destinieswithout coercion.
The 'performance of our men in Vietnam-backed by the American peoplehas created a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of Asia and the Pacific.
I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent in their homes and in their countries.
Fear of external Communist conquest in many Asian nations is already subsidingand with this, the spirit of hope is rising.
For the first time in history, a common outlook and common institutions are already emerging.
This forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of Asian nations themselves.
It was precisely this movement that we hoped to accelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965, and I pledged a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that part of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we were spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production.
Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of the billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the Congress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are already open.
Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new directions.
Their hopes are high.
Their faith is strong.
Their confidence is deep.
And even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying forward this constructive historic development.
As recommended by the Eugene Black mission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a special authorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian regional programs.
We are eager to turn our resources to peace.
Our efforts in behalf of humanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary line.
The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask the Congress for funds to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam-and their deserving neighbors who wish our help.
We shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of Mainland China and the world communityincluding working together in all the tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate of the Chinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends.
We would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her neighbors' rights.
We would be the first to applaud her were she to apply her great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people.
And we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for security and friendly relations with her neighboring countries.
Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that we, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam through to an honorable peace.
We will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and others, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional discussions of peaceanywhere, any time.
And we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.
Until such efforts succeed, or until the infiltration ceases, or until the conflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is that we just must firmly pursue our present course.
We will stand firm in Vietnam.
I think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest burden of all.
With their lives they serve their Nation.
We must give them nothing less than our full supportand we have given them that-nothing less than the determination that Americans have always given their fighting men.
Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is small compared to their own.
How long it will take I cannot prophesy.
I only know that the will of the American people, I think, is tonight being tested.
Whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time, and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to get it over with is inviting but dangerous; whether we can accept the necessity of choosing a great evil in order to ward off a greater; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the passions that are ordinarily loosed in time of waron all these questions so much turns.
The answers will determine not only where we are, but whither we are tending.
A time of testingyes.
And a time of transition.
The transition is sometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and often quite dangerous.
But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come.
We know that man is born unto trouble.
We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many men.
For all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations that concern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve, for all the issues we must face with the agony that attends them, let us remember that those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it.
But let us also count not only our burdens but our blessingsfor they are many.
And let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.
Let us draw encouragement from the signs of hopefor they, too, are many.
Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been found wanting.
So with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your support, we are going to persistand we are going to succeed.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I have been asked to give a statement about the consular convention that is pending before the United States Senate.
I should like to say very briefly that I hope the Senate will give its advice and consent to the proposed convention with the U.
SS R.
I feel very strongly that the ratification of this treaty is very much in our national interest.
I feel this way for two principal reasons: First, we need this treaty to protect 18,000 American citizens who each year travel from this country to the Soviet The convention requires immediate notification to us whenever an American is arrested in the Soviet Union.
It insures our right to visit that citizen within 4 and as often thereafter as is desirable.
We think that we need these rights help to protect American citizens.
These are rights which the Soviet citizens already have who travel in this country, because guaranteed by our Constitution.
Second, the convention does not require the opening of consulates in this country or in the Soviet Union.
It does provide that should any such consulate be opened, the officials would have diplomatic immunity.
The Secretary of State informs me that no negotiations for consulates are underway and that the most that he can envision in the foreseeable future is the opening of one consulate in each country, to be manned by from 10 to 15 people.
There are presently 452 Soviet officials in the United States who have diplomatic immunity.
If an additional consulate were opened, and if another 10 were added to the 452,  Hoover has assured me that this small increment would raise no problems which the FBI cannot effectively and efficiently deal with.
In short, I think we very much need this convention to protect American interests, and to protect American citizens abroad.
In my judgment, it raises no problem with respect to our national security.
Therefore, I hope very much that the Senate, in its wisdom, after full debate, will see fit to ratify it.
I will be glad to have any questions.
Cormier states a question that I know is on the minds of all the people here today and all the people in this country.
As you know, I have underlined over and over again the very deep interest of the United States in a prompt and peaceful settlement of all the problems in Southeast Asia.
I have said many times that we are ready to go more than halfway in achieving this result.
I would remind all of you that we would welcome a conference in Southeast Asia.
This might be a Geneva conference.
It could be an all-Asian conference, or any other generally acceptable forum.
We would be glad to see the unconditional discussions to which I referred in my statement of April 1965 at Johns Hopkins.
We would participate in preliminary discussions which might open the way for formal negotiations.
We are prepared today to talk about mutual steps of deescalation.
We would be prepared to talk about such subjects as the exchange of prisoners, the demilitarization, or the demilitarized zone, or any other aspect which might take even a small step in the direction of peace.
We would be prepared to discuss any points which the other side wishes to bring up, along with points which we and our allies very much want to raise ourselves.
Or there could be preliminary discussions to see whether there could be an agreed set of points which could be the basis for negotiation.
So it is against this background that we study very carefully all of the public statements made which appear from time to time and which bear upon Southeast Asia, and all the views which we receive from or through other governments.
It would not be helpful to meand I do not intend to do soto comment on any particular channel or communications at this point.
But you may be sure that we are diligent in our search for the possibility of peaceful settlement.
In all candor, I must say that I am not aware of any serious effort that the other side has made, in my judgment, to bring the fighting to a stop and to stop the war.
We have made clear that if the other side desires to discuss peace at any time, we will be very happy to have appropriate arrangements made to see that that is carried out.
Where we would talk, who would talk, what we would talk about are all matters that could be worked out between the two governments involved.
We have made clear to them, and to the world, the principles that we believe must govern a peace meeting of this kind, and a settlement that we would hope would come out of it: the honoring of the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962, the right of self-determination for the people of South Vietnam, to insure that they are freed from the threat or use of force.
But we have, I must say, as of today no indication that the other side is prepared in any way to settle on these limited and decent terms.
We hope very much that we can have some signals in that direction, but I in candor must say that as of now we do not have.
I think that any peace agreement will involve understandings on both parts and certain concessions on both parts and certain understandings.
I do not think that we can determine those before we come together, or through any press conference techniques.
I can only repeat what I said in the State of the Union: that I wish that the conflict in Vietnam was over.
And I can only repeat what I have said: so many times: I will do anything I can the part of this Government to go more than halfway to bring it to an end.
I must say that we face great costs.
We face agony.
We do plan to carry out our efforts out there.
We are going to support our troops in the field.
We are going to work with our Vietnamese allies toward pacification and constitutional government.
While we are doing that, every hour of every day the spokesmen for this Government are under instructions to explore every possibility for peace.
But I do not want to disillusion any of you.
And I do not want any of you to be caught by speculation.
As of this moment, I cannot report that there are any serious indications that the other side is ready to stop the war.
I see almost every day some speculation by some individual or some hope or desire expressed by some government.
And I assume that different individuals get different impressions.
Certainly they have different hopes.
I can only speak for myself, John, and with the information that I have, with the knowledge that is brought to me, I must say that I do not interpret any action that I have observed as being a serious effort to either go to a conference table or to bring the war to an end.
I think that there is little I can add to what the general public knows about the events in China.
I think that we all know that they are having very serious problems.
And I would not think that would add anything to the strength of our adversaries in that area.
I think that we can see from some of the problems that we have ourselves from time to time that unity is very important in connection with our operations.
And I do not see that the differences in China are going to contribute anything to the strength of the North Vietnamese.
On the other hand, I do not want to hold out any hopes to you that I do not have myself.
And I cannot say at this moment that the events in China are going to contribute immediately to the end of the war in Vietnam.
I stated in my Baltimore speech in early 1965 what we expected to come from the bombing.
We felt that it would improve the morale of the people in South Vietnam who felt that they had almost lost the war.
We felt that it would make the North Vietnamese pay a much heavier price for what they were doing.
And we felt that it would make the infiltration more difficult.
We think it has achieved all of those expressed purposes.
We cannot speak with cold assurance on the infiltration and the numbers each day, or each week, or each month.
In some quarters of the year our indications are that they increase.
In other periods of the year, the next quarter, they may go down Some.
I know of nothing that I can conclude as highly significant from the guesses and the estimates that we have made.
Just almost any step.
As far as we can see, they have not taken any yet.
And we would be glad to explore any reciprocal action that they or any of their spokesmen would care to suggest.
We have made one proposal after the other.
We would like to have a cease-fire.
We would be very glad to stop our bombing, as we have on two previous occasions, if we could have any indication of reciprocal action.
But as of now they have given none.
And I assume they are willing to give none until I hear further.
Well, I have not given a lot of thought to you in the press.
We have our problems with the press twice a day at our regular briefings.
I try to meet with them at least twice a month, in some manner.
And almost every day I see a collection of them on one subject or the other about something that interests them.
I think our system requires that, and I always try to reciprocate their understanding.
Now as for being President, I can only add to what I said the first day I was in this office: I am going to do the very best I can.
I need all the help that I can get.
I think the country, and the Congress, and the other nations of the world have been very willing to be reasonable in their relations with me.
I think all in all we have succeeded in obtaining some of our objectives.
I go to bed every night feeling that I have failed that day because I could not end the conflict in Vietnam.
I do have disappointments and moments of distress, as I think every President has had.
But I am not complaining.
And if you can endure it in the press, I will try to endure it in the Presidency.
Yes, I think it is quite a different Congress.
I think it is going to be a more partisan Congress.
And I think that it is going to be more difficult to obtain favorable action on administration measures.
I said after the first Congress after the election in 1964 that the President's mandate rarely lasted longer than 6 months, and I hoped that we could get most of the pledges we made in our platform enacted as soon as possible.
I have never tabulated it, but I believe Senator Mansfield made the statement that the Congress has enacted about 85 percent of our platform.
We still have some other things to pass.
We will win some and we will lose some.
We will try to work out an area of agreement where we can take some modified language in certain legislation we have to pass.
I do not want to anticipate more difficulty than I need to.
I am going to do with the Congress like I am trying to do with our adversaries in other places in the world: I am going to say to the minority party, which I do think appears to be able to find fault with almost our every act, that I want to meet them halfway, and I want their cooperation.
I want their help.
Because I do not believe it is good for the country to have partisan political in-fighting all the time.
We ought to reserve a few weeks before the election for that, and then all of us work for America the rest of the time.
I hope and believe that most Members of the Congress will feel that way.
There are many obstacles that come in the way in our attempt to reach all of our objectives.
I regret very much the incident to which your refer.
I am very hopeful that the government concerned will take appropriate, just, and fair action.
I am still determined that, notwithstanding some difficulties that may arise from time to time, that this is in the overall best interests of this country.
And I am going to continue to try to work toward that goal.
I have seen nothing that any of them have said that indicates any seriousness on their part.
I am awaiting any offer they might care to make.
They know that we are in contact with them.
I cannot speak for them.
But I am very anxious for them to make any proposal.
And we will give it very prompt and serious consideration.
Yes.
We still have our problems, but I think they change from time to time.
And I think there have been material changes in the thinking of various countries and their approach to their relations to other nations since World War II I am very hopeful that we can continue to try to evolve a satisfactory formula for getting along in this world.
And I am encouraged in that hope every day.
I see more encouraging signs than I do discouraging ones along that line.
I did not see  Staebler.
I do not know what he refers to.
I think he would be a better person to make that reply than I am.
The Democratic National Committee has a very competent chairman, vice chairman, chairman of the finance committee, and the deputy chairman.
All of those people were in the committee when I came into the Presidency.
While they have only had one national campaign since that time, it was very satisfactory so far as I am concerned.
And I think some people have used the committee as a kind of whipping boysome of them that really did not understand the functions of the committee.
I have worked on both the national committee, as an officer, and the congressional committee, as an officer, for many years.
It has never been the function of the national committee to take over the congressional elections.
We support them.
We work with them.
We aid them every way we can in the national committee.
But there are not many Congressmen that want the Democratic national chairman to manage their campaigns in their local districts.
And for that reason, we have a congressional committee and we have a senatorial committee.
It is my judgment that those committees are well run, well operated.
They did a good job this year.
And I know the Democratic National Committee gave them more support and more assistance and more effort than we have given in any period in our history.
So I do not know exactly what they are referring to.
I think if they had a knowledge of the situation, they would not feel as badly as they do about the present membership.
Thank you,  President.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen: I am sending a message to the Congress this afternoon asking it to act speedily to restore the investment credit and the use of accelerated depreciation for buildings.
I am asking that this be made effective as of today.
You will recall that last fall, when I signed the legislation temporarily suspending these investment incentives, I said then, and I should like to quote now:The legislation which I have signed provides for automatic restoration of these special tax provisions in January 1968.
If, however, any earlier reinstatement would be appropriate, I shall recommend prompt legislative action to accomplish that result.
That action is appropriate today, and I am so recommending action today.
Both the House and Senate committees which considered this legislation recognized the need to restore these incentives promptly once the suspension was no longer necessary.
It is now clear that the temporary suspension of these investment incentives has done the job that we hoped and expected it would do.
Interest rates began to decline last September-immediately after this proposal was first submitted to the Congress.
Since then, aided by actions of the Federal Reserve Board, interest rates have come down as much as 1 1/4 percentage points from their September peaks.
Treasury bill rates are down from 5.
59 percent in September to 4.
34 percent yesterday.
Interest rates on new municipal bonds are down from 4.
24 percent in September to 3.
60 percent now.
Last spring and summer, savings and loan associations had virtually no new money whatever to lend to home builders and home buyers.
In the past 4 months, they have been taking in deposits at a normal rate, and again have money to lend.
So we are beginning to revive the homebuilding industry.
Since the recommendations were made last September, the excessive pressure on our machinery industries has, we think, eased very dramatically.
After rising 28 percent from September 1965 to September 1966, order backlogs for capital goods have now already leveled off, and actually declined in January for the first time in more than 3? years.
Last September, the machinery producers were operating close to 100 percent of capacity.
Now their operations have moved down to a much healthier and much more efficient rate.
The acute shortage of skilled machinists has now greatly moderated.
Imports of capital equipment which had previously been climbing on an average of 14 percent a quarter, have already leveled off.
So this evidence of moderation in our economy has now been confirmed by the survey of investment plans for 1967 conducted by the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was released to you yesterday and published this morning.
A moderate increase of 3.
9 percent in capital outlay is planned for 1967, according to these estimates.
That is a very sharp contrast to the increases of 16 percent and 17 percent in the past 2 years.
So the actions that we took last fall, with the cooperation of the Congress, have helped to do what we thought very much needed to be done.
The imbalance in our economy that we were aiming at has now been righted.
We said that we would restore the tax incentives when appropriate, and when the suspension was no longer needed.
The suspension is no longer needed.
I propose that we restore the investment incentives, effective today.
I will be glad to take any questions.
Smith, we have help and suggestions from Members of the Senate, and from leaders in public life throughout the Nation and throughout the world.
I think all of us are very anxious to seek a peaceful settlement in Vietnam.
As far as I am concerned, the sooner the better.
We are ready to use any procedure that the other side is willing to engage in.
We have stated our position a good many times: the machinery of the Geneva Conference, the United Nations, an all-Asian Conference, or any other appropriate forum.
Individuals have different approaches to this matter.
I have the benefit of a worldwide network of trained diplomats.
I have the experience of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I have the judgment and recommendations of the Cabinet, the Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense.
I have constant consultations with our allies in the world, in particular our allies engaged with us in Vietnam.
On the basis of that information I must make judgments, and I do.
Sometimes those judgments are different from what other people, if they were in this position, would make.
I have no particular fault to find, or criticism to make, of others.
I just must act in the light of the information I have, exercise the best judgment I can, and do what I think is best for this country.
That is what I am doing without regard to personalities or politics.
Yes.
We have recommended a 6 percent surcharge.
We see no reason to change that recommendation.
The Ways and Means Committee is now busy considering legislation involving matters of deep concern to the administration, such as the social security bill.
We think by the time they get to hearings on the tax bill, the administration will be able to make a very good case, based on the economy, based on all the factors that that Committee must consider.
There are some doubts in Congress about the wisdom of it.
We will have to debate those out.
As of this time, I would see no reason why we should change the recommendations we made in our State of the Union Message.
I have tried to make it abundantly clear to all the people of this country and all of the people of the world that we are prepared to talk without conditions, we are prepared to talk about conditions, or we will talk about a final settlement.
I said to you I think the last time we met that this Government is always willing, anxious, and eager to go more than halfway.
But I must call to the attention of you and the American people that I do not think that we can stop half the war while the other side continues to kill our men, to lob their mortars into our air bases, to seize South Vietnam by force.
I just must repeat each day that we are ready to speak unconditionally or conditionally.
The problem with all of those who love peaceand I think most of us dois not with this Government.
We are willing to go to a conference room any day.
We are ready to go without stopping or after stopping if they are willing to do likewise, or if they are willing to make any concession.
But I do not think it is fair to ask an American Commander in Chief to say to your men, Ground your planes, tie your hands behind you, sit there and watch division after division come across the DMZ, and do not hit them until they get within a mile or two of you.
I do not think that is fair to American Marines or American soldiers.
We have talked before while acts of war continued.
We did that in Korea.
We had the blockade on in Berlin while we had conferences.
So we are willing to talk unconditionally, or we are willing to talk conditionally.
All we ask is equity and fairness, and that the other side do likewise.
We do not think you ought to ask the American boys to do one thing while other folks do nothing.
I think it is very difficult to speculate and give you a direct reply to that question.
I think our men have given a very wonderful account of themselves.
I no longer see any possibility of a military victory on the part of North Vietnam.
I think they realize it.
I think they are struggling desperately today to try to get a propaganda victory, and to try to bring world opinion and public opinion in this country to permit them to win here what they cannot win from our men out there.
No, there is no truth that I am looking for a successor.
Ambassador Lodge has talked to me on several occasions that he, in due time, would leave his post.
He left it on one other occasion, took a rest and went back and served a tour of duty.
There is no definite date set at this moment for his departure.
I do expect to be visiting with Ambassador Lodge and with General Westmoreland, as we do from time to time.
We will fully explore his future in Vietnam, or elsewhere, if he cares to do that.
I do not think any of us are happy to see our Nation divided and see our country upset about situations such as  Katzenbach is now studying.
I think it would be better for all of us if we were united and if all of us could agree upon a wise course of action and be free of any mistakes, any errors.
I regret very much some of the intemperate statements and some of the severe criticisms that have been made about various Government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency.
I have asked the best people in the Government to study everything they have done and to make a report to me.
I expect to receive that report sometime-perhaps by the middle or the 20th of the month.
Then I will review it and make such decisions as may be indicated.
We have talked about reciprocal military action in every pause we have had,  Bailey.
We have had five pauses now.
On the first pause of 5 days we made it very clear that we were taking this action and we would keep our ear to the receiver and listen intently for any indication from the enemy that he would take reciprocal action.
He turned our letter back to us on the third day of that pause.
Later, we had a 37-day pause.
We were told before we went into that pause by some of the same people who are recommending a pause now, or urging a pause now, that if we would go into it for 12 days or at the most 20 days, we could get reciprocal action.
We made it very clear that we would take the initiative and we would try to see if they were willing to pick up the telephone.
We went 37 days.
They gave us no indication that they were willing to take any reciprocal action.
We have just finished a pause of 6 days during the Tet period.
At the beginning of each of these pauses we made it clear that we were going to pause, ask our men to withhold action, and give them an opportunity to agree to come to conditional discussions, unconditional discussions, any kind of discussion.
We have just completed that 6-day pause.
So I would respond to your question by saying at the beginning of each pause we made it clear that we would take action, we would listen intently for action on their part.
We have.
We have heard the same story every time.
I see nothing in any evidence that I have that would give me any indication that they have had a change of mind, or that they are willing to take any serious action to stop this war.
I am searching every day.
I am following every lead I can.
I hope that we will find something at the beginning of every week.
But I cannot give you any assurance now.
Yes, I believe that the Russians genuinely want peace.
I think that most people in the world want peace.
Some want it on different terms.
I am hoping that the day will come when we can find some area of agreement.
But I do not think that that day is here yet.
We will just continue to try.
I think that it was evident from my statement thatfirst, I think it is generally known that I am glad that interest rates have fallen and have come down.
I think it is clear that they have been reduced from one-half of a percent in some instances to 1 1/4 percent in others.
I said in my statement today that that is in part due to the action of the Federal Reserve Board.
I am pleased with the action the Chairman and other members of the Board took that contributed to that.
I do not want to quarrel with anyone.
I think it is rather dear to me that they have laid down conditions that to me mean that they insist that we agree to permanent cessation of bombing before they might talk.
I think a good, general way to express it is what I said at my last press conferencejust almost any reciprocal action on their part.
We have said that we would be glad to stop our invasion of North Vietnam if they would stop their invasion of South Vietnam.
We would be glad to halt our bombing if they would halt their aggression and their infiltration.
We are prepared to discuss anything that they are willing to discuss.
But they are not willing to discuss anything, as of now.
Yes, we have reached an agreement that is satisfactory to us and in our national interest in a number of fields.
I do not think that I should take your time to enumerate them.
But the consular agreement is one that is now being debated.
Cultural exchange is another.
The space agreement is another.
We are working very diligently, although we do not know what results will be forthcoming, in connection with the nonproliferation treaty.
Discussions will soon begin in connection with offensive and defensive nuclear weapons.
Ambassador Thompson will participate in those discussions in Moscow.
We have exchanged ideas, and views, and reached agreements to the benefit of both countries and both peoples.
Well, I cannot speak for the opposition.
I can only speak for myself.
It has been many years since we had a thorough study of the draft such as we have had very recently by two distinguished panels, the Marshall commission and the General Clark commission.
I think they made many good recommendations.
I think there will be more yet to come that will flow from the debate in the Congress.
Unquestionably, in the field of the Selective Service boards and the draft machinery, as in the general machinery of Government at all levels, there has been discrimination against minority groups.
I will do all I can to see that that is corrected.
I do not believe our people want to see that happen or want to see that continued.
I expect that the system now being worked on by General Hershey and Secretary McNamara, when we issue our Executive order, will be a fair and impartial random selection.
I realize that there are differing opinions.
We will hear much of them during the extensive debate.
But generally speaking, I agree with the conclusions reached by  Marshall and his commission.
I stated this in my message to the Congress.
I want to hear the debate on the student deferment matter from both sides.
The commission was divided on that question.
And then I will reach a decision when the Congress has had a chance to act.
I did not know, Miss Means, there had been that much speculation about it.
I am not ready to make a decision about my future after January of 1969 at this time.
I think that down the roadseveral months from nowwould be the appropriate time for an announcement of my future plans.
I have never known a public servant that I worked better with or for whom I had more admiration, or who I thought was more entitled to the public trust than the Vice President.
I felt that way when I asked the convention in Atlantic City to select him.
I feel even stronger about it today.
Well, I am not sure that Presidents are objective viewers or listeners.
I recall some very distinguished President not many years ago saying he was reading more and more, and liking it less and less.
I guess all Presidents feel that way the longer they are in office.
I do think that  Komer brought back an optimistic appraisal of the situation in Vietnam.
I think that we have made great progress there.
It has been only 18 months since we sent our troops there.
I do not think we can expect any quick, overnight success story.
I will be receiving a report sometime later this month from both General Westmoreland in person, and from Ambassador Lodge, and from  Porter and all of those engaged in Vietnam.
We meet about every 6 months.
We will review in some detail our weaknesses out thereand they are legionas well as our strengths.
I am very proud of what the United States Government has been able to do in the last 18 months in that area.
I am very sure of victory.
I am very grateful to the men who are making sacrifices to bring it about.
Yes.
I have ordered a directive prepared.
The lawyers are working on it now.
Perhaps the secretary is typing it.
I will send later today a directive to the Attorney General to proceed on a Taft-Hartley injunction.
I think as you know, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service over the past 4 months has worked rather intensively but they have been unable to resolve this very difficult labor dispute.
The Secretaries of Defense and Labor and the Attorney General have recommended that I establish an emergency board.
I understand the Attorney General will very likely go to court in San Francisco perhaps tomorrow morning on the matter.
Just at any point that I had an opportunity, that I had a signal from the other side, of what their intentions were, what they were willing to do.
They have taken a rather steadfast position.
There has been little flexibility in it.
If I could get any sign from them or any indication from them that they were anxious to stop the war, that they were serious about it, that they were willing to talk unconditionally or conditionally, I would act very promptly.
Second, so far as the critics of the Vietnam situation are concerned, I must grant to them the same sincerity that I reserve for myself.
Now as to the extent of their information, I think that varies.
I think some men have more than others.
Some men have more opportunity to have it than others.
I am just not in a position to know how much information each critic of my policy in Vietnam happens to have at the time he makes his criticism.
I might say that it seems obvious to me that some of them do need more information sometimes.
Because when they make suggestions following a course of action that we have just completed, it makes me wish that all this information was available to everybody who is assuming responsibilities in the matter.
No, I expect we will meet them in the Pacific area somewhere.
I would expect it would be perhaps sometime this month.
I have had reports from them.
I think we have a very difficult undertaking.
I think it has been a very close question since the original target date was set.
I am very hopeful we will be able to keep it.
I do not think there is any guarantee that we will at all.
Yes.
Our people are always very anxious that every one of our men have the best and most modern equipment available at all times.
I have scrupulously inquired of General Westmoreland if our men are short of any supplies or any equipment at any time.
He has assured me that they have been amply equipped and amply taken care of.
We have, from time to time, helped other nations.
Some of the equipment we have had has gone to them.
Whether or not any equipment that has gone to them was desperately needed in any other theater, I would doubt.
I think that we can rely on commanders of the stature of General Westmoreland.
I think he is closer to the scene.
I think he knows more about it.
I think he is a better authority.
While I do not question either the purpose or the sincerity of the individuals who assume to make suggestions in this areaand I will carefully consider themat the present time I am going to rely on General Westmoreland's judgment unless somebody gives me something better.
Thank you,  President.
Lieutenant Governor Gorrell, Speaker Cummings, Governor Ellington, distinguished members of the legislature, and my friends: It is always a very special privilege and pleasure for me to visit Tennessee.
For a Texan, it is like homecoming, because much of the courage and the hard work that went into the building of the Southwest came from the hills and the fields of Tennessee.
It strengthened the sinews of thousands of menat the Alamo, at San Jacinto, and at the homes of our pioneer people.
This morning, I visited the Hermitage, the historic home of Andrew Jackson.
Two centuries have passed since that most American of all Americans was born.
The world has changed a great deal since his day.
But the qualities which sustain men and nations in positions of leadership have not changed.
In our time, as in Andrew Jackson's, freedom has its price.
In our time, as in his, history conspires to test the American will.
In our time, as in Jackson's time, courage and vision, and the willingness to sacrifice, will sustain the cause of freedom.
This generation of Americans is making its imprint on history.
It is making it in the fierce hills and the sweltering jungles of Vietnam.
I think most of our citizens have-after a very penetrating debate which is our democratic heritagereached a common understanding on the meaning and on the objectives of that struggle.
Before I discuss the specific questions that remain at issue, I should like to review the points of widespread agreement.
It was 2 years ago that we were forced to choose, forced to make a decision between major commitments in defense of South Vietnam or retreatthe evacuation of more than 25,000 of our troops, the collapse of the Republic of Vietnam in the face of subversion and external assault.
Andrew Jackson would never have been surprised at the choice we made.
We chose a course in keeping with American tradition, in keeping with the foreign policy of at least three administrations, with the expressed will of the Congress of the United States, with our solemn obligations under the Southeast Asian Treaty, and with the interest of 16 million South Vietnamese who had no wish to live under Communist domination.
As our commitment in Vietnam required more men and more equipment, some voices were raised in opposition.
The administration was urged to disengage, to find an excuse to abandon the effort.
These cries came despite growing evidence that the defense of Vietnam held the key to the political and economic future of free Asia.
The stakes of the struggle grew correspondingly.
It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the course in Vietnam, we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent Asia, full of promise and resolute in the cause of peaceful economic development for her long-suffering peoples.
But if we faltered, the forces of chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before us.
The choice was clear.
We would stay the course.
And we shall stay the course.
I think most Americans support this fundamental decision.
Most of us remember the fearful cost of ignoring aggression.
Most of us have cast aside the illusion that we can live in an affluent fortress while the world slides into chaos.
I think we have all reached broad agreement on our basic objectives in Vietnam.
First, an honorable peace, that will leave the people of South Vietnam free to fashion their own political and economic institutions without fear of terror or intimidation from the North.
Second, a Southeast Asia in which all countriesincluding a peaceful North Vietnam-apply their scarce resources to the real problems of their people: combating hunger, ignorance, and disease.
I have said many, many times, that nothing would give us greater pleasure than to invest our own resources in the constructive works of peace rather than in the futile destruction of war.
Third, a concrete demonstration that aggression across international frontiers or demarcation lines is no longer an acceptable means of 'political change.
There is also, I think, a general agreement among Americans on the things that we do not want in Vietnam.
We do not want permanent bases.
We will begin with the withdrawal of our troops on a reasonable schedule whenever reciprocal concessions are forthcoming from our adversary.
We do not seek to impose our political beliefs upon South Vietnam.
Our Republic rests upon a brisk commerce in ideas.
We will be happy to see free competition in the intellectual marketplace whenever North Vietnam is willing to shift the conflict from the battlefield to the ballot box.
So, these are the broad principles on which most Americans agree.
On a less general level, however, the events and frustrations of these past few difficult weeks have inspired a number of questions about our Vietnam policy in the minds and hearts of a good many of our citizens.
Today, here in this historic chamber, I want to deal with some of those questions that figure most prominently in.
the press and in some of the letters which reach a President's desk.
Many Americans are confused by the barrage of information about military engagements.
They long for the capsule summary which has kept tabs on our previous wars, a line on the map that divides friend from foe.
Precisely what, they ask, is our military situation, and what are the prospects of victory?The first answer is that Vietnam is aggression in a new guise, as far removed from trench warfare as the rifle from the longbow.
This is a war of infiltration, of subversion, of ambush.
Pitched battles are very rare, and even more rarely are they decisive.
Today, more than 1 million men from the Republic of Vietnam and its six allies are engaged in the order of battle.
Despite continuing increases in North Vietnam infiltration, this strengthening of allied forces in 1966, under the brilliant leadership of General Westmoreland, was instrumental in reversing the whole course of this war.
We estimate that 55,000 North Vietnamese and Vietcong were killed in 1966, compared with 35,000 the previous year.
Many more were wounded, and more than 20,000 defected.
By contrast, 9,500 South Vietnamese, more than 5,000 Americans, and 600 from other allied forces were killed in action.
The Vietnamese Army achieved a 1966 average of two weapons captured from the Vietcong to every one lost, a dramatic turn around from the previous 2 years.
Allied forces have made several successful sweeps through territories that were formerly considered Vietcong sanctuaries only a short time ago.
These operations not only cost the enemy large numbers of men and weapons, but are very damaging to his morale.
Well, what does all of this mean? Will the North Vietnamese change their tactics? Will there be less infiltration of main units? Will there be more of guerrilla warfare?The actual truth is we just do not know.
What we do know is that General Westmoreland's strategy is producing results, that our military situation has substantially improved, that our military success has permitted the groundwork to be laid for a pacification program which is the long-run key to an independent South Vietnam.
Since February 1965, our military operations have included selective bombing of military targets in North Vietnam.
Our purposes are three:To back our fighting men by denying the enemy a sanctuary;To exact a penalty against North Vietnam for her flagrant violations of the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962;To limit the flow, or to substantially increase the cost of infiltration of men and material from North Vietnam.
All of our intelligence confirms that we have been successful.
Yet, some of our people object strongly to this aspect of our policy.
Must we bomb, many people ask.
Does it do any military good? Is it consistent with America's limited objectives? Is it an inhuman act that is aimed at civilians?On the question of military utility, I can only report the firm belief of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency, General Westmoreland and our commanders in the field, and all the courses of information and advice available to the Commander in Chief and that is that the bombing is causing serious disruption and is bringing about added burdens to the North Vietnamese infiltration effort.
We know, for example, that half a million people are kept busy just repairing damage to bridges, roads, railroads, and other strategic facilities, and in air and coastal defense and repair of powerplants.
I also want to say categorically that it is not the position of the American Government that the bombing will be decisive in getting Hanoi to abandon aggression.
It has, however, created very serious problems for them.
The best indication of how substantial is the fact that they are working so hard every day with all their friends throughout the world to try to get us to stop.
The bombing is entirely consistent with America's limited objectives in South Vietnam.
The strength of Communist main force units in the South is clearly based on their infiltration from the North.
So I think it is simply unfair to our American soldiers, sailors, and marines, and our Vietnamese allies to ask them to face increased enemy personnel and firepower without making an effort to try to reduce that infiltration.
Now as to bombing civilians, I would simply say that we are making an effort that is unprecedented in the history of warfare to be sure that we do not.
It is our policy to bomb military targets only.
We have never deliberately bombed cities, nor attacked any target with the purpose of inflicting civilian casualties.
We hasten to add, however, that we recognize, and we regret, that some people, even after warning, are living and working in the vicinity of military targets and they have suffered.
We are also too aware that men and machines are not infallible and that some mistakes do occur.
But our record on this account is, in my opinion, highly defensible.
Look for a moment at the record of the other side.
Any civilian casualties that result from our operations are inadvertent, in stark contrast to the calculated Vietcong policy of systematic terror.
Tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese civilians have been killed, tortured, and kidnaped by the Vietcong.
There is no doubt about the deliberate nature of the Vietcong program.
One need only note the frequency with which Vietcong victims are village leaders, teachers, health workers, and others who are trying to carry out constructive programs for their people.
Yet, the deeds of the Vietcong go largely unnoted in the public debate.
It is this moral double bookkeeping which makes us get sometimes very weary of our critics.
But there is another question that we should answer: Why do not we stop bombing to make it easier to begin negotiations? The answer is a simple one:We stopped for 5 days and 20 hours in May 1965.
Representatives of Hanoi simply returned our message in a plain envelope.
We stopped bombing for 36 days and 15 hot: rs in December 1965 and January 1966.
Hanoi only replied: A political settlement of the Vietnam problem can be envisaged only when the United States Government has accepted the four-point stand of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has proved this by actual deeds, has stopped unconditionally and for good its air raids and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
And only last month we stopped bombing for 5 days and 18 hours, after many prior weeks in which we had communicated to them several possible routes to peace, any one of which America was prepared to take.
Their response, as you know, delivered to His Holiness the Pope, was this: The United States must put an end to their aggression in Vietnam, end unconditionally and definitively the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw from South Vietnam all American and satellite troops, recognize the South Vietnamese National Front for Liberation, and let the Vietnamese people settle themselves their own affairs.
That is where we stand today.
They have three times rejected a bombing pause as a means to open the way to ending the war and going to the negotiating table.
The tragedy of South Vietnam is not limited to casualty lists.
There is much tragedy in the story of a nation at war for nearly a generation.
It is the story of economic stagnation.
It is the story of a generation of young menthe flower of the labor forcepressed into military service by one side or the other.
No one denies that the survival of South Vietnam is heavily dependent upon early economic progress.
My most recent and my most hopeful report of progress in this area came from an old friend of Tennessee, of the Tennessee Valley AuthorityDavid Lilienthal, who recently went as my representative to Vietnam to begin to work with the Vietnamese people on economic planning for that area.
He reportedand with some surprise, I might addthat he discovered an extraordinary air of confidence among the farmers, and the village leaders, and the trade unionists, and the industrialists.
He concluded that their economic behavior suggests and I quote him, that they think that they know how this is all going to come out.
Lilienthal also said that the South Vietnamese were among the hardest working people that he had seen in developing countries around the world, that to have been through 20 years of war and still have this amount of 'zip' almost ensures their long-term economic development.
Lilienthal will be going with me to Guam Saturday night to talk with our new leaders about the plans that he will try to institute there.
Our AID programs are supporting the drive toward this sound economy.
But none of these economic accomplishments will be decisive by itself.
And no economic achievement can substitute for a strong and free political structure.
We cannot build such a structurebecause only the Vietnamese can do that.
And I think they are building it.
As I am talking to you here, a freely elected Constituent Assembly in Saigon is now wrestling with the last details of a new constitution, one which will bring the Republic of Vietnam to full membership among the democratic nations of the world.
We expect that constitution to be completed this month.
In the midst of war, they have been building for peace and justice.
That is a remarkable accomplishment in the annals of mankind.
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, who has served us with such great distinction, is coming to the end of his second distinguished tour of duty in Saigon.
To replace him, I am drafting as our Ambassador to the Government of Vietnam,  Ellsworth Bunkerable and devoted, full of wisdom and experience acquired on five continents over many years.
As his Deputy, I am nominating and recalling from Pakistan,  Eugene Locke, our young and very vigorous Ambassador to Pakistan.
To drive forward with a sense of urgency in our work in pacification, I am sending the President's Special Assistant,  Robert Komer.
To strengthen General Westmoreland in the intense operations that he will be conducting in the months ahead, I am assigning to him additional topflight military personnel, the best that this country has been able to produce.
So you can be confident that in the months ahead we shall have at work in Saigon the ablest, the wisest, the most tenacious, and the most experienced team that the United States of America can mount.
In view of these decisions and in view of the meetings that will take place this weekend, I thought it wise to invite the leaders of South Vietnam to join us in Guam for a part of our discussions, if it were convenient for them.
I am gratified to be informed that they have accepted our invitation.
I should also like for you to know that the representatives of all the countries that are contributing troops in Vietnam will be coming to Washington for April 20 and 21 meetings for a general appraisal of the situation that exists.
Now this brings me to my final point, the peaceful and just world that we all seek.
We have just lived through another flurry of rumors of peace feelers.
Our years of dealing with this problem have taught us that peace will not come easily.
The problem is a very simple one: It takes two to negotiate at a peace table and Hanoi has just simply refused to consider coming to a peace table.
I do not believe that our own position on peace negotiations can be stated any more clearly than I have stated it many times in the pastor than the distinguished Secretary of State,  Rusk, or Ambassador Goldberg, or any number of other officials have stated it in every forum that we could find.
I do want to repeat to you this afternoonand through you to the 'people of Americathe essentials now, lest there be any doubts.
United States representatives are ready at any time for discussions of the Vietnam problem or any related matter, with any government or governments, if there is any reason to believe that these discussions will in any way seriously advance the cause of peace.
We are prepared to go more than halfway and to use any avenue possible to encourage such discussions.
And we have done that at every opportunity.
We believe that the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 could serve as the central elements of a peaceful settlement.
These accords provide, in essence, that both South and North Vietnam should be free from external interference, while at the same time they would be free independently to determine their positions on the question of reunification.
We also stand ready to advance toward a reduction of hostilities, without prior agreement.
The road to peace could go from deeds to discussions, or it could start with discussions and go to deeds.
We are ready to take either route.
We are ready to move on both of them.
But reciprocity must be the fundamental principle of any reduction in hostilities.
The United States cannot and will not reduce its activities unless and until there is some reduction on the other side.
To follow any other rule would be to violate the trust that we undertake when we ask a man to risk his life for his country.
We will negotiate a reduction of the bombing whenever the Government of North Vietnam is ready and there are almost innumerable avenues of communication by which the Government of North Vietnam can make their readiness known.
To this date and this hour, there has been no sign of that readiness.
Yet, we mustand we willkeep on trying.
As I speak to you today, Secretary Rusk and our representatives throughout the world are on a constant alert.
Hundreds and hundreds of quiet diplomatic conversations, free from the glare of front-page headlines, or of klieg lights, are being held and they will be held on the possibilities of bringing peace to Vietnam.
Governor Averell Harriman, with 25 years of experience of troubleshooting on the most difficult international problems that America has ever had, is carrying out my instructions that every possible lead, however slight it may first appear, from any source, public or private, shall be followed up.
Let me conclude by saying this: I so much wish that it were within my power to assure that all those in Hanoi could hear one simple messageAmerica is committed to the defense of South Vietnam until an honorable peace can be negotiated.
If this one communication gets through and its rational implications are drawn, we should be at the table tomorrow.
It would be none too soon for us.
Then hundreds of thousands of Americansas brave as any who ever took the field for their country-could come back home.
And the man who could lead them back is the man that you trained and sent from here, our own beloved, brilliant General Westy Westmoreland.
As these heroes came back to their homes, millions of Vietnamese could begin to make a decent life for themselves and their families without fear of terrorism, without fear of war, or without fear of Communist enslavement.
That is what we are working and what we are fighting for.
We must notwe shall notand we will notfail.
Thank you.
In the early morning today, Governor Romney communicated with Attorney General Ramsey Clark and told him of the extreme disorder in Detroit, Michigan.
The Attorney General kept me advised throughout the morning.
At 10:56 this morning, I received a wire from Governor Romney officially requesting that Federal troops be dispatched to Michigan.
This wire had been sent at 10:46 a.
m.
At 11:02 a.
m.
this morning, I instructed the Secretary of Defense,  McNamara, to initiate the movement of the troops which the Governor had requested.
At the same time, I advised the Governor by telegram that the troops would be sent to Selfridge Air Base just northeast of Detroit and would be available to support and to assist the some 8,000 Michigan National Guardsmen and the several thousand State and local police under the command of Governor Romney and the mayor of Detroit.
I informed the Governor that these troops would arrive this afternoon.
I also informed the Governor that immediately  Cyrus Vance, as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and others would proceed to Detroit for conferences with the Governor and other appropriate officials.
This plan proceeded precisely as scheduled.
Approximately 5,000 Federal troops were on their way by airlift to Detroit, Michigan, within a few hours.
Vance, General Throckmorton, and others were in Detroit and in conference with Governor Romney by the middle of this afternoon.
Their initial report was that it then appeared that the situation might be controlled without bringing the Federal troops from the Selfridge Air Force Base into downtown Detroit.
They, therefore, recommended to the President that the troops be maintained on a 30-minute alert and they advised that they would be in continual touch with the situation and with Secretary McNamara and me, making periodic reports about every 30 minutes.
At approximately 10:30 this evening,  Vance and General Throckmorton reported to me by telephone that it was the then unanimous opinion of all the State and Federal officials who were in consultation  including Governor Romney,  Vance, General Throckmorton, the mayor, and others  that the situation had developed in such a way in the few intervening hours as to make the use of Federal troops to augment the police and Michigan National Guard imperative.
They described the situation in considerable detail, including the violence and deaths that had occurred in the past few hours, and submitted as the unanimous judgment of all concerned that the situation was totally beyond the control of the local authorities.
On the basis of this confirmation of the need for participation by Federal troops, and pursuant to the official request made by the Governor of the State of Michigan, in which Mayor Cavanagh of Detroit joined, I forthwith issued the necessary proclamation and Executive order as provided by the Constitution and the statutes.
I advised  Vance and General Throckmorton to proceed immediately with the transportation of the Federal troops from Selfridge Air Force Base to places of deployment within Detroit  a movement which they had already provisionally begun, pursuant to their authority.
I am sure the American people will realize that I take this action with the greatest regret  and only because of the clear, unmistakable, and undisputed evidence that Governor Romney of Michigan and the local officials in Detroit have been unable to bring the situation under control.
Law enforcement is a local matter.
It is the responsibility of local officials and the Governors of the respective States.
The Federal Government should not intervene  except in the most extraordinary circumstances.
The fact of the matter, however, is that law and order have broken down in Detroit, Michigan.
Pillage, looting, murder, and arson have nothing to do with civil rights.
They are criminal conduct.
The Federal Government in the circumstances here presented had no alternative but to respond, since it was called upon by the Governor of the State and since it was presented with proof of his inability to restore order in Michigan.
We will not tolerate lawlessness.
We will not endure violence.
It matters not by whom it is done or under what slogan or banner.
It will not be tolerated.
This Nation will do whatever it is necessary to do to suppress and to punish those who engage in it.
I know that with few exceptions the people of Detroit, and the people of Newark, and the people of Harlem, and of all of our American cities, however troubled they may be, deplore and condemn these criminal acts.
I know that the vast majority of Negroes and whites are shocked and outraged by them.
So tonight, your President calls upon all of our people, in all of our cities, to join in a determined program to maintain law and order  to condemn and to combat lawlessness in all of its forms  and firmly to show by word and by deed that riots, looting, and public disorder will just not be tolerated.
In particular, I call upon the people of the ravaged areas to return to their homes, to leave the streets, and to permit the authorities to restore quiet and order without further loss of life or property damage.
Once this is done, attention can immediately be turned to the great and urgent problems of repairing the damage that has been done.
I appeal to every American in this grave hour to respond to this plea.
My fellow Americans:We have endured a week such as no nation should live through: a time of violence and tragedy.
For a few minutes tonight, I want to talk about that tragedy  and I want to talk about the deeper questions it raises for us all.
I am tonight appointing a special Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.
Governor Otto Kerner of Illinois has agreed to serve as Chairman.
Mayor John Lindsay of New York will serve as Vice Chairman.
Its other members will include Fred R.
Harris, Senator from Oklahoma; Edward W.
Brooke, United States Senator from Massachusetts; James C.
Corman, U.
S.
Representative from California, 22d District, Los Angeles; William M.
McCulloch, the U.
S.
Representative from the State of Ohio, the 4th District; I.
W.
Abel, the president of the United Steel Workers; Charles B.
Thornton, the president, director, and chairman of the board of Litton Industries, Inc.
; Roy Wilkins, the executive director of the NAACP; Katherine Graham Peden, the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Kentucky; Herbert Jenkins, the chief of police, Atlanta, Georgia.
The Commission will investigate the origins of the recent disorders in our cities.
It will make recommendations  to me, to the Congress, to the State Governors, and to the mayors  for measures to prevent or contain such disasters in the future.
In their work, the Commission members will have access to the facts that are gathered by Director Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The FBI will continue to exercise its full authority to investigate these riots, in accordance with my standing instructions, and continue to search for evidence of conspiracy.
But even before the Commission begins its work, and even before all the evidence is in, there are some things that we can tell about the outbreaks of this summer.
First  let there be no mistake about it-the looting, arson, plunder, and pillage which have occurred are not part of the civil rights protest.
There is no American right to loot stores, or to burn buildings, or to fire rifles from the rooftops.
That is crime  and crime must be dealt with forcefully, and swiftly, and certainly  under law.
Innocent people, Negro and white, have been killed.
Damage to property  owned by Negroes and whites  is calamitous.
Worst of all, fear and bitterness which have been loosed will take long months to erase.
The criminals who committed these acts of violence against the people deserve to be punished  and they must be punished.
Explanations may be offered, but nothing can excuse what they have done.
There will be attempts to interpret the events of the past few days.
But when violence strikes, then those in public responsibility have an immediate and a very different job: not to analyze, but to end disorder.
That they must seek to do with every means at their command: through local police, State officials, and  in extraordinary circumstances where local authorities have stated that they cannot maintain order with their own resources  then through Federal power that we have limited authority to use.
I have directed the Secretary of Defense to issue new training standards for riot control procedures immediately to National Guard units across the country.
Through the Continental Army Command, this expanded training will begin immediately.
The National Guard must have the ability to respond effectively, quickly, and appropriately, in conditions of disorder and violence.
Those charged with the responsibility of law enforcement should, and must, be respected by all of our people.
The violence must be stopped, quickly, finally, and permanently.
It would compound the tragedy, however, if we should settle for order that is imposed by the muzzle of a gun.
In America, we seek more than the uneasy calm of martial law.
We seek peace that is based on one man's respect for another man  and upon mutual respect for law.
We seek a public order that is built on steady progress in meeting the needs of all of our people.
Not even the sternest police action, nor the most effective Federal troops, can ever create lasting peace in our cities.
The only genuine, long-range solution for what has happened lies in an attack  mounted at every level  upon the conditions that breed despair and violence.
All of us know what those conditions are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, not enough jobs.
We should attack these conditions  not because we are frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by conscience.
We should attack them because there is simply no other way to achieve a decent and orderly society in America.
In the past 3 1/2 years, we have directed the greatest governmental effort in all of our American history at these ancient enemies.
The roll call of those laws reveals the depth of our concern: the Model Cities Act, the Voters Rights Act, the Civil Rights Acts, the Rent Supplement Act, Medicare and Medicaid, the 24 educational bills, Head Start, the Job Corps, the Neighborhood Youth Corps, the Teacher Corps, manpower development and training.
And many, many more acts too numerous to mention on television tonight.
We will continue to press for laws which would protect our citizens from violence, like the Safe Streets and Crime Control Act now under consideration in the Congress, and the Gun Control Act.
Our work has just begun.
Yet there are those who feel that even this beginning is too much.
There are those who would have us turn back even now, at the beginning of this journey.
Last week in Congress, a small but important plan for action in the cities was voted down in the House of Representatives.
The Members of that body rejected my request for $20 million to fight the pestilence of rats  rats which prowl in dark alleys and tenements, and attack thousands of city children.
The passage of this legislation would have meant much to the children of the slums.
A strong Government that has spent millions to protect baby calves from worms could surely afford to show as much concern for baby boys and girls.
There are some tonight who feel that we cannot afford a model cities program.
They reduced my request for funds this year by two-thirds.
There are some who feel that we cannot afford additional good teachers for the children of poverty in urban areas.
Or new efforts to house those who are most in need of housing.
Or to aid in education to those who need to read and write.
Theirs is a strange system of bookkeeping.
I believe we should be counting the assets that these measures can bring to America: cities richer in opportunity; cities more full of promise; cities of order, progress, and happiness.
Instead, some are counting the seeds of bitterness.
This is not a time for angry reaction.
It is a time for action: starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities.
The strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the streets.
But laws are only one answer.
Another answer lies in the way our people will respond to these disturbances.
There is a danger that the worst toll of this tragedy will be counted in the hearts of Americans: in hatred, in insecurity, in fear, in heated words which will not end the conflict, but prolong it.
So let us acknowledge the tragedy; but let us not exaggerate it.
Let us look about tonight.
Let us look at ourselves.
We will see these things:  Most Americans, Negro and white, are leading decent, responsible, and productive lives.
Most Americans, Negro and white, seek safety in their neighborhoods and harmony with their neighbors.
Nothing can destroy good will more than a period of needless strife and suspicion between the races.
Let us condemn the violent few.
But let us remember that it is law-abiding Negro families who have really suffered most at the hands of the rioters.
It is responsible Negro citizens who hope most fervently  and need most urgently  to share in America's growth and prosperity.
This is no time to turn away from that goal.
To reach it will require more than laws, and much more than dollars.
It will take renewed dedication and understanding in the heart of every citizen.
I know there are millions of men and women tonight who are eager to heal the wounds that we have suffered; who want to get on with the job of teaching and working and building America.
In that spirit, at the conclusion of this address, I will sign a proclamation tonight calling for a day of prayer in our Nation throughout all of our States.
On this Sunday, July 30, I urge the citizens in every town, every city, and every home in this land to go into their churches  to pray for order and reconciliation among men.
I appeal to every Governor, every mayor, every preacher, and every teacher, and parent to join and give leadership in this national observance.
This spirit of dedication cannot be limited to our public leaders.
It must extend to every citizen in this land.
And the man who speaks to break the peace must feel the powerful disapproval of all of his neighbors.
So tonight, I call upon every American to search his own heart.
And to those who are tempted by violence, I would say this: Think again.
Who is really the loser when violence comes? Whose neighborhood is made a shambles? Whose life is threatened most?If you choose to tear down what other hands have built,  You will not succeed;  You will suffer most from your own crimes;  You will learn that there are no victors in the aftermath of violence.
The apostles of violence, with their ugly drumbeat of hatred, must know that they are now heading for ruin and disaster.
And every man who really wants progress or justice or equality must stand against them and their miserable virus of hate.
For other Americans, especially those in positions of public trust, I have this message:Yours is the duty to bring about a peaceful change in America.
If your response to these tragic events is only business as usual  you invite not only disaster, but dishonor.
So, my fellow citizens, let us go about our work.
Let us clear the streets of rubble and quench the fires that hatred set.
Let us feed and care for those who have suffered at the rioters' hands  but let there be no bonus or reward or salutes for those who have inflicted that suffering.
Let us resolve that this violence is going to stop and there will be no bonus to flow from it.
We can stop it.
We must stop it.
We will stop it.
And let us build something much more lasting: faith between man and man, faith between race and race.
Faith in each other and faith in the promise of beautiful America.
Let us pray for the day when mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Let us pray  and let us work for better jobs and better housing and better education that so many millions of our own fellow Americans need so much tonight.
Let us then act in the Congress, in the city halls, and in every community, so that this great land of ours may truly be one nation under God  with liberty and justice for all.
Good night and thank you.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Question? The people of Vietnam are in the middle of an election campaign to select a President and a Vice President, and about 60 members of their Senate.
In October they will elect a House of Representatives.
From time to time there seems to be-from news reports and operations reports-accelerations, escalations, lulls, and other various types of descriptions of our activities out there.
Our policy in Vietnam is the same: We are there to deter aggression.
We are there to permit the people of South Vietnam to determine for themselves who their leaders should be and what kind of government they should have.
It is remarkable that a young country, fighting a tough war on its own soil, has moved so far, so fast, toward a representative government.
Since we first went to Honolulu, we have urged that steps be taken in this direction.
First the Constituent Assembly was elected.
Next a constitution was written.
At Guam that constitution was given to us.
A pledge was made that they would have free and fair electionsthat the people would have a chance to select a President and a Vice President, and members of the Senate.
In the last 2 or 3 days there has been a lull in the air activity.
That is because of the weather, and because those who direct our operations there felt it was necessary to restrain themselves and not to carry out certain targets that were available to them.
Our activity in the South is determined a great deal by what the enemy there is willing to do.
More and more here of latewe think that because of the losses he has suffered, because of the position in which he finds himselfhe is less anxious to engage our troops in combat.
As a consequence, last week we had one of the lowest killed-in-action rates that we have had in several weeks.
That is not to indicate that we will not have a bad week next week.
But weather, enemy operations, local conditionsall of those determine in some respect what happens between a lull and stepped-up activity.
So far as this Government is concerned, our policy has not changed.
It remains the same.
We are steadfast in our determination to make our pledges good, to keep our commitments, and to resist the attempt to take over this little country by brute force.
Well, I think that that is to be expected in all elections.
I have participated in a good many.
I have never known one where there were not some who questioned the efficiency of the election, the accuracy of the election, or the wisdom of the voters' expressions.
The date for the election has been set.
The nearer you get to that election date, the more charges you will hear concerning the individual candidates, concerning the methods they use, concerning the type of candidate you should select, and concerning anything they can question or criticize.
We do that in this country.
You will expect more of it in a young country that is really having its first overall national election under wartime conditions.
We hope that whoever wins, civilian or military leaders, will work together and will cooperate in the essential work that is ahead of them.
We realize that one of our most difficult periods is going to be between now and the early part of September.
We have realized that all along.
We have had to adjust a good many things in this country, as long as we have had a Constitution.
During the election period, we have to forgo a good many things.
We have to indulge ourselves the luxury of a great many rash statements and criticism.
You can expect that to come from South Vietnam.
We are going to do all we can.
It is not our election.
It is not our government.
We are not running things.
It seems to me this is a matter for the Vietnamese themselves.
But to the extent that our counsel is sought, and our advice is followed, we are going to do everything we can to see that we have an orderly, free, and fair election.
Ambassador Bunker, who is one of our most experienced men, tells me that he is hopeful that this will come about.
We have almost 100 measures pending in the Congress.
About half of them have been passed.
At the end of the Congress, in the last few months of any Congress, we try to make a maximum effort to clean up all the bills that are left.
We are very happy at the action that the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives took on our social security measure.
There are some matters that they brought into it that we had hoped they would not.
There are some reductions made that we did not favor.
But generally speaking, our recommendations were carefully considered.
The House acted in its judgment and passed by that overwhelming vote yesterday a measure that I think the Senate can improve.
I hope it will be sent to the President.
We do have a crime control measure that has been acted upon by the House.
We have a civil rights measure.
That has been acted upon by the House.
We have an Economic Opportunity Act.
It is now pending in the House committee.
We have a model cities bill that has been greatly reduced in the House, but I expect the Senate to act on it this week.
We have a rent supplements that the House cut out entirely that should be restored in the Senate.
We hope that it will.
We have the urban renewal measure-almost a billion dollars, some $750 million.
We have the urban mass transit, the urban research.
We have the rat extermination, the education billsome 15 or 20 measures that are extremely important to the cities.
I have talked to all the leadership about it.
I have talked to a good many of the individual Members about them.
I think there is a general belief that the Congress will consider all of these measures and, I believe, pass most of them.
We do not expect to get everything that we had recommended.
But we believe we will get most of it.
We think it is essential.
As I said in my letter to Senator Mansfield, we have housing legislation, we have rent supplements, we have model cities, and we have a good poverty bill.
I believe Congress will, in the last few days of this session, face up to all of these measures and pass them.
I heard that over the radio.
I regret, of course, the feelings of the family.
But I can understand the feelings of any parent who has lost a child.
When I heard it, I just wished that it was possible for me to have enough time to sit down and express the gratitude this Nation feels for the service of the young men such as the one who belonged to this home, and perhaps give them a little better explanation of what we were doing there, and why.
I would be glad to consider and discuss any proposal that would indicate it would lead to productive discussions that might bring about peace in that area of the world.
I am very happy that Chief of State Thieu and Prime Minister Ky indicate that after the election they are hopeful conditions would be such that productive discussions and negotiations could take place.
The United States is very anxious to meet with the representatives of the North Vietnamese Government at any time, at a mutually agreed place, to try to agree on some plan that will resolve these differences.
We have made a number of proposals ourselves.
As of this moment, there has not been communicated to us any change of position any different from that reflected in Ho Chi Minh's letter of several weeks ago.
We would, of course, welcome any indication on the part of the North Vietnamese that they would agree to a cease-fire, that they would agree to negotiations, that they would agree that if we had a bombing pause that they would not take advantage of that pause to increase our men killed in action.
No.
I think there are those who are taking a pretty tough drubbing out there, who would like for our folks to believe there is a stalemate.
But I have not been there.
I cannot personally say that I have observed all the action that has taken place.
General Westmoreland is there.
I have sent General Wheeler there within the month.
General Johnson, the Chief of Staff of our Army, has just returned from there.
General Larsen, a very able general who has been in the II Corps now for 2 years, has just returned from there.
All of these men think that the stalemate charge is nothing more than propaganda.
First I would like to make it clear that these air strikes are not intended as any threat to Communist China.
They do not, in fact, pose any threat to that country.
We believe that Peking knows that the United States does not seek to widen the war in Vietnam.
The evidence has been quite clear, we think, that the strikes were made against the major military staging areas and lines of communication where the enemy has been concentrating his supplies and troops.
The transportation routes and bridges over which those troops have been moved against our men have been hit.
We think that these targets are directly related to the enemy's capacity to move material into South Vietnam to kill American boys.
The targets to us were clearly identifiable.
They were carefully selected.
They were all within North Vietnam.
The strikes were made by the most highly trained pilots that we had.
They employed every human and every technical precaution to insure that the ordnance fell on target.
It did.
While everyone is entitled to his opinion-a good many of them express itthe tougher the going gets, the more difficult it will be for some to stay with us and go all the way, and last it out.
Nevertheless, we believe that if we are going to be there, it is essential to do everything we can to protect the men we have there.
We are going to try to provide the maximum deterrent at the minimum loss.
I think that we have pending before the Congress some 15 or 20 measures to try to bring about an improvement of living conditions in our cities.
They involve many hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Congress up to now has not seen fit to pass the ones we have requested.
We are going to urge upon them the program that we have recommended.
We would be glad to consider any other recommendations that may come, but I think we will be rather fortunate if we can pass the measures that are now pending before the Congress without material reduction in our recommendations.
For instance, the model cities program is designed to improve the ghettos in the cities of the land.
We asked the Congress for $2 billion 300 million.
They reduced that to about $1 billionalmost half.
Then we asked for the funding of $600 million of that billion for model cities this year.
They have cut that $600 million to $200 million.
Over the long runmany years ahead I am confident that we will make substantial increases in our expenditures in the dries.
If we can get the modal cities passed this year, if we can get the Kaiser commission's recommendations on the pilot projects for housing passed, if we can get good, sound poverty measures, if we can get our rent supplementsthe program that has already been thought out and worked outI would be very pleased.
In the meantime, we have a group in the Housing and Urban Development organization under Secretary Weaver and Secretary Woodas well as  Kaiser's committee-that has taken a look at every proposal that has been made with a view to determining what merit they hold and how far we can go in embracing them.
I think that one of the very serious problems we have in this country-all of the consumersis trying to insure that the farmers who produce the food we eat and the fibers we wear get a fair price for their products.
I do not think they have gotten a fair price over the yearsin line with the earnings of the workers in industry.
I talked with some of the farm leaders before the Des Moines meeting.
The Secretary of Agriculture brought in some of those leaders.
I think that this Government should give very serious consideration to evolving some kind of a program that will give the farmer an equity of fairness, on the same basis for bargaining for the prices of his product as we have for the workers bargaining for the wages they receive for their labors.
Now the particulars of that have not been worked out.
I just do not know how we can obtain it.
But I do think that the farmers are on the short end of the stick.
I do think that people are leaving the farms by the thousands and going into the dries.
I do think that is creating a very serious problem for us.
Today the farmer gets a smaller percentage of the dollar for the food that he produces for us than in any other period.
I would very much hope that the administration, at some date in the reasonably near future, could find some legislation that would give to the farmer a means of bargaining reasonably and collectively, as we permit our workers to do.
Sarah, you do not always clear up your critics that easily.
They will be with you before the vote, and they will be with you after the vote.
That is the way it is in a democratic society.
I have given a lot of concern and attention to attempting to get the agreement of the Congress on the course that the Government followed in its commitments abroad.
As a young Senator, I recall very vividly hearing Senator Taft speak on several occasions about President Truman's intervention in Korea.
He frequently said, in substance, that while he thought what the President did was right, he did it the wrong way; that he should have consulted the Congress and he should have asked for their opinion.
Now under the Constitution, the Congress has the right to declareto declarewar.
It was never intended that the Congress would fight the war, direct the war, take the bombers off the ground, put them back on it, or ground them.
But it has the responsibility to declare the war.
Senator Taft thought that President Truman, before he committed our troops in Korea, should have asked the Congress not necessarily for a declaration but for an opinion-for a resolution.
President Eisenhower followed that policy in several instances, asking the Congress for an opinion.
He discussed it with the leaders before he submitted the resolution.
Back in May and June 1964, before the Tonkin Gulf, we considered what we should do in order to keep the Congress informed, to keep them in place, and to keep them in agreement with what our action should be there in case of contingencies.
There was very active debate in the Government, as I remember it, back as far as May and June of that year.
Then we had the Tonkin Gulf.
After the Tonkin Gulf we responded to the action with appropriate measures in the Tonkin Gulf.
But after that, we felt that we should point out that there was likelihood there would be other instances.
We could see the problem developing in that area.
So we asked the leadership of the Congress to come to the White House.
We reviewed with them Senator Taft's statements about Korea, and the actions that President Eisenhower had taken, and asked their judgment about the resolution that would give us the opinion of the Congress.
We were informed that a resolution was thought desirable.
So the members of the executive and legislative branches talked about the content of that resolution.
A resolution was drafted.
That was reviewed with the leaders on, I believe, August 4, 1964.
I sent a message up to the Congress shortly afterwards and asked for consideration of a resolution.
Some of the Members of the Congress felt that they should amend the resolution, even after amendments had already been put into it by Members, to provide that if at any time the Congress felt that the authority delegated in the resolution should be withdrawn, the Congress, without waiting for a recommendation from the President he might differ with them-could withdraw that authority by just passing a resolution which did not require the President's veto.
They could do it by themselves.
That suggestion was made to me by a prominent Senator.
I readily accepted.
So the machinery is there any time the Congress desires to withdraw its views on the matter.
We stated then, and we repeat now, we did not think the resolution was necessary to do what we did and what we are doing.
But we thought it was desirable.
We thought if we were going to ask them to stay the whole route, and if we expected them to be there on the landing, we ought to ask them to be there on the takeoff.
So Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara went before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee.
Then they went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee.
They testified before all four of those committees.
As I said, they accepted some suggestions by the Congressmen and Senators, and amended the resolution.
The committees reported the resolution.
I believe the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House reported unanimously.
The Armed Services Committee went along with it.
On the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate, I think there was only one vote against itSenator Morse.
Then it went out to both Chambers for debate.
We had stated our views in the message and in the measure.
The leadership, too, expressed our views in some of their statements.
On August 5th, 6th, and 7th, during that period, there was debate, 2 days in the SenateI believe on the 6th and 7th.
I do not recall the dates exactly in the House.
But that resolution was sent to us by a vote of over 500 to 2.
I believe that every Congressman and most of the Senators knew what that resolution said.
That resolution authorized the President-and expressed the Congress willingness to go along with the Presidentto do whatever was necessary to deter aggression.
Now we are, as I say, trying to provide a maximum deterrent with a minimum loss.
We think we are well within the grounds of our constitutional responsibility.
We think we are well within the rights of what the Congress said in its resolution.
The remedy is there if we have acted unwisely or improperly.
It is going to be tougher as it gets along.
The longer the fighting lasts, the more sacrifice is required in men and materiel; the more dissent, the more difficult it is going to be.
But I do not believe we are acting beyond our constitutional responsibility.
The Secretary of the Interior, since the Middle East crisis, has had a very special group in his Department dealing with imports and production matters.
His various advisory committees give him counsel as to emergency measures that could be takenand some that have been takento adequately protect our petroleum requirements.
They are reasonably well in hand.
We think that there is a great future in the oil shale development.
I would doubt that in this immediate crisis that you could expect any great acceleration.
But if at any time our petroleum supply should be threatened more than it is now, the need should become greater.
In any event just as the processes develop, you can expect further action in that field.
But I do not think it is imminent now.
Yes, from the 15 appropriation bills sent to the Congresstwo of which have been passed.
We are examining them now.
There is little indication that much in the way of savings can come from them.
We have talked to the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the House, where they originated, last week.
Mahon was here earlier in the morning.
We have pointed out the problem we have.
We have urged the leadership to set a target date for getting those appropriation bills to us so they can be examined.
There are about $61 billion worth of nondefense expenditures in the budget.
We would expect to have to get the Congress to reduce many hundreds of millionsperhaps several billions in those appropriations.
If the Congress fails to do it, we will have to see where it failswhat bills contain the money we think can be reduced and that have the lowest priorityand then act.
Each department has been instructed to immediately contact the chairmen of its subcommittees and urge them to take action on the bill.
When those reductions are made by the Congress, if they are not sufficient, then the Executive is pledged to make further reductions.
We believe we should try to keep our borrowing within 50 percent of the anticipated deficit.
We hope that we can get a tax bill that will raise about $7 billion-plus.
That will amount to about 25 percent of the anticipated deficit.
Then we believe by refusing to pass certain measures that have been proposedand are pendingby taking action on other measures that the House has reduced, by reducing several billion ourselves, the Congress and the Executive can reduce the anticipated deficit by some 20 or 25 percent in withholdings, deferments, impoundings, and actual cuts.
Thank you,  President.
Speaker Barnes, Governor Hughes, Governor Smith, Congressman Kazen, Representative Graham, most distinguished legislators, ladies and gentlemen:I deeply appreciate this opportunity to appear before an organization whose members contribute every day such important work to the public affairs of our State and of our country.
This evening I came here to speak to you about Vietnam.
I do not have to tell you that our people are profoundly concerned about that struggle.
There are passionate convictions about the wisest course for our Nation to follow.
There are many sincere and patriotic Americans who harbor doubts about sustaining the commitment that three Presidents and a half a million of our young men have made.
Doubt and debate are enlarged because the problems of Vietnam are quite complex.
They are a mixture of political turmoil  of poverty  of religious and factional strife  of ancient servitude and modern longing for freedom.
Vietnam is all of these things.
Vietnam is also the scene of a powerful aggression that is spurred by an appetite for conquest.
It is the arena where Communist expansionism is most aggressively at work in the world today  where it is crossing international frontiers in violation of international agreements; where it is killing and kidnaping; where it is ruthlessly attempting to bend free people to its will.
Into this mixture of subversion and war, of terror and hope, America has entered  with its material power and with its moral commitment.
Why?Why should three Presidents and the elected representatives of our people have chosen to defend this Asian nation more than 10,000 miles from American shores?We cherish freedom  yes.
We cherish self-determination for all people  yes.
We abhor the political murder of any state by another, and the bodily murder of any people by gangsters of whatever ideology.
And for 27 years  since the days of lend-lease  we have sought to strengthen free people against domination by aggressive foreign powers.
But the key to all that we have done is really our own security.
At times of crisis  before asking Americans to fight and die to resist aggression in a foreign land  every American President has finally had to answer this question:Is the aggression a threat  not only to the immediate victimbut to the United States of America and to the peace and security of the entire world of which we in America are a very vital part?That is the question which Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson had to answer in facing the issue in Vietnam.
That is the question that the Senate of the United States answered by a vote of 82 to 1 when it ratified and approved the SEATO treaty in 1955, and to which the Members of the United States Congress responded in a resolution that it passed in 1964 by a vote of 504 to 2,.
the United States is, therefore, prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.
Those who tell us now that we should abandon our commitment  that securing South Vietnam from armed domination is not worth the price we are paying  must also answer this question.
And the test they must meet is this: What would be the consequences of letting armed aggression against South Vietnam succeed? What would follow in the time ahead? What kind of world are they prepared to live in 5 months or 5 years from tonight?For those who have borne the responsibility for decision during these past m years, the stakes to us have seemed clear  and have seemed high.
President Dwight Eisenhower said in 1959:Strategically, South Vietnam's capture by the Communists would bring their power several hundred miles into a hitherto free region.
The remaining countries in Southeast Asia would be menaced by a great flanking movement.
The freedom of 12 million people would be lost immediately, and that of 150 million in adjacent lands would be seriously endangered.
The loss of South Vietnam would set in motion a crumbling process that could, as it progressed, have grave consequences for us and for freedom.
And President John F.
Kennedy said in 1962:.
withdrawal in the case of Vietnam and the case of Thailand might mean a cob lapse of the entire area.
A year later, he reaffirmed that:We are not going to withdraw from that effort.
In my opinion, for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of South Vietnam, but Southeast Asia.
So we are going to stay there, said President Kennedy.
This is not simply an American viewpoint, I would have you legislative leaders know.
I am going to call the roll now of those who live in that part of the world  in the great arc of Asian and Pacific nations  and who bear the responsibility for leading their people, and the responsibility for the fate of their people.
The President of the Philippines had this to say:Vietnam is the focus of attention now.
It may happen to Thailand or the Philippines, or anywhere, wherever there is misery, disease, ignorance.
For you to renounce your position of leadership in Asia is to allow the Red Chinese to gobble up all of Asia.
The Foreign Minister of Thailand said:(The American) decision will go down in history as the move that prevented the world from having to face another major conflagration.
The Prime Minister of Australia said:We are there because while Communist aggression persists the whole of Southeast Asia is threatened.
President Park of Korea said:For the first time in our history, we decided to dispatch our combat troops overseas.
because in our belief any aggression against the Republic of Vietnam represented a direct and grave menace against the security and peace of free Asia, and therefore directly jeopardized the very security and freedom of our own people.
The Prime Minister of Malaysia warned his people that if the United States pulled out of South Vietnam, it would go to the Communists, and after that, it would be only a matter of time until they moved against neighboring states.
The Prime Minister of New Zealand said: We can thank God that America at least regards aggression in Asia with the same concern as it regards aggression in Europe  and is prepared to back up its concern with action.
The Prime Minister of Singapore said:I feel the fate of Asia  South and Southeast Asia  will be decided in the next few years by what happens in Vietnam.
I cannot tell you tonight as your President-with certainty  that a Communist conquest of South Vietnam would be followed by a Communist conquest of Southeast Asia.
But I do know there are North Vietnamese troops in Laos.
I do know that there are North Vietnamese trained guerrillas tonight in northeast Thailand.
I do know that there are Communist-supported guerrilla forces operating in Burma.
And a Communist coup was barely averted in Indonesia, the fifth largest nation in the world.
So your American President cannot tell you  with certainty  that a Southeast Asia dominated by Communist.
power would bring a third world war much closer to terrible reality.
One could hope that this would not be so.
But all that we have learned in this tragic century strongly suggests to me that it would be so.
As President of the United States, I am not prepared to gamble on the chance that it is not so.
I am not prepared to risk the security  indeed, the survival  of this American Nation on mere hope and wishful thinking.
I am convinced that by seeing this struggle through now, we are greatly reducing the chances of a much larger war  perhaps a nuclear war.
I would rather stand in Vietnam, in our time, and by meeting this danger now, and facing up to it, thereby reduce the danger for our children and for our grandchildren.
I want to turn now to the struggle in Vietnam itself.
There are questions about this difficult war that must trouble every really thoughtful person.
I am going to put some of these questions.
And I am going to give you the very best answers that I can give you.
First, are the Vietnamese  with our help, and that of their other allies  really making any progress? Is there a forward movement? The reports I see make it clear that there is.
Certainly there is a positive movement toward constitutional government.
Thus far the Vietnamese have met the political schedule that they laid down in January 1966.
The people wanted an elected, responsive government.
They wanted it strongly enough to brave a vicious campaign of Communist terror and assassination to vote for it.
It has been said that they killed more civilians in 4 weeks trying to keep them from voting before the election than our American bombers have killed in the big cities of North Vietnam in bombing military targets.
On November 1, subject to the action, of course, of the Constituent Assembly, an elected government will be inaugurated and an elected Senate and Legislature will be installed.
Their responsibility is clear: To answer the desires of the South Vietnamese people for self-determination and for peace, for an attack on corruption, for economic development, and for social justice.
There is progress in the war itself, steady progress considering the war that we are fighting; rather dramatic progress considering the situation that actually prevailed when we sent our troops there in 1965; when we intervened to prevent the dismemberment of the country by the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese.
The campaigns of the last year drove the enemy from many of their major interior bases.
The military victory almost within Hanoi's grasp in 1965 has now been denied them.
The grip of the Vietcong on the people is being broken.
Since our commitment of major forces in July 1965 the proportion of the population living under Communist control has been reduced to well under 20 percent.
Tonight the secure proportion of the population has grown from about 45 percent to 65 percent  and in the contested areas, the tide continues to run with us.
But the struggle remains hard.
The South Vietnamese have suffered severely, as have we  particularly in the First Corps area in the north, where the enemy has mounted his heaviest attacks, and where his lines of communication to North Vietnam are shortest.
Our casualties in the war have reached about 13,500 killed in action, and about 85,000 wounded.
Of those 85,000 wounded, we thank God that 79,000 of the 85,000 have been returned, or will return to duty shortly.
Thanks to our great American medical science and the helicopter.
I know there are other questions on your minds, and on the minds of many sincere, troubled Americans: Why not negotiate now? so many ask me.
The answer is that we and our South Vietnamese allies are wholly prepared to negotiate tonight.
I am ready to talk with Ho Chi Minh, and other chiefs of state concerned, tomorrow.
I am ready to have Secretary Rusk meet with their foreign minister tomorrow.
I am ready to send a trusted representative of America to any spot on this earth to talk in public or private with a spokesman of Hanoi.
We have twice sought to have the issue of Vietnam dealt with by the United Nations  and twice Hanoi has refused.
Our desire to negotiate peace  through the United Nations or out  has been made very, very clear to Hanoi  directly and many times through third parties.
As we have told Hanoi time and time and time again, the heart of the matter is really this: The United States is willing to stop all aerial and naval bombardment of North Vietnam when this will lead promptly to productive discussions.
We, of course, assume that while discussions proceed, North Vietnam would not take advantage of the bombing cessation or limitation.
But Hanoi has not accepted any of these proposals.
So it is by Hanoi's choice  and not ours, and not the rest of the world's  that the war continues.
Why, in the face of military and political progress in the South, and the burden of our bombing in the North, do they insist and persist with the war?From many sources the answer is the same.
They still hope that the people of the United States will not see this struggle through to the very end.
As one Western diplomat reported to me only this week-he had just been in Hanoi  They believe their staying power is greater than ours and that they cannot lose.
A visitor from a Communist capital had this to say: They expect the war to be long, and that the Americans in the end will be defeated by a breakdown in morale, fatigue, and psychological factors.
The Premier of North Vietnam said as far back as 1962: Americans do not like long, inconclusive war.
Thus we are sure to win in the end.
Are the North Vietnamese right about us?I think not.
No.
I think they are wrong.
I think it is the common failing of totalitarian regimes that they cannot really understand the nature of our democracy:  They mistake dissent for disloyalty.
They mistake restlessness for a rejection of policy.
They mistake a few committees for a country.
They misjudge individual speeches for public policy.
They are no better suited to judge the strength and perseverance of America than the Nazi and the Stalinist propagandists were able to judge it.
It is a tragedy that they must discover these qualities in the American people, and discover them through a bloody war.
And, soon or late, they will discover them.
In the meantime, it shall be our policy to continue to seek negotiations  confident that reason will some day prevail; that Hanoi will realize that it just can never win; that it will turn away from fighting and start building for its own people.
Since World War II, this Nation has met and has mastered many challenges  challenges in Greece and Turkey, in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba.
We met them because brave men were willing to risk their lives for their nation's security.
And braver men have never lived than those who carry our colors in Vietnam at this very hour.
The price of these efforts, of course, has been heavy.
But the price of not having made them at all, not having seen them through, in my judgment would have been vastly greater.
Our goal has been the same  in Europe, in Asia, in our own hemisphere.
It has been  and it is now  peace.
And peace cannot be secured by wishes; peace cannot be preserved by noble words and pure intentions.
Enduring peace, Franklin D.
Roosevelt said, cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom.
The late President Kennedy put it precisely in November 1961, when he said: We are neither warmongers nor appeasers, neither hard nor soft.
We are Americans determined to defend the frontiers of freedom by an honorable peace if peace is possible but by arms if arms are used against us.
The true peace-keepers in the world tonight are not those who urge us to retire from the field in Vietnam  who tell us to try to find the quickest, cheapest exit from that tormented land, no matter what the consequences to us may be.
The true peace-keepers are those men who stand out there on the DMZ at this very hour, taking the worst that the enemy can give.
The true peace-keepers are the soldiers who are breaking the terrorist's grip around the villages of Vietnam  the civilians who are bringing medical care and food and education to people who have already suffered a generation of war.
And so I report to you that we are going to continue to press forward.
Two things we must do.
Two things we shall do.
First, we must not mislead the enemy.
Let him not think that debate and dissent will produce wavering and withdrawal.
For I can assure you they will not.
Let him not think that protests will produce surrender.
Because they will not.
Let him not think that he will wait us out.
For he will not.
Second, we will provide all that our brave men require to do the job that must be done.
And that job is going to be done.
These gallant men have our prayers-have our thanks  have our heart-felt praise  and our deepest gratitude.
Let the world know that the keepers of peace will endure through every trial  and that with the full backing of their countrymen, they are going to prevail.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I will be glad to take your questions.
We have previously considered and approved the recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the force level.
General Westmoreland discussed this at some length with me last night and this morning.
He anticipates no increase in that level.
I am generally familiar with that.
It is not a surprise.
I am aware that this has happened to the 35 Presidents who preceded me.
No public official, certainly not one who has been in public life 35 years as I have been, would fail to expect criticism.
There is a different type of criticism.
There is a difference between constructive dissent and storm trooper bullying, howling, and taking the law into your own hands.
I think that the President must expect that those in the other party will frequently find it necessary to find fault and to complain-to attempt to picture to the people that the President should be replaced.
It is also true in all parties that there are divisions.
We do not all think alike.
If we did, one man would be doing all the thinking.
So you have divisions in parties.
We have perhaps more than our share sometimes.
But I am sure the Republicans think that, too.
When you get into a political year, with the help and advice and the abetting that the press can do, and the assistance that the opposing party can dobecause it is to their interest to try to destroy you in order to have a place for themselvesand you take the divisions in your own party, and they concentrate, then it does seem to mount up and at times occupy a great deal of public attention.
But I do not think it is unusual for a President to be criticized.
That seems to be one of the things that goes with the job.
Not many of us want to say, I failed, or I made a mistake, or We should not have done that, or This should not have happened.
It is always easier to say that someone over there is wrong.
The President is more or less a lightning rod.
At least I have seen that in this country.
I remember, to take one or two illustrations, when President Truman very courageously and, I think, very wisely went into Korea.
One of our pollsters dashed out with a poll Gallupand found that that position was approved by about 81 percent.
Six months later, when the sacrifices were evident and the problems began to appear, the same pollster, talking to the same people, found that this had dropped from 81 to 26 percent.
Now, those things have happened in all of our criseseconomic, domestic, and international.
A President learns to expect them and learns to live with them.
The important thing for every man who occupies this place is to search as best he can to get the right answer; to try to find out what is right; and then do it without regard to polls and without regard to criticism.
North Vietnam has responded.
Their statement this week in the Hanoi newspaper in response to my statement from the Enterprise is very clear and very compelling.
It should answer any person in this country who has ever felt that stopping the bombing alone would bring us to the negotiating table.
Hanoi made it very clear in response to my appeal from the Enterprise that their position, in effect, was the same as it has always been.
It was the same as enunciated in Ho Chi Minh's letter to me which Ho Chi Minh made public.
There are some hopeful people and there are some naive people in this countryand there are some political people.
But anyone who really wants to know what the position of North Vietnam is should read what the spokesmen of North Vietnam say.
That is best summarized in  Ho Chi Minh's letter to the President that he made public, that is on the record, that he has never changed.
So all of these hopes, dreams, and idealistic people going around are misleading and confusing and weakening our position.
I would prefer to handle our negotiations through diplomatic channels with whomsoever we may negotiate.
I do not think this is the place to do our negotiating.
We are very anxious to find a solution that will bring an end to the war.
As we have stated so many times, we are ready to meet and discuss that with the officials of Hanoi and the Vietcong will have no problem in having their voice fully heard and considered.
But I think that it would be better if we would wait until opportunity develops along that line and then do it through our trained diplomats.
Well, I think we had better do that a little later.
I cannot tell all the good things that have happened or the bad ones, either, in these 4 years in a 30-minute press conference.
I would be charged with filibustering.
But we primarily want to think of the futureand not the past.
It has been almost two centuries since our Revolution and since we won our freedom.
We have come a long way during that period.
But we have much farther to go, as you can see from our education and health and city statistics, and farm statistics.
As long as there are four people out of every ten in the world who cannot spell cat, or cannot write dog, we have much to do.
I am particularly proud of what we have done in educationfrom Head Start to adult education, where men and women past 70 are learning to read and write for the first time.
I am very pleased, for instance, that we have raised our contributions from the Federal Government to higher education from 16 percent to 24 percent in the last 4 years, while the States have remained practically static.
We have made revolutionary strides in education, in health, in conservation, where we are probably taking in as much land in the public domain for the first time in years as we are letting out.
We feel that we have brought a degree of stability into our international relations to this hemisphere through the Alliance for Progress and our meetings at Punta del Este.
Working with other nations, we have made material advances in helping underdeveloped nations in Africa.
We are very pleased with what has come out of our meetings with the Germans and with the British in connection with our trilateral talks; what has come out of our Kennedy Round meetings; the several treaties that we have negotiated with the Soviet Union, and the one that we are working on so hard nowthe nonproliferation treaty.
We are happy that 9 million more people have good-paying jobs today than had them when I came into this office.
But these are things of the past, and we should accept.
They are here.
We want to preserve them.
But the important problems are ahead.
What is the next century going to be like? What is the third century going to be like?As long as the ancient enemies are rampant in the worldilliteracy, ignorance, disease, poverty, and warthere is much for government to do.
We are working on that now.
We will be talking more to you about that in the months ahead.
Well, I will repeat to you their assessment, because they are the ones who are in the best position to judge things locally.
I will give you my evaluation of what they have said.
First, I think every American's heart should swell with pride at the competence and capacity of our leadership in Vietnam.
I believe, and our allied people believe, that we have a superior leadership.
I think it is the best that the United States of America can producein experience, in judgment, in training, in general competence.
I have had three meetings with Ambassador Bunker and three with General Westmoreland.
I had coffee with him at length this morning, just before I came here.
Our American people, when we get in a contest of any kindwhether it is in a war, an election, a football game, or whatever it iswant it decided and decided quickly; get in or get out.
They like that curve to rise like this [indicating a sharp rise] and they like the opposition to go down like this [indicating a sharply declining line].
That is not the kind of war we are fighting in Vietnam.
We made our statement to the world of what we would do if we had Communist aggression in that part of the world in 1954.
We said we would stand with those people in the face of common danger.
The time came when we had to put up or shut up.
We put up.
And we are there.
We do not march out and have a big battle each day in a guerrilla war.
It is a new kind of war for us.
So it does not move that fast.
Summarizing and trying to be fully responsive to your question in the time allotted, we are moving more like this [indicating gradual rise].
They are moving more like this [indicating decline], instead of straight up and straight down.
We are making progress.
We are pleased with the results that we are getting.
We are inflicting greater losses than we are taking.
Amidst the horrors of warand more people have been killed trying to vote in South Vietnam than have been killed by bombs in North Vietnam, according to the North Vietnam figuresin the midst of all the horrors of war, in guerrilla fighting in South Vietnam, we have had five elections in a period of a little over 14 months.
There was great doubt whether we could have any.
It took us from 1776 to 1789not 13 months but 13 yearsto get a Constitution with our Anglo-Saxon background and all the training we had.
To think that here in the midst of war, when the grenades are popping like firecrackers all around you, that two-thirds or three-fourths of the people would register and vote, and have 5 elections in 13 monthsand through the democratic process select people at the local level, a constituent assembly, a house of representatives, a senate, a president and a vice president-that is encouraging.
The fact that the population under free control has constantly risen, and that under Communist control has constantly gone down, is a very encouraging sign.
The improvement that has been made by the South Vietnamese themselves in putting in reforms, in announcing other programs, and in improving their own Army, is a matter of great satisfaction to Ambassador Bunker and to General Westmoreland.
We have a lot to do yet.
A great many mistakes have been made.
We take two steps forward, and we slip back one.
It is not all perfect by any means.
There are a good many days when we get a C-minus instead of an A-plus.
But overall, we are making progress.
We are satisfied with that progress.
Our allies are pleased with that progress.
Every country that I know in that area that is familiar with what is happening thinks it is absolutely essential that Uncle Sam keep his word and stay there until we can find an honorable peace.
If they have any doubts about it,  Ho Chi Minhwho reads our papers and who listens to our radio, who looks at our television-if he has any doubts about it, I want to disillusion him this morning.
We keep our commitments.
Our people are going to support the men who are there.
The men there are going to bring us an honorable peace.
I do not know how it will affect the campaign in this country.
Whatever interpretation Hanoi might make that would lead them to believe that Uncle Sam-whoever may be Presidentis going to pull out and it will be easier for them to make an inside deal with another President, then they will make a serious misjudgment.
I will cross that bridge when I get to it, as I have told you so many times.
We want very much to have a tax bill just as quickly as we can get it.
We think the sound, prudent, fiscal policy requires it.
We are going to do everything that the President and the administration can do to get that tax bill.
I would be less than frank if I did not tell you that I have no indication whatever that  Mills or  Byrnes or the Ways and Means Committee is likely to report a tax bill before they adjourn.
I feel that one of our failures in the administration has been our inability to convince the Congress of the wisdom of fiscal responsibility and the necessity of passing a tax bill not only for the effect it will have on the inflationary developments, but the effect it will have on the huge deficit that we are running.
I think one of the great mistakes that the Congress will make is that  Ford and  Mills have taken this position that they cannot have any tax bill now.
They will live to rue the day when they made that decision.
Because it is a dangerous decision.
It is an unwise decision.
I think that the people of Americanone of whom want to pay taxesany pollster can walk out and say, Do you want to pay more tax? Of course you will say, No, I do not want to pay tax.
But if you ask him: Do you want inflation; do you want prices to increase 5 or 6 percent; do you want a deficit of $30 or $35 billion; do you want to spend $35 billion more than you are taking in? I think the average citizen would say, No.
Here at the height of our prosperity when our gross national product is going to run at $850 billion, when we look at the precedents of what we have done in past wars-in Korea when President Truman asked for a tax increase, people supported it.
This request has been before the Congress since last January.
They have finished most of the appropriations bills.
I read the story this morning.
It looks like out of $145 billion they will roughly cut a billion dollars in expenditures.
But they will cut several billion from revenues because of inaction, because people do not like to stand up and do the unpopular thing of assuming responsibility that men in public life are required to do sometime.
I know it does not add to your polls and your popularity to say we have to have additional taxes to fight this war abroad and fight the problems in our cities at home.
But we can do it with the gross national product we have.
We should do it.
And I think when the American people and the Congress get the full story they will do it.
We have failed up to now to be able to convince them.
But we are going to continue to try in every way that is proper.
I do not know how I am going to be, after all this opposition develops, so far as my state of health is concerned.
But I am very healthy today.
I do not know whether this criticism has contributed to my good health or not.
I do not know what Senator McCarthy is going to do.
I am not sure that he knows what he plans to do.
I think we had better just wait and see, until there is something definite there, and meet it when it is necessary.
There has always been confusion, frustration, and difference of opinion when there is a war going on.
There was in the Revolutionary War when only about a third of the people thought that was a wise move.
A third of them opposed it, and a third were on the sideline.
That was true when all of New England came down to secede in Madison's administration in the War of 1812, and stopped in Baltimore.
They did not quite make it because Andrew Jackson's results in New Orleans came in.
They were having a party there that night.
The next morning they came and told the President they wanted to congratulate him-that they had thought he was right all along, although they had come from Boston to Baltimore in a secessionist move.
That was true in the Mexican War when the Congress overwhelmingly voted to go in and later passed a resolution that had grave doubts about it.
Some of the most bitter speeches were made.
They were so bitter they could not be published.
They had m hold up publication of them for 100 years.
I do not have to remind you of what happened in the Civil War.
People were here in the White House begging Lincoln to concede and work out a deal with the Confederacy when word came to him of his victories.
They told him that Pennsylvania was gone; that Illinois had no chance.
Those pressures come to a President.
You know what President Roosevelt went through, and President Wilson in World War I.
He had some Senators from certain areas then that gave him very serious problems until victory was assured.
Now, when you look back upon it, there are very few people who would think that Wilson, Roosevelt, or Truman were in error.
We are going to have this criticism.
We are going to have these differences.
No one likes war.
All people love peace.
But you cannot have freedom without defending it.
At a time when the richest nation in the world is enjoying more prosperity than it has ever had before, when we carefully tailor our requests to the very minimum that we think is essentialthe lowest request that we have had in years-and then Congress cuts it 33 1/3 percent; I think it is a mistake.
It is a serious mistake.
When you consider that $1 billion that we are attempting to save there, out of the $850 billion that we will produce, we ought to reconsider that decision.
Because what we are doing with that money not only can give great help to underdeveloped nations; but that, in itself, can prevent the things that cause war where you are required to spend billions to win it.
I would rather have a little preventive medicine.
Every dollar that we spend in our foreign assistance, trying to help poor people help themselves, is money well spent.
I do not think we overdid it.
I do not think we went too far.
But I think the Congress has, in the reductions it has made.
Again, it is popular to go back home and say, Look what I did for you.
I cut out all these foreign expenditures.
But when the trouble developsthe people who are starving, the people who are ignorant, illiterate, and diseasedand wars spring up and we have to go in, we will spend much more than we would if we had taken an ounce of prevention.
No, I have not called anyone unpatriotic.
I have not said anything that would indicate that.
I think the wicked fleeth when no one pursueth, sometimes.
I do think that some people are irresponsible, make untrue statements, and ought to be cautious and careful when they are dealing with the problem involving their men at the front.
There is a great deal of difference, as I said a moment ago, between criticism, indifference, and responsible dissentall of which we insist on and all of which we protect-and storm trooper bullying, throwing yourself down in the road, smashing windows, rowdyism, and every time a person attempts to speak to try to drown him out.
We believe very strongly in preserving the right to differ in this country, and the right to dissent.
If I have done a good job of anything since I have been President, it is to insure that there are plenty of dissenters.
There is not a person in this press corps that cannot write what he wants to write.
Most of them do write what they want to.
I say want advisedly.
I want to protect that.
Our Congress wants to protect it.
But if I, by chance, should say: Now, I am not sure that you saw all the cables on this and you are exactly right; let me explain the other side of it, I would hope that you would not say I am lambasting my critics, or that I am assailing someone.
What I am trying to do is to preserve my right to give the other side.
I do not think one side ought to dominate the whole picture.
So what I would say is, let us realize that we are in the midst of a war.
Let's realize that there are 500,000 of our boys out there who are risking their lives to win that war.
Let's ask ourselves what it is we can do to help.
If you think you can make a contribution and help them by expressing your opinion and dissenting, then do it.
But then if the Secretary of State starts to explain his viewpoint, do not send out instructions all over the country and say: When he starts to talk and says ' Chair, man,' stamp your feet.
When he comes to the end of a sentence, all of you do this, and at the third sentence, all of you boo.
I am amazed that the press in this country, who insist on the right to live by the first amendment, and to be protected by it, does not insist that these storm trooper tactics live by the first amendment, too, and that they be wiped out.
I think the time has come when it would be good for all of us to take a new, fresh look at dissent.
We welcome responsible dissent.
But there is a great deal of difference between responsible dissent and some of the things that are taking place in this country which I consider to be extremely dangerous to our national interest, and I consider not very helpful to the men who are fighting the war for us.
Now, everyone must make that judgment for himself.
I have never said anyone was unpatriotic.
I do not question these people's motives.
I do question their judgment.
I cannot say that this dissent has contributed much to any victories we have had.
I cannot say that these various proposals that range from a Senator to a county commissioner to a mayor of a city have really changed General Westmoreland's plan much, or Ambassador Bunker's approach.
The papers are filled with it every day.
So I think you have to consider it for what you think it is worth and make your own judgment.
That is the theory of the first amendment.
We do not stop the publication of any papers.
We do not fine anyone for something they say.
We just appeal to them to remember that they do not have the privilege at the moment of being out there fighting.
Please count to 10 before you say something that hurts instead of helps.
We know that most people's intentions are good.
We do not question their motives.
We have never said they are unpatriotic, although they say some pretty ugly things about us.
People who live in glass houses should not be too anxious to throw stones.
I think our aims in Vietnam have been very clear from the beginning.
They are consistent with the SEATO Treaty, with the Atlantic Charter, and with the many, many statements that we have made to the Congress in connection with the Tonkin Gulf Resolution.
The Secretary of State has made this clear dozens and dozens of timesand I made it enough that I thought even all the preachers in the country had heard about it.
That is, namely, to protect the security of the United States.
We think the security of the United States is definitely tied in with the security of Southeast Asia.
Secondly, to resist aggression.
When we are a party to a treaty that says we will do it, then we carry it out.
I think if you saw a little child in this room who was trying to waddle across the floor and some big bully came along and grabbed it by the hair and started stomping it, I think you would do something about it.
I think that we thought we made a mistake when we saw Hitler moving across the landscape of Europe.
The concessions that were made by the men carrying umbrellas at that timeI think in retrospect we thought that was a mistake.
So as a consequence, in 1954 under the leadership of President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles, we had a SEATO Treaty.
It was debated, it was considered and it was gone into very thoroughly by the Senate.
The men who presented that treaty then said: This is dangerous.
The time may come when we may have to put up or shut up.
But we ought to serve notice in Asia now as we refused to serve notice in Europe a few years ago that we will resist aggression-that we will stand against someone who seeks to gobble up little countries, if those little countries call upon us for our help.
So we did that.
I did not vote for that treaty.
I was in the hospital.
Senator Kennedy did not vote for itthe late Presidenthe was in the hospital.
Senator Dirksen did not vote for it.
But 82 Senators did vote for it.
They knew what was in that treaty.
The time came when we had to decide whether we meant what we said when we said our security was tied in to their security and that we would stand in unison in the face of common danger.
Now, we are doing that.
We are doing it against whoever combines out there to promote aggression.
We are going to do whatever we think is necessary to protect the security of South Vietnamand let those people determine for themselves what kind of a government they have.
We think they are moving along very quickly in that direction to developing a democratic procedure.
Third, we are going to do whatever it is necessary to do to see that the aggressor does not succeed.
Those are our purposes.
Those are our goals.
We are going to get a lot of advice to do this or to do that.
We are going to consider it all.
But for years West Point has been turning out the best military men produced anywhere in the world.
For years we have had in our Foreign Service trained and specialized people.
We have in 110 capitals today the best brains we can select.
Under our constitutional arrangements the President must look to his Secretary of State, to his foreign policy, to his Ambassadors, to the cables and views that they express, to his leaders like the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and to General Westmoreland and othersand carefully consider everything they say and then do what he thinks is right.
That is not always going to please a county commissioner, or a mayor, or a member of a legislature.
It never has in any war we have ever been in been a favorite of the Senate.
The leaders on the military committees and the leaders in other posts have frequently opposed it.
Champ Clark, the Speaker of the House, opposed the draft in Woodrow Wilson's administration.
The Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committeewith the exception of Senator Vandenbergalmost invariably has found a great deal wrong with the Executive in the field of foreign policy.
There is a division there, and there is some frustration there.
Those men express it and they have a right to.
They have a duty to do it.
But it is also the President's duty to look and see what substance they have presented; how much they thought it out; what information they have; how much knowledge they have received from General Westmoreland or Ambassador Bunker, whoever it is; how familiar they are with what is going on; and whether you really think you ought to follow their judgment or follow the judgment of the other people.
I do that every day.
Some days I have to say to our people: Let us try this plan that Senator X has suggested.
And we do.
We are doing that with the United Nations resolution.
We have tried several times to get the United Nations to play a part in trying to bring peace in Vietnam.
The Senate thinks that this is the way to do it.
More than 50 of them have signed a resolution.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had a big day yesterday.
They reported two resolutions in one day.
I have my views.
I have my views about really what those resolutions will achieve.
But I also have an obligation to seriously and carefully consider the judgments of the other branch of the Government.
And we are going to do it.
Even though we may have some doubts about what will be accomplished, that they think may be accomplished, if it is a close question we will bend to try to meet their views because we think that is important.
We have already tried the United Nations before, but we may try it again because they have hopes and they believe that this is the answer.
We will do everything that we can to make it the answer.
I do not want to hurt its chances by giving any predictions at this moment.
We will consider the views that everyone suggests.
Thank you,  President.
Peace is the number 1 subject in the mind of every leader in the Government.
We are searching for it a part of every day.
We think that the people of South Vietnam have demonstrated that they want to be governed on the basis of one man-one vote, and people who are prepared to live under that kind of an arrangement could live under that kind of arrangement.
The thing that we must recognize about peace is that it is much more than just wishing for it.
You cannot get it just because you want it.
If that were true, we would have had it a long time ago, because there are no people in the world who want peace more than the President, the Cabinet, and the people of the United States.
But if we are to find the solution of uniting the people of South Vietnam, and solving the problems in South Vietnam, it must be done not by some Senator, or Congressman Ryan, or Senator Hartke, or Senator Fulbright, or some of our best intentioned people who want peace, This peace is going to be found by the leadership of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam, in South Vietnam.
We are encouraging that.
We are going to continue to do our dead-level best to see this constitutional government, where 70 percent of their people registered and 60 percent of their people voted, develop some kind of a plan that we think will ultimately unite South Vietnam and bring peace to that area.
This will take time.
This will take patience.
This will take understanding.
The great problem we have is not misleading the enemy and letting him thinkbecause of some of the statements he hears coming from usthat the way is cheap, or that it is easy, or that we are going to falter.
I have just explained what I thought would be a fair solution.
I will repeat it as briefly and as succinctly as I can.
The demilitarized zone must be respected as the 1954 agreements require.
The unity of Vietnam as a whole must be a matter for peaceful adjustment and negotiation.
The North Vietnamese forces must get out of Laos and stop infiltrating Laos.
That is what the 1962 agreement required, and it must be respected.
The overwhelming majority of the people of South Vietnam want a one man-one vote constitutional government.
About 70 percent of all the citizens who might have voted in South Vietnam registered in the election, and 60 percent of them voted.
The 20 percent or so of the population now under Vietcong control must live under a one man-one vote constitutional system if there is to be peace.
President Thieu has said that the South Vietnamese Government is not prepared to recognize the NLF as a government, and it knows well that NLF's control is by Hanoi.
And so do we.
But he also has said that he is prepared for informal talks with members of the NLF, and that these could bring good results.
I think that is a statesmanlike position.
And I hope the other side will respond.
That is why or statement in early December said we believe that the South Vietnamese must work out their own future, acting through electoral processes of the kind carried forward in the last 2 years.
The political future of South Vietnam,  Scherer, must be worked out in South Vietnam by the people of South Vietnam.
It is our judgment that this war could be ended in a matter of weeks if the other side would face these five simple facts, and if some of our own people here in this country would encourage that that be done instead of broadcasting alarms that may give false signals both to Hanoi and to the Vietcong.
I think that the thing we must bear in mind, that what happens in South Vietnam is up to the people of South Vietnam, not to North Vietnam, not to China, the Soviet Union, or the United Statesbut the people of South Vietnam.
We are prepared to have every man in South Vietnam under their constitutional government, one man-one votefor those people themselves to determine the kind of government they want.
We think we know what that determination would be from the 70 percent who are registered and the 60 percent who have voted.
It is a matter for them to determine.
I think that we might add one other thing here: When  Reynolds says what are the minimum conditions for this or that, we do not want to get sparring with each other.
But I can say that so far as the United States is concerned, we are ready to stop fighting tonight if they are ready to stop fighting.
But we are not ready to stop our side of the war only to encourage them to escalate their side of the war.
We will reciprocate and meet any move that they make, but we are not going to be so softheaded and pudding headed as to say that we will stop our half of the war and hope and pray that they stop theirs.
Now, we have tried that in some instances.
We have leaned over backwards.
Every time we have, they have escalated their efforts and they have killed our soldiers.
We have got no result from it.
A burnt child dreads the fire.
But if you want us to stop our bombing, you have to ask them to stop their bombing, stop their hand grenades, stop their mortars.
At San Antonio I laid out the formula and I said we will stop bombing immediately provided you will have prompt and productive discussions.
Now, that is about as far as anyone can go.
That is as far as anyone should go.
That is as far as we are going.
Well, it is my feeling that our position in the world is very clearly known.
If it is not, I have tried to repeat it enough tonight that the people can understand it.
I think that Hanoi feels that if they can hold out long enough, that they will not win a military victory against General Westmoreland.
They have not done that.
They cannot point to one single victory they won from our Marines, or from our Air, or from our Navy, or from our Army.
They think, though, that they can repeat what happened to them with the French; that if their will is strong and they continue to remain firm, that they will develop enough sympathy and understanding in this country, and hatred for war in this country, that their will will outlast our will.
I do not think that is true.
I think in due time, if our people will understand and recognize what is happening, I think they will help me prove it is not true.
Yes, I have said that I think the war could be stopped in a matter of days if President Thieu's suggestions that he informally talk with members of the NLF are carried out and if they would agree to what they have already agreed to in the 1954 accords and the 1962 accords and the other points that I mentioned this morning, like one man-one vote under the present constitutional government.
I think that would be a useful starting point.
And I think the result could be that we could find a way to stop the war.
They could have informal talks with them, Dan.
I said that the President had made clear that he would not recognize NLF, but we have made dear for many, many months that their views can be heard and we can respond to them; their recommendations can be received and we can react to them.
President Thieu, himself, in a very statesmanlike manner, has said that he would be agreeable to having informal talks with their representatives.
We would hope that out of that some understanding could be reached.
I believe if it could be reached, the war could be brought to a close.
Well, it was one of many statements, if you will look back upon it, as a part of a policy, namely, our policy then and now was to keep our hand out for negotiations and for discussions, and for peace, and our guard up that would support the South Vietnamese to keep them from being enveloped.
We made clear all through that campaign, and in this speech which you have extracted one little single sentence out of, that we felt that the South Vietnamese ought to pledge every resource they hadtheir men, their materials, all of their resourcesto defending themselves; that we would never supplant them.
But we would supplement them to the extent that it was necessary.
We did not plan to go into Asia and to fight an Asian war that Asians ought to be fighting for themselves.
But if Asians were fighting it for themselves and were using all the resources that they had in South Vietnam, there was no pledge, no commitment, or no implication that we would not supplement them and support them as we are doing, and as we agreed to do many years before in the SEATO Treaty, and as we had agreed to do in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution before that statement.
That has just been a part of the politicians' gambit of picking out one sentence before you get to the but in it, and say, We are not going to take over all the fighting and do it ourselves.
We are not going to do what Asian boys in South Vietnam should do.
They are doing it.
They have over 700,000 men there out of 17 million population, and they are raising another 65,000 compared to the additional 40,000-odd that we are sending.
So we do not plan to supplant them at all.
But we do plan to supplement them to whatever is necessary to keep the Communist conspiracy from gobbling up that nation.
I do not think that all people do everything alike.
I know some television broadcasters are better than others.
I know some Presidents that can perform in a conversation better than others.
General Abrams, who is giving leadership to the South Vietnamese people, thinks that their army is developing very well.
Now, that is not to say that they are equal to the best troops of every other nation, but they have made great improvements.
They are working at their job.
They still have some problems to correct in leadership.
That is what really determines what kind of a fighting force you have.
But they are getting at it and they are getting results.
It is mighty easy to blame someone else.
That is what we do.
I do not think we get much out of blaming our allies or talking about how much better we are than they.
Most of the people out there tell us that they believe that the South Vietnamese Army at this time is equal to the Korean troops in 1954.
If they are, I do not think we will have to apologize too much for them.
They are taking up their positions on the DMZ now.
They have been giving very good results from their actions.
General Abrams thinks they are doing all right.
I would prefer his judgment to anybody's judgment and I know.
Without going into your statements as to my views, I would say this: We are not sure just at this point of all that motivates the Chinese, or the Russians, or any of the other Communists who are supporting the North Vietnamese.
I do not think I could honestly tell you just what their motivations are.
We have always hoped that they would like to see this war brought to an end.
That has been their indication to us.
Whether that would work out in the long run, I do not know.
I think that the Glassboro conference was a very useful conference.
I am not sure that it really solved any of the problems of the Middle East.
I think the situation in the Middle East is a very dangerous one.
I think we have made clear our viewpoint in my statement of June 19th, the five conditions that ought to enter into bringing about peace in that area.
We stressed those to  Kosygin at Glassboro.
He understands them.
He did not agree with them.
But I think that the Soviet Union understands that we feel very strongly about this matter, that we do have definite views.
I think Ambassador Goldberg, at the United Nations, has made our position very clear.
As a result of the action of the United Nations, in sending Ambassador Jarring there as a mediator, we are hopeful that the conditions I outlined on June 19th can be worked out and that a permanent solution can be found to that very difficult problem.
I would say it is one of our most dangerous situations, and one that is going to require the best tact, judgment, patience, and willingness on the part of all to find a solution.
We do not have a SEATO Treaty, if that is what you are asking.
We have made clear our very definite interest in Israel, and our desire to preserve peace in that area of the world by many means.
But we do not have a mutual security treaty with them, as we do in Southeast Asia.
Well, there are a good many things said,  Reynolds, that people have to take with a grain of salt.
First, they ought to look at the sources of these statements.
I have tried to analyze our position in the world with other nations.
We do regret that we do not see everything alike with the Soviet Union or other nations.
We hope that there would not be this tension and these strains that frequently are in evidence.
Now, we do not say that everything is 100 percent all right, because we have very definite and very strong differences of opinion and philosophy.
But if you are asking me if the tension exists today that existed when the Berlin Wall went up, the answer is no.
Now, we can understand the Soviet Union's inhibitions and the problems they have as long as Vietnam is taking place.
They are called upon to support their Communist brother, and they are supporting him in a limited way with some equipment.
We wish that were not so.
We would hope that they would exercise their duties and their responsibilities as cochairmen and take some leadership and try to bring this war to an end.
But we do not think that things are as tense, or as serious, or as dangerous as they were when the Berlin Wall went up, in the Cuban missile crisis, or following  Kennedy's visit with  Khrushchev at Vienna.
I do not find that complaint in Europe.
I find it in Georgetown among a few columnists generally.
The European leaderswe are having very frequent exchanges with them generally.
Prime Minister Wilson will be here early in February.
He has been here several times.
We have been to Germany, and  Kiesinger and ahead of him  Erhard, and ahead of him  Adenauer have been here.
Many of the Scandinavian leaders have come here.
The Dutch leaders have come here.
This year in Europe we have had a very long agenda that has produced what we think are very excellent results.
We have just concluded an agreement on the Kennedy Round, which involved very far-reaching trade concessions.
We think it will stand as a monument to the relationship of the people of Europe and the people of the United States, and very much to both of their advantages.
We had a challenge of NATO and General de Gaulle asked us to get out of France.
We sat down with the other 14 members of NATO, the other European nations, and we looked at our problem.
We decided that we would go to Belgium.
Thirteen of those nations joined the United States and 14 of us went there.
NATO is now intact, as solid as it can be, unified.
Secretary Rusk has just returned from very successful meetings with them.
So the challenge to NATO has been rebuffed.
The difficulties of the Kennedy Round have been solved.
The frequent predictions that the Germans would reduce their troop strength 60,000 and we would bring our divisions back from Europethose matters have been worked out.
We are working feverishly every day trying to bring about a nonproliferation agreement and we are making headway.
So I think, if you take the results of this year's efforts in Europe, that most European statesmen who have been engaged in those efforts would think we have been quite successful and probably more successful than any other period.
And I do not see that we have either ignored them or neglected them.
I would say that not all of it is changing.
I would say that all through our history, as these changes occurred, there has been violence connected with them.
We found that true in World War I.
We found that true in World War II We had a riot in Detroit during President Roosevelt's administration where he had to send out troops that compared very much to the same one we had there this year.
We have this unrest.
We have this uncertainty.
We have this desire of people who have been held down all these years to rise up and try to acquire, quickly, what has been denied them so unjustly so long.
We have more violence than we want, and more than we should have, more than we are going to be able to tolerate.
But I do not think that represents all the country at all.
I think that represents a very small minority.
I think our big problem is to get at the causes of these riots.
I think that some of the causes are the hope of the people themselves.
They do not have jobs.
They want jobs.
So we are going to have to provide jobs.
There are some half-million unemployed, hard-core unemployed, in our principal cities.
We just have to go and find jobs for them.
I am going to call in the businessmen of America and say one of two things has to happen: You have to help me go out here and find jobs for these people, or we are going to have to find jobs in the Government for them and offer every one of them a job.
I think that is one thing that could be done.
I think that will have to be done, as expensive as it is.
Second, I think we will have to do something about the housing situation.
People live in filth, in dilapidated houses.
More new housing ought to be built and has to be built.
We have to find places to build that housing.
I have tried to pass legislation that I thought would be helpful, such as the open housing bill.
I have tried to encourage the Congress to take action on model cities and on rent supplements.
We have made progress, although not as much as we would like.
So, we are going to have to accelerate and step up rebuilding our cities so we can have decent housing.
In the field of education, education has been denied to the poor on an equal basis for many years.
The poor children have not had the advantages because of lack of transportation, because of the economic situation in their family, because of a lot of reasons-their own health conditions.
So, they have not had the education.
And because of discrimination, they have not had the educational opportunities that the other children have had.
So we are fast correcting those.
We have tripled our education program in 3 years, and the poor have been the primary beneficiaries.
We are spending three times as much on health today as we were 4 years ago, and the poor are the primary beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid.
They can have their hospital bills paid now.
They can have their doctors paid now.
As a result, our infant mortality rate is going down.
As a result, our death rate is going down.
We have made great progress with health and education.
They are important things.
So I would say jobs, health, education, and housing are all contributing to this general dissatisfaction that results in violence on occasions, and we have to accelerate our efforts there.
We have to appeal to these people to keep their feelings within bounds and keep them lawful, because every person in this country must obey the law of this country, and there is no situation that justifies your violating the law.
I told you the reasons why: because revolting and violence are unlawful.
It is not going to be allowed.
It does not solve the problem.
It is not the answer to the conditions that exist.
The answer is jobs.
The answer is education.
The answer is health.
Now, if we refuse to give those answers, people are going to lose hope, and when they do, it is pretty difficult to get them to be as reasonable as we think they should be.
But there is every reason why they should not.
Violence is not going to produce more jobs.
Violence is not going to produce more education.
Violating the law and taking the law into your own hands is not going to produce better health or better housing.
It is going to produce anarchy.
And that cannot be tolerated.
I do not agree with the extremists and I hope you do not.
I have outlined that: jobs, housing, education, healthall of these things, trying to get at these problems.
We think that if we can have a program for the cities, like model cities, we think if we can have jobs, like neighborhood youth training and the job program we are working out, if we can find employment for all the hard corewe think that this will answer some of the causes of the riots.
You know what my reaction to it is.
What is your answer to it, Frank? What is your answer, though, Frank? If not, what? What is your solution? What do you recommend? You are not going to answer it now? You are not going to give us your recommendations or your thoughts? That is what we are doing.
We accept your recommendation and we will carry it out.
We hope that the Congress will, as these things develop, see the need of them.
We think we have made progress.
We could not get the model cities program authorized and funded 2 years ago, but we did this year.
We could not get rent supplements authorized and funded, but we have this year.
We could not get the housing programs that we have underway now authorized and funded 2 years ago, but we have this year.
We are making progress.
We cannot correct it overnight.
You cannot take the errors of 100 years and solve them in 100 days.
We would like to do as much as we can.
I am recommending a good deal more than the Congress is willing to do.
In the poverty field I recommended and urged, and asked every Cabinet member to join us in doing sowe urged the Congress to provide $2.
2 billion in funds for poverty.
They cut it several hundred million dollars.
We have made recommendations for 40,000 rent supplement units, $40 million.
They cut it to $10 million.
I regret it.
If I could issue an Executive order and vitiate it, and put nay own program into effect, I would do it.
But we are moving in that direction.
And we are going to do all we can to accelerate it and to escalate it.
Yes, I sense it.
I think we have that condition.
And we are trying to meet it as best we know how.
I have seen it several times in my lifetime.
I remember the days of the zoot-suiters in World War II I remember the doubters who thought all of our youth were going to the dogs because of the sit-down movements in some of the plants in our country at certain periods of our country.
I remember the doubt expressed about our ability in World War II to take a bunch of beardless boys and resist Hitler's legions.
There have been some disappointments.
But I have visited the campuses of this country.
My Cabinet has gone and met with the young people of this country.
We deal with young folks every day in the Peace Corps, in the poverty program, in the VISTA program, and in the job camps.
And I think it is a very small percentage that have given up, who have lost faith, who have deep questions about the future of the country and of themselves.
We have more than 3 million young people serving in uniform.
I hear from about 100 of them every day.
They do not get the attention that you television people give these exhibitionists.
They do not have anyone to make signs for them and parade, get their pictures in the papers.
They are just there from daylight to dark, fighting for freedom and liberty, and willing to die for it.
They are a pretty large number, comparatively speaking.
I doubt that there is anything like that many hippies, or I doubt that there are that many disillusioned people.
If you added them all up and put them in one unit, I think that they would make a very small percentage.
And I think anyone who thinks the youth of the country is going to the dogs, or implies it, better take another look at it.
I have just gone through two weddings this year, and I have been associated with a lot of young people.
And the kind of young people I see, whom I hear, who write me, are not the little group that you all can ferret out up here at some park or some placethat have nothing to do but carry a sign around on their shoulders and try to obstruct someone else from getting to a place or try to howl them down after they get there.
I think we have young people who are terribly upset at what is going on.
I know they hate war.
We all hate war.
But I think there is a very small percent who are going to take these extreme means and going to employ these extreme ways to express this lack of confidence in their future and in their country.
Yes, and do.
Yes.
I think there has been a very subtle effort made by a few politicians to suggest that it would be difficult for the President to travel; it would be very dangerous.
Probably the wish was father to the thought.
I think there has been some indication that certain organized groups would try to bring embarrassment to the Secretary of State by not letting him talk, or to the Vice President by interrupting his talk.
But every time that has happenedand it has been encouraged some by some of the political groups, because we have followed them and have seen that that has happened-the people have been resounding in their disapproval.
While we all recognize dissent, and we expect it, and we treat it respectfully, we listen to it, we do not think that dissent should be turned into hooliganism, and we do not think because a person has a right to dissent thatas a great Justice one time said-you have a right to holier fire in a crowded theater, or that you have the right to tear a speaker's necktie off, or to put your hand over his mouth and prevent him from speaking.
We think the dissent should be within the law, and within the Constitution.
We respect it when it is.
But if they are going to use storm trooper tactics, it will be dealt with and will be dealt with properly.
If they are going to encourage folks to bring bodily harm to a President, or to any other official, that is sinking very low, and we do not think the people want to hear much like that, either over the television in the form of suggestion, or by some who are sent to these campuses to incite folks.
You see them on every campus, on your television every night.
They are representatives of various groups.
I do not want to get personal and I do not want to give them advertisement, but if you are interested just turn on ABC tonight and look at the newscast.
A good part of every newscast you have will have some of these folks who are encouraging the dissent, appealing to them.
They will be parading.
They will have their signs.
They will be charging us with murder, and this and that, because we are trying to carry out our obligations and our treaty commitments and protect that flag.
No, I did not say that.
I said they report it.
And if you want to see it, it is there for you to see it.
I did not say anything about disproportionate.
Well, I think that is a matter for your judgment.
I do not think it is up to the President to be making up your newscasts.
Well, in the first place, I am not in the business of recommending their program for them.
I have enough problems with my own program.
But we do have a way of people in this country expressing their viewpoint, giving out interviews, making speeches, having picketing.
I would say generally speaking,  Rather, being lawful, abiding by the law of the land, doing whatever the law will permit them to do.
I do not think you have to be a law violator in the name of the first amendment.
I do not think you are justified in being a law violator in order to have your right of free speech.
I think that the people who ought to want to follow the law and the Constitution the most are the dissenters themselves, because it is that law and that Constitution which gives them their right to dissent and protects that right.
I am amazed that some of these so-called liberal folks who reserve for themselves the right to speak long, loud, and freely, but when the opposition views are expressed, they try to drown it out with catcalls, eggs, or tomatoes.
I do not understand that kind of behavior.
I am not familiar with that.
Who says that? I do not think that is correct at all.
We read the papers, we see the television, we read our correspondence.
We spend a good deal more time on that than we do out viewing what he is saying or doing at the Pentagon.
I have not done that, Ray.
I think in due time I will cross that bridge.
Until then, I do not want to speculate about it.
Until I do that, I am not going to speculate about it.
Well, I will do that when I leave it.
I just do not know.
I do not know what the effect of the Kennedy-McCarthy movement is having in the country.
I am not a reporter.
I have not followed it.
I am not privileged to all the conversations that may have taken place.
I just observe they have had some meetings and some discussions.
I do know of the interest of both of them in the Presidency and the ambition of both of them.
I see that reflected from time to time.
But just what they are prepared to do, how they are going to do it, whether they are going to do it in concert, or what will be the effect upon the American people of these maneuvering, I am not prepared to say.
I believe that the French people have an understanding, an interest, and affection for the American people, and I think it is greatly reciprocated.
I am sorry that the relationship between the President and  de Gaulle is not a closer one and that we do not see matters alike any more often than we do.
We have tried to do everything that we know to do to minimize the differences that exist in the leadership of the two governments.
We strongly feel that the people of the two countries have a long history of friendship and we are determined to preserve that.
We are also determined to minimize our differences and, from my part, to do nothing to unjustly or unduly provoke the French Government.
I got precisely to the point.
I do not want to do anything to accentuate, aggravate, or contribute to emphasizing the differences that we have and straining the relations.
I think basically our people are friendly and I am going to do all I can to keep them friendly.
I think you must have the trust of the people.
I feel we do have the trust of the people.
I do think we have the support of the people.
The people in every election have had a chance to express themselves, in a national election, and have given us a majority vote.
In 1964, the last election, we got 61 percent of the votes, the highest percentage any President ever obtained.
I am not talking about some individual poll.
In the last congressional election, we had a majority in both House and Senate.
Now we lost some of our majority.
We lost some of our support.
I do not think there is any question about that.
In a preelection year you will always do that.
We looked ahead of 1964 when they were having the San Francisco convention.
I think a great many people toyed with the idea of joining or voting in the opposition party until they had the results of the convention, until they saw what would happen if you elected a Republican, and who would be brought into office, the kind of government you would have, and the kind of policies you would have.
I think there is some uncertainty in the country.
I think there is some division in the country.
I do not think that the opposition is in the majority and I do not think they will be on election day.
But I do not discount it, and I do not ignore it.
I would hope that it would be a more knowledgeable world and a better educated world.
There are four people out of every 10 today who cannot read cat, who cannot spell dog, who cannot recognize the printed word mother.
I would like to see every boy and girl who is born in the world have all the education that he or she can take.
We are making great gains in that direction in this country.
I would like to see other nations make great gains.
I would like to see an enlightened program of family planning available to all the peoples of the world.
I would like to see the problem of food production faced up to and nations take the necessary steps to try to provide the food that they are going to need to support their populations.
I would like to see the miracles of health extended to all the peoples of the world as they were to the fellow who was operated on with the heart change the other day.
I know that the infant mortality rate is going down.
I should like to see it reflected in all the 110 nations.
In short, I believe that our ancient enemies are ignorance and illiteracy, are disease and bigotry.
I would like to see my descendants grow up in a world that is as educated as possible, as healthy as science will permit, as prepared to feed itself, and which certainly has sufficient conservation forces to permit enjoyable leisure for the people who work long and late.
And I think we are moving to that end.
It is very hard to predict what is ahead.
The Secretary of the Treasury and the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Budget Director have made the best statements that they could to the Ways and Means Committee.
We think the business activity is going to pick up.
We think there is going to be increased production.
We think it is very essential that we have a tax bill.
We look forward to continued prosperity.
We have had 82 months of unparalleled prosperity in this country, longer than any other period, uninterrupted, and we want to keep things that way.
We think the most important thing to us, from a domestic standpoint, is to provide more jobs, and we have added six million jobs in the last few years.
We think that those jobs ought to have good pay, but that we should not increase our wages or our profits or our dividends, beyond what the increased productivity justifies, so that we can maintain some restraint on prices.
And while we are not satisfied with the job we have done, we have done a better job than any other country and we are urging both business and labor to take that into consideration in their negotiations with each other.
I have said to them in several public statements that we hope that they can conduct themselves in such a way as will permit them to join the family of nations and that we can learn to live in harmony with each other.
We have no desire to be enemies of any nation in the world.
We believe that it is possible, over the years, for them to develop a better understanding of the world in which they live.
We think there are some very important things taking place right in China today that will contribute to, we hope, a better understanding and a more moderate approach to their neighbors in the world.
We have observed their failures in Africa, and in Latin America, and in Southeast Asia, where they have undertaken aggressive steps that have resulted in failure for them.
And we hope they will profit by these experiences.
We believe they will.
We do not know all that we would like to know about what is going on in China.
It is a rather closed society and we do not have all the information that we would like to have.
But we are hopeful and we believe that over a period of time, that the opportunity exists for them to gain a better understanding of the other peoples of the world and thus be able to live more harmoniously with them.
No.
I can only repeat what Secretary McNamara said and what I have said.
Secretary McNamara has been Secretary of Defense longer than any other man.
I think he has been the best Secretary of Defense that we have ever had.
I hate to see him leave as Secretary of Defense.
I take great satisfaction in the contribution that  McNamara has made to the Government.
He is only on sabbatical leave.
He is not going to be very far away from here.
And on anything that is remotely connected with the best interests of the world, that the World Bank is interested in, we will be working very close together.
I do not consider that I have lost his services, or the world has lost his talents, or that I have lost a friend in any way.
I think that instead of building a great machine at the Pentagon for the purpose of defending liberty and freedom, that he will be busy at the World Bank in the constructive purpose of building the economies and bettering humanity in these very nations that we are trying to defend.
And I took forward with a great deal of pleasure to working very closely with him.
We will have detailed recommendations in our State of the Union in connection with the problems the Nation faces.
There are many unresolved problems.
There will be substantial recommendations to the next Congress.
There have been substantial achievements in this one.
We did not get everything we wanted at all.
We never have.
But we had a good Congress.
We did not have as good a Congress as we had in the 89th Congress.
We did not pass as many substantive measures and they did not reach as far as the others.
They were curtailed some because that was the mood of the Congress.
And on a good many measures they were able to reduce our proposals.
They did not destroy model cities.
They crippled it.
They cut it by several hundred million.
They did not destroy rent supplements, but they cut it from $40 million to $10 million.
They did not destroy the rat bill.
They knocked it out for a while and staggered it, but after the Senate worked on it, we approved it.
They did not recommit a good many of the bills, but they reduced them.
They did not wipe out poverty, but they reduced it from $2.
2 billionseveral hundred million to $1.
7 billion something.
So those are the things that you have to face up to.
I am not saying ugly things about the individuals.
Those men think they are right.
They do not want to take some of these new programs.
They do not want to fund model cities, rent supplements, or face up to the urban requirements and what I think are 20th century requirements.
And I understand their philosophy.
I have understood it for 35 years.
They frequently are the preservers of stagnation.
And they want to keep things as they are.
They do not want to move forward.
Now, I came into the executive branch with a man who said, Let's get the country moving again.
Now we have the country moving again and we want to keep it moving.
We are going to keep it moving if we can get the Congress support.
And while we did not get them to support us every time we wanted to, we did move forward and we hope the next session will be a productive one, too.
I am going to appeal to every Republican in an election year to come in and do what is best for his country.
And if he does that, without regard to how it might cripple the President, without regard to the politics of the year, then I think we will have a good Congress.
I am going to do what I think is best for my country, at home and abroad, without regard to what effect it has on my future.
And if they will do the same thing, we will have a good government, a good country, and then we can let the election take care of itself.
And I think we will have a good election.
Thank you,  President.
Speaker,  President, Members of the Congress, and my fellow Americans: I was thinking as I was walking down the aisle tonight of what Sam Rayburn told me many years ago: The Congress always extends a very warm welcome to the President-as he comes in.
Thank all of you very, very much.
I have come once again to this Chamber-the home of our democracyto give you, as the Constitution requires, Information of the State of the UnionI report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad:that it is our will that is being tried, not our strength; our sense of purpose, not our ability to achieve a better America;that we have the strength to meet our every challenge; the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home; and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world.
And I report to you that I believe, with abiding conviction, that this peoplenurtured by their deep faith, tutored by their hard lessons, moved by their high aspirations-have the will to meet the trials that these times impose.
Since I reported to you last January:Three elections have been held in Vietnamin the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence.
A President, a Vice President, a House and Senate, and village officials have been chosen by popular, contested ballot.
The enemy has been defeated in battle after battle.
The number of South Vietnamese living in areas under Government protection tonight has grown by more than a million since January of last year.
These are all marks of progress.
Yet:The enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into battle, despite his continuous heavy losses.
He continues to hope that America's will to persevere can be broken.
Wellhe is wrong.
America will persevere.
Our patience and our perseverance will match our power.
Aggression will never prevail.
But our goal is peaceand peace at the earliest possible moment.
Right now we are exploring the meaning of Hanoi's recent statement.
There is no mystery about the questions which must be answered before the bombing is stopped.
We believe that any talks should follow the San Antonio formula that I stated last September, which said:The bombing would stop immediately if talks would take place promptly and with reasonable hopes that they would be productive.
And the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past.
This Nation simply cannot accept anything less without jeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies.
If a basis for peace talks can be established on the San Antonio foundationsand it is my hope and my prayer that they canwe would consult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostilitiesa really true cease-firecould be made the first order of business.
I will report at the earliest possible moment the results of these explorations to the American people.
I have just recently returned from a very fruitful visit and talks with His Holiness the Pope and I share his hopeas he expressed it earlier todaythat both sides will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end to the war in Vietnam.
I have today assured him that we and our allies will do our full part to bring this about.
Since I spoke to you last January, other events have occurred that have major consequences for world peace.
The Kennedy Round achieved the greatest reduction in tariff barriers in all the history of trade negotiations.
The nations of Latin America at Punta del Este resolved to move toward economic integration.
In Asia, the nations from Korea and Japan to Indonesia and Singapore worked behind America's shield to strengthen their economies and to broaden their political cooperation.
In Africa, from which the distinguished Vice President has just returned, he reports to me that there is a spirit of regional cooperation that is beginning to take hold in very practical ways.
These events we all welcomed.
Yet since I last reported to you, we and the world have been confronted by a number of crises:During the Arab-Israeli war last June, the hot line between Washington and Moscow was used for the first time in our history.
A cease-fire was achieved without a major power confrontation.
Now the nations of the Middle East have the opportunity to cooperate with Ambassador Jarring's U.
N.
mission and they have the responsibility to find the terms of living together in stable peace and dignity, and we shall do all in our power to help them achieve that result.
Not far from this scene of conflict, a crisis flared on Cyprus involving two peoples who are America's friends: Greece and Turkey.
Our very able representative,  Cyrus Vance, and others helped to ease this tension.
Turmoil continues on the mainland of China after a year of violent disruption.
The radical extremism of their Government has isolated the Chinese people behind their own borders.
The United States, however, remains willing to permit the travel of journalists to both our countries; to undertake cultural and educational exchanges; and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop materials.
Since I spoke to you last, the United States and the Soviet Union have taken several important steps toward the goal of international cooperation.
As you will remember, I met with Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro and we achieved if not accord, at least a clearer understanding of our respective positions after 2 days of meeting.
Because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrowed, we have worked with the Soviet Union and with other nations to reach an agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapons.
On the basis of communications from Ambassador Fisher in Geneva this afternoon, I am encouraged to believe that a draft treaty can be laid before the conference in Geneva in the very near future.
I hope to be able to present that treaty to the Senate this year for the Senate's approval.
We achieved, in 1967, a consular treaty with the Soviets, the first commercial air agreement between the two countries, and a treaty banning weapons in outer space.
We shall sign, and submit to the Senate shortly, a new treaty with the Soviets and with others for the protection of astronauts.
Serious differences still remain between us, yet in these relations, we have made some progress since Vienna, the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban missile crisis.
But despite this progress, we must maintain a military force that is capable of deterring any threat to this Nation's security, whatever the mode of aggression.
Our choices must not be confined to total war-or to total acquiescence.
We have such a military force today.
We shall maintain it.
I wishwith all of my heartthat the expenditures that are necessary to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs of peace.
But until world conditions permit, and until peace is assured, America's mightand America's bravest sons who wear our Nation's uniformmust continue to stand guard for all of usas they gallantly do tonight in Vietnam and other places in the world.
Yet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the conditions of peace.
For two decades America has committed itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threatens the peace.
We shall sustain that commitment.
This year I shall propose:That we launch, with other nations, an exploration of the ocean depths to tap its wealth, and its energy, and its abundance.
That we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the International Development Association, and to increase the resources of the Asian Development Bank.
That we adopt a prudent aid program, rooted in the principle of self-help.
That we renew and extend the food for freedom program.
Our food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of famine.
But unless the rapid growth of population in developing countries is slowed, the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily.
Governments in the developing countries must take such facts into consideration.
We in the United States are prepared to help assist them in those efforts.
But we must also improve the lives of children already born in the villages and towns and cities on this earth.
They can be taught by great teachers through space communications and the miracle of satellite television-and we are going to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true.
Let me speak now about some matters here at home.
Tonight our Nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever been accomplished before.
Americans are prosperous as men have never been in recorded history.
Yet there is in the land a certain restlessnessa questioning.
The total of our Nation's annual production is now above $800 billion.
For 83 months this Nation has been on a steady upward trend of growth.
All about them, most American families can see the evidence of growing abundance: higher paychecks, humming factories, new cars moving down new highways.
More and more families own their own homes, equipped with more than 70 million television sets.
A new college is founded every week.
Today more than half of the high school graduates go on to college.
There are hundreds of thousands of fathers and mothers who never completed grammar schoolwho will see their children graduate from college.
Why, then, this restlessness?Because when a great ship cuts through the sea, the waters are always stirred and troubled.
And our ship is moving.
It is moving through troubled and new waters; it is moving toward new and better shores.
We ask now, not how can we achieve abundance?but how shall we use our abundance? Not, is there abundance enough for all?but, how can all share in our abundance?While we have accomplished much, much remains for us to meet and much remains for us to master.
In some areas, the jobless rate is still three or four times the national average.
Violence has shown its face in some of our cities.
Crime increases on our streets.
Income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers; and parity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hopenot an achievement.
New housing construction is far less than we needto assure decent shelter for every family.
Hospital and medical costs are high, and they are rising.
Many riversand the air in many citiesremain badly polluted.
And our citizens suffer from breathing that air.
We have lived with conditions like these for many, many years.
But much that we once accepted as inevitable, we now find absolutely intolerable.
In our cities last summer, we saw how wide is the gulf for some Americans between the promise and the reality of our society.
We know that we cannot change all of this in a day.
It represents the bitter consequences of more than three centuries.
But the issue is not whether we can change this; the issue is whether we will change this.
Well, I know we can.
And I believe we will.
This then is the work we should do in the months that are ahead of us in this Congress.
The first essential is more jobs, useful jobs for tens of thousands who can become productive and can pay their own way.
Our economy has created 7 1/2 million new jobs in the past 4 years.
It is adding more than a million and a half new jobs this year.
Through programs passed by the Congress, job training is being given tonight to more than a million Americans in this country.
This year, the time has come when we must get to those who are last in linethe hard-core unemployedthe hardest to reach.
Employment officials estimate that 500,000 of these persons are now unemployed in the major cities of America.
Our objective is to place these 500,000 in private industry jobs within the next 3 years.
To do this, I propose a $2.
1 billion manpower program in the coming fiscal year-a 25 percent increase over the current year.
Most of this increase will be used to start a new partnership between government and private industry to train and to hire the hard-core unemployed persons.
I know of no task before us of more importance to us, to the country, or to our future.
Another essential is to rebuild our cities.
Last year the Congress authorized $662 million for the Model Cities program.
I requested the full amount of that authorization to help meet the crisis in the cities of America.
But the Congress appropriated only $312 millionless than half.
This year I urge the Congress to honor my request for model cities funds to rebuild the centers of American cities by granting us the full amount that you in the Congress authorized$1 billion.
The next essential is more housingand more housing now.
Surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the reach of its families.
Therefore we must call together the resources of industry and labor, to start building 300,000 housing units for low- and middle-income families next yearthat is three times more than this year.
We must make it possible for thousands of families to become homeowners, not rent-payers.
I propose, for the consideration of this Congress, a 10-year campaign to build 6 million new housing units for low and middle-income families.
Six million units in the next 10 years.
We have built 530,000 the last 10 years.
Better health for our childrenall of our childrenis essential if we are to have a better America.
Last year, Medicare, Medicaid, and other new programs that you passed in the Congress brought better health to more than 25 million Americans.
American medicinewith the very strong support and cooperation of public resources-has produced a phenomenal decline in the death rate from many of the dread diseases.
But it is a shocking fact that, in saving the lives of babies, America ranks 15th among the nations of the world.
And among children, crippling defects are often discovered too late for any corrective action.
This is a tragedy that Americans can, and Americans should, prevent.
I shall, therefore, propose to the Congress a child health program to provide, over the next 5 years, for families unable to afford itaccess to health services from prenatal care of the mother through the child's first year.
When we do that you will find it is the best investment we ever made because we will get these diseases in their infancy and we will find a cure in a great many instances that we can never find by overcrowding our hospitals when they are grown.
Now when we act to advance the consumer's cause I think we help every American.
Last year, with very little fanfare the Congress and the executive branch moved in that field.
We enacted the Wholesome Meat Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Product Safety Commission, and a law to improve clinical laboratories.
And now, I think, the time has come to complete our unfinished work.
The Senate has already passed the truth-in-lending bill, the fire safety bill, and the pipeline safety laws.
Tonight I plead with the House to immediately act upon these measures and I hope take favorable action upon all of them.
I call upon the Congress to enact, without delay, the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection laws that I submitted to the Congress last year.
I also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the House to guard against fraud and manipulation in the Nation's commodity exchange market.
These measures are a pledge to our people-to keep them safe in their homes and at work, and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace.
And I think we must do more.
I propose:New powers for the Federal Trade Commission to stop those who defraud and who swindle our public.
New safeguards to insure the quality of fish and poultry, and the safety of our community water supplies.
A major study of automobile insurance.
Protection against hazardous radiation from television sets and other electronic equipment.
And to give the consumer a stronger voice, I plan to appoint a consumer counsel in the Justice Departmenta lawyer for the American consumerto work directly under the Attorney General, to serve the President's Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs, and to serve the consumers of this land.
This CongressDemocrats and Republicanscan earn the thanks of history.
We can make this truly a new day for the American consumer, and by giving him this protection we can live in history as the consumer-conscious Congress.
So let us get on with the work.
Let us act soon.
We, at every level of the government, State, local, Federal, know that the American people have had enough of rising crime and lawlessness in this country.
They recognize that law enforcement is first the duty of local police and local government.
They recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime is in the home, the church, the city hall and the county courthouse and the statehousenot in the far-removed National Capital of Washington.
But the people also recognize that the National Government can and the National Government should help the cities and the States in their war on crime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional authority.
And this we shall do.
This does not mean a national police force.
It does mean help and financial support:to develop State and local master plans to combat crime,to provide better training and better pay for police, andto bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city and every county in America.
There is no more urgent business before this Congress than to pass the Safe Streets Act this year that I proposed last year.
That law will provide these required funds.
They are so critically needed that I have doubled my request under this act to $100 million in fiscal 1969.
And I urge the Congress to stop the trade in mail-order murder, to stop it this year by adopting a proper gun control law.
This year, I will propose a Drug Control Act to provide stricter penalties for those who traffic in LSD and other dangerous drugs with our people.
I will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug laws by increasing the number of Federal drug and narcotics control officials by more than 30 percent.
The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young.
I also request you to give us funds to add immediately 100 assistant United States attorneys throughout the land to help prosecute our criminal laws.
We have increased our judiciary by 40 percent and we have increased our prosecutors by 16 percent.
The dockets are full of cases because we do not have assistant district attorneys to go before the Federal judge and handle them.
We start these young lawyers at $8,200 a year.
And the docket is clogged because we do not have authority to hire more of them.
I ask the Congress for authority to hire 100 more.
These young men will give special attention to this drug abuse, too.
Finally, I ask you to add 100 FBI agents to strengthen law enforcement in the Nation and to protect the individual rights of every citizen.
A moment ago I spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where the fires of disorder burned last summer.
We can-and in time we willchange that despair into confidence, and change those frustrations into achievements.
But violence will never bring progress.
We can make progress only by attacking the causes of violence and only where there is civil order founded on justice.
Today we are helping local officials improve their capacity to deal promptly with disorders.
Those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that local authorities are able to resist them swiftly, to resist them sternly, and to resist them decisively.
I shall recommend other actions:To raise the farmers' income by establishing a security commodity reserve that will protect the market from price-depressing stocks and protect the consumer from food scarcity.
I shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively for fair prices.
I shall recommend programs for new air safety measures.
Measures to stem the rising costs of medical care.
Legislation to encourage our returning veterans to devote themselves to careers in community service such as teaching, and being firemen, and joining our police force, and our law enforcement officials.
I shall recommend programs to strengthen and finance our anti-pollution efforts.
Fully funding all of the $2.
18 billion poverty program that you in the Congress had just authorized in order to bring opportunity to those who have been left far behind.
I shall recommend an Educational Opportunity Act to speed up our drive to break down the financial barriers that are separating our young people from college.
I shall also urge the Congress to act on several other vital pending billsespecially the civil rights measuresfair jury trials, protection of Federal rights, enforcement of equal employment opportunity, and fair housing.
The unfinished work of the first session must be completedthe Higher Education Act, the Juvenile Delinquency Act, conservation measures to save the redwoods of California, and to preserve the wonders of our scenic rivers, the Highway Beautification Actand all the other measures for a cleaner, and for a better, and for a more beautiful America.
Next month we will begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity.
The economic outlook for this year is one of steady growth-if we are vigilant.
True, there are some clouds on the horizon.
Prices are rising.
Interest rates have passed the peak of 1966; and if there is continued inaction on the tax bill, they will climb even higher.
I warn the Congress and the Nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep us into an accelerating spiral of price increases, a slump in homebuilding, and a continuing erosion of the American dollar.
This would be a tragedy for every American family.
And I predict that if this happens, they will all let us know about it.
Wethose of us in the executive branch, in the Congress, and the leaders of labor and businessmust do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune.
Under the new budget, the expenditures for 1969 will increase by $10.
4 billion.
Receipts will increase by $22.
3 billion including the added tax revenues.
Virtually all of this expenditure increase represents the mandatory cost of our defense efforts, $3 billion; increased interest, almost $1 billion; or mandatory payments under laws passed by Congresssuch as those provided in the Social Security Act that you passed in 1967, and to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, veterans, and farmers, of about $4 1/2 billion; and the additional $1 billion 600 million next year for the pay increases that you passed in military and civilian pay.
That makes up the $10 billion that is added to the budget.
With few exceptions, very few, we are holding the fiscal 1969 budget to last year's level, outside of those mandatory and required increases.
A Presidential commission composed of distinguished congressional fiscal leaders and other prominent Americans recommended this year that we adopt a new budget approach.
I am carrying out their recommendations in this year's budget.
This budget, therefore, for the first time accurately covers all Federal expenditures and all Federal receipts, including for the first time in one budget $47 billion from the social security, Medicare, highway, and other trust funds.
The fiscal 1969 budget has expenditures of approximately $186 billion, with total estimated revenues, including the tax bill, of about $178 billion.
If the Congress enacts the tax increase, we will reduce the budget deficit by some $12 billion.
The war in Vietnam is costing us about $25 billion and we are asking for about $12 billion in taxesand if we get that $12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $20 billion in 1968 to about $8 billion in 1969.
Now, this is a tight budget.
It follows the reduction that I made in cooperation with the Congressa reduction made after you had reviewed every appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $5 or $6 billion and expenditures by $1.
5 billion.
We conferred together and I recommended to the Congress and you subsequently approved taking 2 percent from payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures.
We therefore reduced appropriations almost $10 billion last session and expenditures over $4 billion.
Now, that was in the budget last year.
I ask the Congress to recognize that there are certain selected programs that meet the Nation's most urgent needs and they have increased.
We have insisted that decreases in very desirable but less urgent programs be made before we would approve any increases.
So I ask the Congress tonight:to hold its appropriations to the budget requests, andto act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which for the average American individual amounts to about a penny out of each dollar's income.
This tax increase would yield about half of the $23 billion per year that we returned to the people in the tax reduction bills of 1964 and 1965.
This must be a temporary measure, which expires in less than 2 years.
Congress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed.
But Congress can never repeal inflation.
The leaders of American business and the leaders of American laborthose who really have power over wages and pricesmust act responsibly, and in their Nation's interest by keeping increases in line with productivity.
If our recognized leaders do not do this, they and those for whom they speak and all of us are going to suffer very serious consequences.
On January 1st, I outlined a program to reduce our balance of payments deficit sharply this year.
We will ask the Congress to help carry out those parts of the program which require legislation.
We must restore equilibrium to our balance of payments.
We must also strengthen the international monetary system.
We have assured the world that America's full gold stock stands behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at $35 an ounce.
We must back this commitment by legislating now to free our gold reserves.
Americans, traveling more than any other people in history, took $4 billion out of their country last year in travel costs.
We must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $2 billion.
We are hoping that we can reduce it by $500 millionwithout unduly penalizing the travel of teachers, students, business people who have essential and necessary travel, or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to see.
Even with this reduction of $500 million, the American people will still be traveling more overseas than they did in 1967, 1966, or 1965 or any other year in their history.
If we act together as I hope we can, I believe we can continue our economic expansion which has already broken all past records.
And I hope that we can continue that expansion in the days ahead.
Each of these questions I have discussed with you tonight is a question of policy for our people.
Therefore, each of them should beand doubtless will bedebated by candidates for public office this year.
I hope those debates will be marked by new proposals and by a seriousness that matches the gravity of the questions themselves.
These are not appropriate subjects for narrow partisan oratory.
They go to the heart of what we Americans are all aboutall of us, Democrats and Republicans.
Tonight I have spoken of some of the goals I should like to see America reach.
Many of them can be achieved this year-others by the time we celebrate our Nation's 200th birthdaythe bicentennial of our independence.
Several of these goals are going to be very hard to reach.
But the State of our Union will be much stronger 8 years from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach these goals now.
They are more important-much more importantthan the identity of the party or the President who will then be in office.
These goals are what the fighting and our alliances are really meant to protect.
Can we achieve these goals?Of course we canif we will.
If ever there was a people who sought more than mere abundance, it is our people.
If ever there was a nation that was capable of solving its problems, it is this Nation.
If ever there were a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of being an Americanit is this time.
So this, my friends, is the State of our Union: seeking, building, tested many times in this past yearand always equal to the test.
Thank you and good night.
Speaker,  President, Members of the Congress, and my fellow Americans: I was thinking as I was walking down the aisle tonight of what Sam Rayburn told me many years ago: The Congress always extends a very warm welcome to the President-as he comes in.
Thank all of you very, very much.
I have come once again to this Chamber-the home of our democracyto give you, as the Constitution requires, Information of the State of the UnionI report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad:that it is our will that is being tried, not our strength; our sense of purpose, not our ability to achieve a better America;that we have the strength to meet our every challenge; the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home; and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world.
And I report to you that I believe, with abiding conviction, that this peoplenurtured by their deep faith, tutored by their hard lessons, moved by their high aspirations-have the will to meet the trials that these times impose.
Since I reported to you last January:Three elections have been held in Vietnamin the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence.
A President, a Vice President, a House and Senate, and village officials have been chosen by popular, contested ballot.
The enemy has been defeated in battle after battle.
The number of South Vietnamese living in areas under Government protection tonight has grown by more than a million since January of last year.
These are all marks of progress.
Yet:The enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into battle, despite his continuous heavy losses.
He continues to hope that America's will to persevere can be broken.
Wellhe is wrong.
America will persevere.
Our patience and our perseverance will match our power.
Aggression will never prevail.
But our goal is peaceand peace at the earliest possible moment.
Right now we are exploring the meaning of Hanoi's recent statement.
There is no mystery about the questions which must be answered before the bombing is stopped.
We believe that any talks should follow the San Antonio formula that I stated last September, which said:The bombing would stop immediately if talks would take place promptly and with reasonable hopes that they would be productive.
And the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past.
This Nation simply cannot accept anything less without jeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies.
If a basis for peace talks can be established on the San Antonio foundationsand it is my hope and my prayer that they canwe would consult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostilitiesa really true cease-firecould be made the first order of business.
I will report at the earliest possible moment the results of these explorations to the American people.
I have just recently returned from a very fruitful visit and talks with His Holiness the Pope and I share his hopeas he expressed it earlier todaythat both sides will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end to the war in Vietnam.
I have today assured him that we and our allies will do our full part to bring this about.
Since I spoke to you last January, other events have occurred that have major consequences for world peace.
The Kennedy Round achieved the greatest reduction in tariff barriers in all the history of trade negotiations.
The nations of Latin America at Punta del Este resolved to move toward economic integration.
In Asia, the nations from Korea and Japan to Indonesia and Singapore worked behind America's shield to strengthen their economies and to broaden their political cooperation.
In Africa, from which the distinguished Vice President has just returned, he reports to me that there is a spirit of regional cooperation that is beginning to take hold in very practical ways.
These events we all welcomed.
Yet since I last reported to you, we and the world have been confronted by a number of crises:During the Arab-Israeli war last June, the hot line between Washington and Moscow was used for the first time in our history.
A cease-fire was achieved without a major power confrontation.
Now the nations of the Middle East have the opportunity to cooperate with Ambassador Jarring's U.
N.
mission and they have the responsibility to find the terms of living together in stable peace and dignity, and we shall do all in our power to help them achieve that result.
Not far from this scene of conflict, a crisis flared on Cyprus involving two peoples who are America's friends: Greece and Turkey.
Our very able representative,  Cyrus Vance, and others helped to ease this tension.
Turmoil continues on the mainland of China after a year of violent disruption.
The radical extremism of their Government has isolated the Chinese people behind their own borders.
The United States, however, remains willing to permit the travel of journalists to both our countries; to undertake cultural and educational exchanges; and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop materials.
Since I spoke to you last, the United States and the Soviet Union have taken several important steps toward the goal of international cooperation.
As you will remember, I met with Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro and we achieved if not accord, at least a clearer understanding of our respective positions after 2 days of meeting.
Because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrowed, we have worked with the Soviet Union and with other nations to reach an agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapons.
On the basis of communications from Ambassador Fisher in Geneva this afternoon, I am encouraged to believe that a draft treaty can be laid before the conference in Geneva in the very near future.
I hope to be able to present that treaty to the Senate this year for the Senate's approval.
We achieved, in 1967, a consular treaty with the Soviets, the first commercial air agreement between the two countries, and a treaty banning weapons in outer space.
We shall sign, and submit to the Senate shortly, a new treaty with the Soviets and with others for the protection of astronauts.
Serious differences still remain between us, yet in these relations, we have made some progress since Vienna, the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban missile crisis.
But despite this progress, we must maintain a military force that is capable of deterring any threat to this Nation's security, whatever the mode of aggression.
Our choices must not be confined to total war-or to total acquiescence.
We have such a military force today.
We shall maintain it.
I wishwith all of my heartthat the expenditures that are necessary to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs of peace.
But until world conditions permit, and until peace is assured, America's mightand America's bravest sons who wear our Nation's uniformmust continue to stand guard for all of usas they gallantly do tonight in Vietnam and other places in the world.
Yet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the conditions of peace.
For two decades America has committed itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threatens the peace.
We shall sustain that commitment.
This year I shall propose:That we launch, with other nations, an exploration of the ocean depths to tap its wealth, and its energy, and its abundance.
That we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the International Development Association, and to increase the resources of the Asian Development Bank.
That we adopt a prudent aid program, rooted in the principle of self-help.
That we renew and extend the food for freedom program.
Our food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of famine.
But unless the rapid growth of population in developing countries is slowed, the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily.
Governments in the developing countries must take such facts into consideration.
We in the United States are prepared to help assist them in those efforts.
But we must also improve the lives of children already born in the villages and towns and cities on this earth.
They can be taught by great teachers through space communications and the miracle of satellite television-and we are going to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true.
Let me speak now about some matters here at home.
Tonight our Nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever been accomplished before.
Americans are prosperous as men have never been in recorded history.
Yet there is in the land a certain restlessnessa questioning.
The total of our Nation's annual production is now above $800 billion.
For 83 months this Nation has been on a steady upward trend of growth.
All about them, most American families can see the evidence of growing abundance: higher paychecks, humming factories, new cars moving down new highways.
More and more families own their own homes, equipped with more than 70 million television sets.
A new college is founded every week.
Today more than half of the high school graduates go on to college.
There are hundreds of thousands of fathers and mothers who never completed grammar schoolwho will see their children graduate from college.
Why, then, this restlessness?Because when a great ship cuts through the sea, the waters are always stirred and troubled.
And our ship is moving.
It is moving through troubled and new waters; it is moving toward new and better shores.
We ask now, not how can we achieve abundance?but how shall we use our abundance? Not, is there abundance enough for all?but, how can all share in our abundance?While we have accomplished much, much remains for us to meet and much remains for us to master.
In some areas, the jobless rate is still three or four times the national average.
Violence has shown its face in some of our cities.
Crime increases on our streets.
Income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers; and parity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hopenot an achievement.

Last year, with very little fanfare the Congress and the executive branch moved in that field.
We enacted the Wholesome Meat Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Product Safety Commission, and a law to improve clinical laboratories.
And now, I think, the time has come to complete our unfinished work.
The Senate has already passed the truth-in-lending bill, the fire safety bill, and the pipeline safety laws.
Tonight I plead with the House to immediately act upon these measures and I hope take favorable action upon all of them.
I call upon the Congress to enact, without delay, the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection laws that I submitted to the Congress last year.
I also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the House to guard against fraud and manipulation in the Nation's commodity exchange market.
These measures are a pledge to our people-to keep them safe in their homes and at work, and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace.
And I think we must do more.
I propose:New powers for the Federal Trade Commission to stop those who defraud and who swindle our public.
New safeguards to insure the quality of fish and poultry, and the safety of our community water supplies.
A major study of automobile insurance.
Protection against hazardous radiation from television sets and other electronic equipment.
And to give the consumer a stronger voice, I plan to appoint a consumer counsel in the Justice Departmenta lawyer for the American consumerto work directly under the Attorney General, to serve the President's Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs, and to serve the consumers of this land.
This CongressDemocrats and Republicanscan earn the thanks of history.
We can make this truly a new day for the American consumer, and by giving him this protection we can live in history as the consumer-conscious Congress.
So let us get on with the work.
Let us act soon.
We, at every level of the government, State, local, Federal, know that the American people have had enough of rising crime and lawlessness in this country.
They recognize that law enforcement is first the duty of local police and local government.
They recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime is in the home, the church, the city hall and the county courthouse and the statehousenot in the far-removed National Capital of Washington.
But the people also recognize that the National Government can and the National Government should help the cities and the States in their war on crime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional authority.
And this we shall do.
This does not mean a national police force.
It does mean help and financial support:to develop State and local master plans to combat crime,to provide better training and better pay for police, andto bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city and every county in America.
There is no more urgent business before this Congress than to pass the Safe Streets Act this year that I proposed last year.
That law will provide these required funds.
They are so critically needed that I have doubled my request under this act to $100 million in fiscal 1969.
And I urge the Congress to stop the trade in mail-order murder, to stop it this year by adopting a proper gun control law.
This year, I will propose a Drug Control Act to provide stricter penalties for those who traffic in LSD and other dangerous drugs with our people.
I will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug laws by increasing the number of Federal drug and narcotics control officials by more than 30 percent.
The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young.
I also request you to give us funds to add immediately 100 assistant United States attorneys throughout the land to help prosecute our criminal laws.
We have increased our judiciary by 40 percent and we have increased our prosecutors by 16 percent.
The dockets are full of cases because we do not have assistant district attorneys to go before the Federal judge and handle them.
We start these young lawyers at $8,200 a year.
And the docket is clogged because we do not have authority to hire more of them.
I ask the Congress for authority to hire 100 more.
These young men will give special attention to this drug abuse, too.
Finally, I ask you to add 100 FBI agents to strengthen law enforcement in the Nation and to protect the individual rights of every citizen.
A moment ago I spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where the fires of disorder burned last summer.
We can-and in time we willchange that despair into confidence, and change those frustrations into achievements.
But violence will never bring progress.
We can make progress only by attacking the causes of violence and only where there is civil order founded on justice.
Today we are helping local officials improve their capacity to deal promptly with disorders.
Those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that local authorities are able to resist them swiftly, to resist them sternly, and to resist them decisively.
I shall recommend other actions:To raise the farmers' income by establishing a security commodity reserve that will protect the market from price-depressing stocks and protect the consumer from food scarcity.
I shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively for fair prices.
I shall recommend programs for new air safety measures.
Measures to stem the rising costs of medical care.
Legislation to encourage our returning veterans to devote themselves to careers in community service such as teaching, and being firemen, and joining our police force, and our law enforcement officials.
I shall recommend programs to strengthen and finance our anti-pollution efforts.
Fully funding all of the $2.
18 billion poverty program that you in the Congress had just authorized in order to bring opportunity to those who have been left far behind.
I shall recommend an Educational Opportunity Act to speed up our drive to break down the financial barriers that are separating our young people from college.
I shall also urge the Congress to act on several other vital pending billsespecially the civil rights measuresfair jury trials, protection of Federal rights, enforcement of equal employment opportunity, and fair housing.
The unfinished work of the first session must be completedthe Higher Education Act, the Juvenile Delinquency Act, conservation measures to save the redwoods of California, and to preserve the wonders of our scenic rivers, the Highway Beautification Actand all the other measures for a cleaner, and for a better, and for a more beautiful America.
Next month we will begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity.
The economic outlook for this year is one of steady growth-if we are vigilant.
True, there are some clouds on the horizon.
Prices are rising.
Interest rates have passed the peak of 1966; and if there is continued inaction on the tax bill, they will climb even higher.
I warn the Congress and the Nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep us into an accelerating spiral of price increases, a slump in homebuilding, and a continuing erosion of the American dollar.
This would be a tragedy for every American family.
And I predict that if this happens, they will all let us know about it.
Wethose of us in the executive branch, in the Congress, and the leaders of labor and businessmust do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune.
Under the new budget, the expenditures for 1969 will increase by $10.
4 billion.
Receipts will increase by $22.
3 billion including the added tax revenues.
Virtually all of this expenditure increase represents the mandatory cost of our defense efforts, $3 billion; increased interest, almost $1 billion; or mandatory payments under laws passed by Congresssuch as those provided in the Social Security Act that you passed in 1967, and to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, veterans, and farmers, of about $4 1/2 billion; and the additional $1 billion 600 million next year for the pay increases that you passed in military and civilian pay.
That makes up the $10 billion that is added to the budget.
With few exceptions, very few, we are holding the fiscal 1969 budget to last year's level, outside of those mandatory and required increases.
A Presidential commission composed of distinguished congressional fiscal leaders and other prominent Americans recommended this year that we adopt a new budget approach.
I am carrying out their recommendations in this year's budget.
This budget, therefore, for the first time accurately covers all Federal expenditures and all Federal receipts, including for the first time in one budget $47 billion from the social security, Medicare, highway, and other trust funds.
The fiscal 1969 budget has expenditures of approximately $186 billion, with total estimated revenues, including the tax bill, of about $178 billion.
If the Congress enacts the tax increase, we will reduce the budget deficit by some $12 billion.
The war in Vietnam is costing us about $25 billion and we are asking for about $12 billion in taxesand if we get that $12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $20 billion in 1968 to about $8 billion in 1969.
Now, this is a tight budget.
It follows the reduction that I made in cooperation with the Congressa reduction made after you had reviewed every appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $5 or $6 billion and expenditures by $1.
5 billion.
We conferred together and I recommended to the Congress and you subsequently approved taking 2 percent from payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures.
We therefore reduced appropriations almost $10 billion last session and expenditures over $4 billion.
Now, that was in the budget last year.
I ask the Congress to recognize that there are certain selected programs that meet the Nation's most urgent needs and they have increased.
We have insisted that decreases in very desirable but less urgent programs be made before we would approve any increases.
So I ask the Congress tonight:to hold its appropriations to the budget requests, andto act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which for the average American individual amounts to about a penny out of each dollar's income.
This tax increase would yield about half of the $23 billion per year that we returned to the people in the tax reduction bills of 1964 and 1965.
This must be a temporary measure, which expires in less than 2 years.
Congress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed.
But Congress can never repeal inflation.
The leaders of American business and the leaders of American laborthose who really have power over wages and pricesmust act responsibly, and in their Nation's interest by keeping increases in line with productivity.
If our recognized leaders do not do this, they and those for whom they speak and all of us are going to suffer very serious consequences.
On January 1st, I outlined a program to reduce our balance of payments deficit sharply this year.
We will ask the Congress to help carry out those parts of the program which require legislation.
We must restore equilibrium to our balance of payments.
We must also strengthen the international monetary system.
We have assured the world that America's full gold stock stands behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at $35 an ounce.
We must back this commitment by legislating now to free our gold reserves.
Americans, traveling more than any other people in history, took $4 billion out of their country last year in travel costs.
We must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $2 billion.
We are hoping that we can reduce it by $500 millionwithout unduly penalizing the travel of teachers, students, business people who have essential and necessary travel, or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to see.
Even with this reduction of $500 million, the American people will still be traveling more overseas than they did in 1967, 1966, or 1965 or any other year in their history.
If we act together as I hope we can, I believe we can continue our economic expansion which has already broken all past records.
And I hope that we can continue that expansion in the days ahead.
Each of these questions I have discussed with you tonight is a question of policy for our people.
Therefore, each of them should beand doubtless will bedebated by candidates for public office this year.
I hope those debates will be marked by new proposals and by a seriousness that matches the gravity of the questions themselves.
These are not appropriate subjects for narrow partisan oratory.
They go to the heart of what we Americans are all aboutall of us, Democrats and Republicans.
Tonight I have spoken of some of the goals I should like to see America reach.
Many of them can be achieved this year-others by the time we celebrate our Nation's 200th birthdaythe bicentennial of our independence.
Several of these goals are going to be very hard to reach.
But the State of our Union will be much stronger 8 years from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach these goals now.
They are more important-much more importantthan the identity of the party or the President who will then be in office.
These goals are what the fighting and our alliances are really meant to protect.
Can we achieve these goals?Of course we canif we will.
If ever there was a people who sought more than mere abundance, it is our people.
If ever there was a nation that was capable of solving its problems, it is this Nation.
If ever there were a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of being an Americanit is this time.
So this, my friends, is the State of our Union: seeking, building, tested many times in this past yearand always equal to the test.
Thank you and good night.
Good evening, my fellow Americans:Tonight I want to speak to you of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
No other question so preoccupies our people.
No other dream so absorbs the 250 million human beings who live in that part of the world.
No other goal motivates American policy in Southeast Asia.
For years, representatives of our Government and others have traveled the world-seeking to find a basis for peace talks.
Since last September, they have carried the offer that I made public at San Antonio.
That offer was this:That the United States would stop its bombardment of North Vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussions  and that we would assume that North Vietnam would not take military advantage of our restraint.
Hanoi denounced this offer, both privately and publicly.
Even while the search for peace was going on, North Vietnam rushed their preparations for a savage assault on the people, the government, and the allies of South Vietnam.
Their attack  during the Tet holidays  failed to achieve its principal objectives.
It did not collapse the elected government of South Vietnam or shatter its army  as the Communists had hoped.
It did not produce a general uprising among the people of the cities as they had predicted.
The Communists were unable to maintain control of any of the more than 30 cities that they attacked.
And they took very heavy casualties.
But they did compel the South Vietnamese and their allies to move certain forces from the countryside into the cities.
They caused widespread disruption and suffering.
Their attacks, and the battles that followed, made refugees of half a million human beings.
The Communists may renew their attack any day.
They are, it appears, trying to make 1968 the year of decision in South Vietnam  the year that brings, if not final victory or defeat, at least a turning point in the struggle.
This much is clear:If they do mount another round of heavy attacks, they will not succeed in destroying the fighting power of South Vietnam and its allies.
But tragically, this is also clear: Many men  on both sides of the struggle  will be lost.
A nation that has already suffered 20 years of warfare will suffer once again.
Armies on both sides will take new casualties.
And the war will go on.
There is no need for this to be so.
There is no need to delay the talks that could bring an end to this long and this bloody war.
Tonight, I renew the offer I made last August  to stop the bombardment of North Vietnam.
We ask that talks begin promptly, that they be serious talks on the substance of peace.
We assume that during those talks Hanoi will not take advantage of our restraint.
We are prepared to move immediately toward peace through negotiations.
So, tonight, in the hope that this action will lead to early talks, I am taking the first step to deescalate the conflict.
We are reducing  substantially reducing  the present level of hostilities.
And we are doing so unilaterally, and at once.
Tonight, I have ordered our aircraft and our naval vessels to make no attacks on North Vietnam, except in the area north of the demilitarized zone where the continuing enemy buildup directly threatens allied forward positions and where the movements of their troops and supplies are clearly related to that threat.
The area in which we are stopping our attacks includes almost 90 percent of North Vietnam's population, and most of its territory.
Thus there will be no attacks around the principal populated areas, or in the food-producing areas of North Vietnam.
Even this very limited bombing of the North could come to an early end  if our restraint is matched by restraint in Hanoi.
But I cannot in good conscience stop all bombing so long as to do so would immediately and directly endanger the lives of our men and our allies.
Whether a complete bombing halt becomes possible in the future will be determined by events.
Our purpose in this action is to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exists.
It is to save the lives of brave men  and to save the lives of innocent women and children.
It is to permit the contending forces to move closer to a political settlement.
And tonight, I call upon the United Kingdom and I call upon the Soviet Union  as cochairmen of the Geneva Conferences, and as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  to do all they can to move from the unilateral act of deescalation that I have just announced toward genuine peace in Southeast Asia.
Now, as in the past, the United States is ready to send its representatives to any forum, at any time, to discuss the means of bringing this ugly war to an end.
I am designating one of our most distinguished Americans, Ambassador Averell Harriman, as my personal representative for such talks.
In addition, I have asked Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson, who returned from Moscow for consultation, to be available to join Ambassador Harriman at Geneva or any other suitable place  just as soon as Hanoi agrees to a conference.
I call upon President Ho Chi Minh to respond positively, and favorably, to this new step toward peace.
But if peace does not come now through negotiations, it will come when Hanoi understands that our common resolve is unshakable, and our common strength is invincible.
Tonight, we and the other allied nations are contributing 600,000 fighting men to assist 700,000 South Vietnamese troops in defending their little country.
Our presence there has always rested on this basic belief: The main burden of preserving their freedom must be carried out by them  by the South Vietnamese themselves.
We and our allies can only help to provide a shield behind which the people of South Vietnam can survive and can grow and develop.
On their efforts  on their determination and resourcefulness  the outcome will ultimately depend.
That small, beleaguered nation has suffered terrible punishment for more than 20 years.
I pay tribute once again tonight to the great courage and endurance of its people.
South Vietnam supports armed forces tonight of almost 700,000 men  and I call your attention to the fact that this is the equivalent of more than 10 million in our own population.
Its people maintain their firm determination to be free of domination by the North.
There has been substantial progress, I think, in building a durable government during these last 3 years.
The South Vietnam of 1965 could not have survived the enemy's Tet offensive of 1968.
The elected government of South Vietnam survived that attack  and is rapidly repairing the devastation that it wrought.
The South Vietnamese know that further efforts are going to be required:  to expand their own armed forces,  to move back into the countryside as quickly as possible,  to increase their taxes,  to select the very best men that they have for civil and military responsibility,  to achieve a new unity within their constitutional government, and  to include in the national effort all those groups who wish to preserve South.
Vietnam's control over its own destiny.
Last week President Thieu ordered the mobilization of 135,000 additional South Vietnamese.
He plans to reach  as soon as possible  a total military strength of more than 800,000 men.
To achieve this, the Government of South Vietnam started the drafting of 19-year-olds on March 1st.
On May 1st, the Government will begin the drafting of 18-year-olds.
Last month, 10,000 men volunteered for military service  that was two and a half times the number of volunteers during the same month last year.
Since the middle of January, more than 48,000 South Vietnamese have joined the armed forces  and nearly half of them volunteered to do so.
All men in the South Vietnamese armed forces have had their tours of duty extended for the duration of the war, and reserves are now being called up for immediate active duty.
President Thieu told his people last week: We must make greater efforts and accept more sacrifices because, as I have said many times, this is our country.
The existence of our nation is at stake, and this is mainly a Vietnamese responsibility.
He warned his people that a major national effort is required to root out corruption and incompetence at all levels of government.
We applaud this evidence of determination on the part of South Vietnam.
Our first priority will be to support their effort.
We shall accelerate the reequipment of South Vietnam's armed forces  in order to meet the enemy's increased firepower.
This will enable them progressively to undertake a larger share of combat operations against the Communist invaders.
On many occasions I have told the American people that we would send to Vietnam those forces that are required to accomplish our mission there.
So, with that as our guide, we have previously authorized a force level of approximately 525,000.
Some weeks ago  to help meet the enemy's new offensive  we sent to Vietnam about 11,000 additional Marine and airborne troops.
They were deployed by air in 48 hours, on an emergency basis.
But the artillery, tank, aircraft, medical, and other units that were needed to work with and to support these infantry troops in combat could not then accompany them by air on that short notice.
In order that these forces may reach maximum combat effectiveness, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended to me that we should prepare to send  during the next 5 months  support troops totaling approximately 13,500 men.
A portion of these men will be made available from our active forces.
The balance will come from reserve component units which will be called up for service.
The actions that we have taken since the beginning of the year  to reequip the South Vietnamese forces,  to meet our responsibilities in Korea, as well as our responsibilities in Vietnam,  to meet price increases and the cost of activating and deploying reserve forces,  to replace helicopters and provide the other military supplies we need, all of these actions are going to require additional expenditures.
The tentative estimate of those additional expenditures is $2.
5 billion in this fiscal year, and $2.
6 billion in the next fiscal year.
These projected increases in expenditures for our national security will bring into sharper focus the Nation's need for immediate action: action to protect the prosperity of the American people and to protect the strength and the stability of our American dollar.
On many occasions I have pointed out that, without a tax bill or decreased expenditures, next year's deficit would again be around $20 billion.
I have emphasized the need to set strict priorities in our spending.
I have stressed that failure to act and to act promptly and decisively would raise very strong doubts throughout the world about America's willingness to keep its financial house in order.
Yet Congress has not acted.
And tonight we face the sharpest financial threat in the postwar era  a threat to the dollar's role as the keystone of international trade and finance in the world.
Last week, at the monetary conference in Stockholm, the major industrial countries decided to take a big step toward creating a new international monetary asset that will strengthen the international monetary system.
I am very proud of the very able work done by Secretary Fowler and Chairman Martin of the Federal Reserve Board.
But to make this system work the United States just must bring its balance of payments to  or very close to  equilibrium.
We must have a responsible fiscal policy in this country.
The passage of a tax bill now, together with expenditure control that the Congress may desire and dictate, is absolutely necessary to protect this Nation's security, to continue our prosperity, and to meet the needs of our people.
What is at stake is 7 years of unparalleled prosperity.
In those 7 years, the real income of the average American, after taxes, rose by almost 30 percent  a gain as large as that of the entire preceding 19 years.
So the steps that we must take to convince the world are exactly the steps we must take to sustain our own economic strength here at home.
In the past 8 months, prices and interest rates have risen because of our inaction.
We must, therefore, now do everything we can to move from debate to action  from talking to voting.
There is, I believe  I hope there is  in both Houses of the Congress  a growing sense of urgency that this situation just must be acted upon and must be corrected.
My budget in January was, we thought, a tight one.
It fully reflected our evaluation of most of the demanding needs of this Nation.
But in these budgetary matters, the President does not decide alone.
The Congress has the power and the duty to determine appropriations and taxes.
The Congress is now considering our proposals and they are considering reductions in the budget that we submitted.
As part of a program of fiscal restraint that includes the tax surcharge, I shall approve appropriate reductions in the January budget when and if Congress so decides that that should be done.
One thing is unmistakably clear, however: Our deficit just must be reduced.
Failure to act could bring on conditions that would strike hardest at those people that all of us are trying so hard to help.
These times call for prudence in this land of plenty.
I believe that we have the character to provide it, and tonight I plead with the Congress and with the people to act promptly to serve the national interest, and thereby serve all of our people.
Now let me give you my estimate of the chances for peace:  the peace that will one day stop the bloodshed in South Vietnam,  that will permit all the Vietnamese people to rebuild and develop their land,  that will permit us to turn more fully to our own tasks here at home.
I cannot promise that the initiative that I have announced tonight will be completely successful in achieving peace any more than the 30 others that we have undertaken and agreed to in recent years.
But it is our fervent hope that North Vietnam, after years of fighting that have left the issue unresolved, will now cease its efforts to achieve a military victory and will join with us in moving toward the peace table.
And there may come a time when South Vietnamese  on both sides  are able to work out a way to settle their own differences by free political choice rather than by war.
As Hanoi considers its course, it should be in no doubt of our intentions.
It must not miscalculate the pressures within our democracy in this election year.
We have no intention of widening this war.
But the United States will never accept a fake solution to this long and arduous struggle and call it peace.
No one can foretell the precise terms of an eventual settlement.
Our objective in South Vietnam has never been the annihilation of the enemy.
It has been to bring about a recognition in Hanoi that its objective  taking over the South by force  could not be achieved.
We think that peace can be based on the Geneva Accords of 1954  under political conditions that permit the South Vietnamese  all the South Vietnamese  to chart their course free of any outside domination or interference, from us or from anyone else.
So tonight I reaffirm the pledge that we made at Manila  that we are prepared to withdraw our forces from South Vietnam as the other side withdraws its forces to the north, stops the infiltration, and the level of violence thus subsides.
Our goal of peace and self-determination in Vietnam is directly related to the future of all of Southeast Asiawhere much has happened to inspire confidence during the past 10 years.
We have done all that we knew how to do to contribute and to help build that confidence.
A number of its nations have shown what can be accomplished under conditions of security.
Since 1966, Indonesia, the fifth largest nation in all the world, with a population of more than 100 million people, has had a government that is dedicated to peace with its neighbors and improved conditions for its own people.
Political and economic cooperation between nations has grown rapidly.
I think every American can take a great deal of pride in the role that we have played in bringing this about in Southeast Asia.
We can rightly judge  as responsible Southeast Asians themselves do  that the progress of the past 3 years would have been far less likely  if not completely impossible  if America's sons and others had not made their stand in Vietnam.
At Johns Hopkins University, about 3 years ago, I announced that the United States would take part in the great work of developing Southeast Asia, including the Mekong Valley, for all the people of that region.
Our determination to help build a better land  a better land for men on both sides of the present conflict  has not diminished in the least.
Indeed, the ravages of war, I think, have made it more urgent than ever.
So, I repeat on behalf of the United States again tonight what I said at Johns Hopkins  that North Vietnam could take its place in this common effort just as soon as peace comes.
Over time, a wider framework of peace and security in Southeast Asia may become possible.
The new cooperation of the nations of the area could be a foundation-stone.
Certainly friendship with the nations of such a Southeast Asia is what the United States seeks  and that is all that the United States seeks.
One day, my fellow citizens, there will be peace in Southeast Asia.
It will come because the people of Southeast Asia want it  those whose armies are at war tonight, and those who, though threatened, have thus far been spared.
Peace will come because Asians were willing to work for it  and to sacrifice for it  and to die by the thousands for it.
But let it never be forgotten: Peace will come also because America sent her sons to help secure it.
It has not been easy  far from it.
During the past 4 years, it has been my fate and my responsibility to be Commander in Chief.
I have lived  daily and nightly  with the cost of this war.
I know the pain that it has inflicted.
I know, perhaps better than anyone, the misgivings that it has aroused.
Throughout this entire, long period, I have been sustained by a single principle: that what we are doing now, in Vietnam, is vital not only to the security of Southeast Asia, but it is vital to the security of every American.
Surely we have treaties which we must respect.
Surely we have commitments that we are going to keep.
Resolutions of the Congress testify to the need to resist aggression in the world and in Southeast Asia.
But the heart of our involvement in South Vietnam  under three different presidents, three separate administrations  has always been America's own security.
And the larger purpose of our involvement has always been to help the nations of Southeast Asia become independent and stand alone, self-sustaining, as members of a great world community  at peace with themselves, and at peace with all others.
With such an Asia, our country  and the world  will be far more secure than it is tonight.
I believe that a peaceful Asia is far nearer to reality because of what America has done in Vietnam.
I believe that the men who endure the dangers of battle  fighting there for us tonight  are helping the entire world avoid far greater conflicts, far wider wars, far more destruction, than this one.
The peace that will bring them home someday will come.
Tonight I have offered the first in what I hope will be a series of mutual moves toward peace.
I pray that it will not be rejected by the leaders of North Vietnam.
I pray that they will accept it as a means by which the sacrifices of their own people may be ended.
And I ask your help and your support, my fellow citizens, for this effort to reach across the battlefield toward an early peace.
Finally, my fellow Americans, let me say this:Of those to whom much is given, much is asked.
I cannot say and no man could say that no more will be asked of us.
Yet, I believe that now, no less than when the decade began, this generation of Americans is willing to pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
Since those words were spoken by John F.
Kennedy, the people of America have kept that compact with mankind's noblest cause.
And we shall continue to keep it.
Yet, I believe that we must always be mindful of this one thing, whatever the trials and the tests ahead.
The ultimate strength of our country and our cause will lie not in powerful weapons or infinite resources or boundless wealth, but will lie in the unity of our people.
This I believe very deeply.
Throughout my entire public career I have followed the personal philosophy that I am a free man, an American, a public servant, and a member of my party, in that order always and only.
For 37 years in the service of our Nation, first as a Congressman, as a Senator, and as Vice President, and now as your President, I have put the unity of the people first.
I have put it ahead of any divisive partisanship.
And in these times as in times before, it is true that a house divided against itself by the spirit of faction, of party, of region, of religion, of race, is a house that cannot stand.
There is division in the American house now.
There is divisiveness among us all tonight.
And holding the trust that is mine, as President of all the people, I cannot disregard the peril to the progress of the American people and the hope and the prospect of peace for all peoples.
So, I would ask all Americans, whatever their personal interests or concern, to guard against divisiveness and all its ugly consequences.
Fifty-two months and 10 days ago, in a moment of tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me.
I asked then for your help and God's, that we might continue America on its course, binding up our wounds, healing our history, moving forward in new unity, to clear the American agenda and to keep the American commitment for all of our people.
United we have kept that commitment.
United we have enlarged that commitment.
Through all time to come, I think America will be a stronger nation, a more just society, and a land of greater opportunity and fulfillment because of what we have all done together in these years of unparalleled achievement.
Our reward will come in the life of freedom, peace, and hope that our children will enjoy through ages ahead.
What we won when all of our people united just must not now be lost in suspicion, distrust, selfishness, and politics among any of our people.
Believing this as I do, I have concluded that I should not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year.
With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office  the Presidency of your country.
Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.
But let men everywhere know, however, that a strong, a confident, and a vigilant America stands ready tonight to seek an honorable peace  and stands ready tonight to defend an honored cause  whatever the price, whatever the burden, whatever the sacrifice that duty may require.
Thank you for listening.
Good night and God bless all of you.
Mayor Daley,  Wasilewski, ladies and gentlemen: Some of you might have thought from what I said last night that I had been taking elocution lessons from Lowell Thomas.
One of my aides said this morning, Things are really getting confused around Washington,  PresidentI said, How is that?He said, It looks to me like you are going to the wrong convention in ChicagoI said, Well, what you overlooked was that it is April Fool.
Once again we are entering the period of national festivity which Henry Adams called the dance of democracy.
At its best, that can be a time of debate and enlightenment.
At its worst, it can be a period of frenzy.
But always it is a time when emotion threatens to substitute for reason.
Yet the basic hope of a democracy is that somehow-amid all the frenzy and all the emotion-in the end, reason will prevail.
Reason just must prevailif democracy itself is to survive.
As I said last evening, there are very deep and very emotional divisions in this land that we love todaydomestic divisions, divisions over the war in Vietnam.
With all of my heart, I just wish this were not so.
My entire career in public lifesome 37 years of ithas been devoted to the art of finding an area of agreement because generally speaking, I have observed that there are so many more things to unite us Americans than there are to divide us.
But somehow or other, we have a facility sometimes of emphasizing the divisions and the things that divide us instead of discussing the things that unite us.
Sometimes I have been called a seeker of consensusmore often that has been criticism of my actions instead of praise of them.
But I have never denied it.
Because to heal and to build support, to hold people together, is something I think is worthy and I believe it is a noble task.
It is certainly a challenge for all of us in this land and this world where there is restlessness and uncertainty and danger.
In my region of the country where I have spent my life, where brother was once divided against brother, my heritage has burned this lesson and it has burned it deep in my memory.
Yet along the way I learned somewhere that no leader can pursue public tranquillity as his first and only goal.
For a President to buy public popularity at the sacrifice of his better judgment is too dear a price to pay.
This Nation cannot afford such a price, and this Nation cannot long afford such a leader.
So, the things that divide our country this morning will be discussed throughout the land.
I am certain that the very great majority of informed Americans will act, as they have always acted, to do what is best for their country and what serves the national interest.
But the real problem of informing the people is still with us.
I think I can speak with some authority about the problem of communication.
I understand, far better than some of my severe and perhaps intolerant critics would admit, my own shortcomings as a communicator.
How does a public leader find just the right word or the right way to say no more or no less than he means to saybearing in mind that anything he says may topple governments and may involve the lives of innocent men?How does that leader speak the right phrase, in the right way, under the right conditions, to suit the accuracies and contingencies of the moment when he is discussing questions of policy, so that he does not stir a thousand misinterpretations and leave the wrong connotation or impression?How does he reach the immediate audience and how does he communicate with the millions of others who are out there listening from afar?The President, who must call his people and summon them to meet their responsibilities as citizens in a hard and an enduring war, often ponders these questions and searches for the right course.
You men and women who are masters of the broadcast media surely must know what I am talking about.
It was a long time ago when a President once said, The printing press is the most powerful weapon with which man has ever armed himself.
In our age, the electronic media have added immeasurably to man's power.
You have within your hands the means to make our Nation as intimate and as informed as a New England town meeting.
Yet the use of broadcasting has not cleared away all of the problems that we still have of communications.
In some ways, I think, sometimes it has complicated them, because it tends to put the leader in a time capsule.
It requires him often to abbreviate what he has to say.
Too often, it may catch a random phrase from his rather lengthy discourse and project it as the whole story.
How many men, I wonder, Mayor Daley, in public life have watched themselves on a TV newscast and then been tempted to exclaim, Can that really be me?Well, there is no denying it: You of the broadcast industry have enormous power in your hands.
You have the power to clarify and you have the power to confuse.
Men in public life cannot remotely rival your opportunityclay after day, night after night, hour after hour on the hourand the half hour, sometimesyou shape the Nation's dialogue.
The words that you choose, hopefully always accurate, and hopefully always just, are the words that are carried out for all of the people to hear.
The commentary that you provide can give the real meaning to the issues of the day or it can distort them beyond all meaning.
By your standards of what is news, you can cultivate wisdomor you can nurture misguided passion.
Your commentary carries an added element of uncertainty.
Unlike the printed media, television writes on the wind.
There is no accumulated record which the historian can examine later with a 20-20 vision of hindsight, asking these questions: How fair was he tonight? How impartial was he today? How honest was he all along?Well, I hope the National Association of Broadcasters, with whom I have had a pleasant association for many years, will point the way to all of us in developing this kind of a record because history is going to be asking very hard questions about our times and the period through which we are passing.
I think that we all owe it to history to complete the record.
But I did not come here this morning to sermonize.
In matters of fairness and judgment, no law or no set of regulations and no words of mine can improve you or dictate your daily responsibility.
All I mean to do, and what I am trying to do, is to remind you where there is great power, there must also be great responsibility.
This is true for broadcasters just as it is true for Presidentsand seekers for the Presidency.
What we say and what we do now will shape the kind of a world that we pass along to our children and our grandchildren.
I keep this thought constantly in my mind during the long days and the somewhat longer nights when crisis comes at home and abroad.
I took a little of your prime time last night.
I would not have done that except for a very prime purpose.
I reported on the prospects for peace in Vietnam.
I announced that the United States is taking a very important unilateral act of de-escalation which couldand I fervently pray willlead to mutual moves to reduce the level of violence and to deescalate the war.
As I sat in my office last evening, waiting to speak, I thought of the many times each week when television brings the war into the American home.
No one can say exactly what effect those vivid scenes have on American opinion.
Historians must only guess at the effect that television would have had during earlier conflicts on the future of this Nation:during the Korean war, for example, at that time when our forces were pushed back there to Pusan;or World War II, the Battle of the Bulge, or when our men were slugging it out in Europe or when most of our Air Force was shot down that day in June 1942 off Australia.
But last night television was being used to carry a different message.
It was a message of peace.
It occurred to me that the medium may be somewhat better suited to conveying the actions of conflict than to dramatizing the words that the leaders use in trying and hoping to end the conflict.
Certainly, it is more dramatic to show policemen and rioters locked in combat than to show men trying to cooperate with one another.
The face of hatred and of bigotry comes through much more clearlyno matter what its color.
The face of tolerance, I seem to find, is rarely newsworthy.
Progresswhether it is a man being trained for a job or millions being trained or whether it is a child in Head Start learning to read or an older person of 72 in adult education or being cared for in Medicare-rarely makes the news, although more than 20 million of them are affected by it.
Perhaps this is because tolerance and progress are not dynamic eventssuch as riots and conflicts are events.
Peace, in the news sense, is a condition.
War is an event.
Part of your responsibility is simply to understand the consequences of that fact-the consequences of your own acts, and part of that responsibility, I think, is to tryas very best we all canto draw the attention of our people to the real business of society in our systemfinding and securing peace in the worldat home and abroad.
For all that you have done and that you are doing and that you will do to this end, I thank you and I commend you.
I pray that the message of peace that I tried so hard to convey last night will be accepted in good faith by the leaders of North Vietnam.
I pray that one time soon, the evening news show will have, not another battle in the scarred hills of Vietnam, but will show men entering a room to talk about peace.
That is the event that I think the American people are yearning and longing to see.
President Thieu of Vietnam and his Government are now engaged in very urgent political and economic tasks which I referred to last nightand which we regard as very constructive and hopeful.
We hope the Government of South Vietnam makes great progress in the days ahead.
But some time in the weeks ahead-immediately, I hopePresident Thieu will be in a position to accept my invitation to visit the United States so he can come here and see our people too, and together we can strengthen and improve our plans to advance the day of peace.
I pray that you and that every American will take to heart my plea that we guard against divisiveness.
We have won too much, we have come too far, and we have opened too many doors of opportunity, for these things now to be lost in a divided country where brother is separated from brother.
For the time that is allotted me, I shall do everything in one man's power to hasten the day when the world is at peace and Americans of all racesand all creedsof all convictions-can live togetherwithout fear or without suspicion or without distrustin unity, and in common purpose.
United we are strong; divided we are in great danger.
In speaking as I did to the Nation last night, I was moved by the very deep convictions that I entertain about the nature of the office that it is my present privilege to hold.
The Office of the Presidency is the only office in this land of all the people.
Whatever may be the personal wishes or preferences of any man who holds it, a President of all the people can afford no thought of self.
At no time and in no way and for no reason can a President allow the integrity or the responsibility or the freedom of the office ever to be compromised or diluted or destroyed because when you destroy it, you destroy yourselves.
I hope and I pray that by not allowing the Presidency to be involved in divisions and deep partisanship, I shall be able to pass on to my successor a stronger officestrong enough to guard and defend all the people against all the storms that the future may bring us.
You men and women who have come here to this great progressive city of Chicago, led by this dynamic and great public servant, Dick Daley, are yourselves charged with a peculiar responsibility.
You are yourselves trustees, legally accepted trustees and legally selected trustees of a great institution on which the freedom of our land utterly depends.
The security, the success of our country, what happens to us tomorrowrests squarely upon the media which disseminate the truth on which the decisions of democracy are made.
An informed mindand we get a great deal of our information from youis the guardian genius of democracy.
So, you are the keepers of a trust.
You must be just.
You must guard and you must defend your media against the spirit of faction, against the works of divisiveness and bigotry, against the corrupting evils of partisanship in any guise.
For America's press, as for the American Presidency, the integrity and the responsibility and the freedomthe freedom to know the truth and let the truth make us freemust never be compromised or diluted or destroyed.
The defense of our media is your responsibility.
Government cannot and must not and never willas long as I have anything to do about itintervene in that role.
But I do want to leave this thought with you as I leave you this morning: I hope that you will give this trust your closest care, acting as I know you can, to guard not only against the obvious, but to watch for the hiddenthe sometimes unintentional, the often petty intrusions upon the integrity of the information by which Americans decide.
Men and women of the airways fully-as much as men and women of public service-have a public trust and if liberty is to survive and to succeed, that solemn trust must be faithfully kept.
I do not wantand I do not think you wantto wake up some morning and find America changed because we slept when we should have been awake, because we remained silent when we should have spoken up, because we went along with what was popular and fashionable and in rather than what was necessary and what was right.
Being faithful to our trust ought to be the prime test of any public trustee in office or on the airways.
In any society, all you students of history know that a time of division is a time of danger.
And in these times now we must never forget that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
Thank you for wanting me to come.
I have enjoyed it.
TODAY the Government of North Vietnam made a statement which included the following paragraph, and I quote: However, for its part, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares its readiness to appoint its representatives to contact the United States representative with a view to determining with the American side the unconditional cessation of the United States bombing raids and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam so that talks may start.
Last Sunday night I expressed the position of the United States with respect to peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia as follows: Now, as in the past, the United States is ready to send its representatives to any forum, at any time, to discuss the means of bringing this war to an end.
Accordingly, we will establish contact with the representatives of North Vietnam.
Consultations with the Government of South Vietnam and our other allies are now taking place.
So that you may have as much notice as I am able to give you on another matter, I will be leaving tomorrow evening, late, for Honolulu.
I will meet with certain of our representatives, American representatives from South Vietnam, for a series of meetings over the weekend in Hawaii.
Thank you very much.

Members of the Congress, Members of the Cabinet, distinguished Americans, and guests:On an April afternoon in the year 1966, I asked a distinguished group of citizens who were interested in human rights to meet me in the Cabinet Room in the White House.
In their presence that afternoon, I signed a message to the Congress.
That message called for the enactment of the first effective federal law against discrimination in the sale and the rental of housing in the United States of America.
Few in the Nation  and the record will show that very few in that room that afternoon  believed that fair housing would  in our time  become the unchallenged law of this land.
And indeed, this bill has had a long and stormy trip.
We did not get it in 1966.
We pleaded for it again in 1967.
But the Congress took no action that year.
We asked for it again this year.
And now  at long last this afternoon  its day has come.
I do not exaggerate when I say that the proudest moments of my Presidency have been times such as this when I have signed into law the promises of a century.
I shall never forget that it was more than 100 years ago when Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation  but it was a proclamation; it was not a fact.
In the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we affirmed through law that men equal under God are also equal when they seek a job, when they go to get a meal in a restaurant, or when they seek lodging for the night in any State in the Union.
Now the Negro families no longer suffer the humiliation of being turned away because of their race.
In the Civil Rights Act of 1965, we affirmed through law for every citizen in this land the most basic right of democracy  the right of a citizen to vote in an election in his country.
In the five States where the Act had its greater impact, Negro voter registration has already more than doubled.
Now, with this bill, the voice of justice speaks again.
It proclaims that fair housing for all  all human beings who live in this country  is now a part of the American way of life.
We all know that the roots of injustice run deep.
But violence cannot redress a solitary wrong, or remedy a single unfairness.
Of course, all America is outraged at the assassination of an outstanding Negro leader who was at that meeting that afternoon in the White House in 1966.
And America is also outraged at the looting and the burning that defiles our democracy.
We just must put our shoulders together and put a stop to both.
The time is here.
Action must be now.
So, I would appeal to my fellow Americans by saying, the only real road to progress for free people is through the process of law and that is the road that America will travel.
I urge the Congress to enact the measures for social justice that I have recommended in some twenty messages.
These messages went to the Congress in January and February of this year.
They broke a precedent by being completed and delivered and read and printed.
These measures provide more than $78 billion that I have urged the Congress to enact for major domestic programs for all Americans in the fiscal 1969 budget.
This afternoon, as we gather here in this historic room in the White House, I think we can all take some heart that democracy's work is being done.
In the Civil Rights Act of 1968 America does move forward and the bell of freedom rings out a little louder.
We have come some of the way, not near all of it.
There is much yet to do.
If the Congress sees fit to act upon these twenty messages and some fifteen appropriations bills, I assure you that what remains to be done will be recommended in ample time for you to do it after you have completed what is already before you.
Thank you very much.
Secretary Rusk, Your Excellencies, honored Members of Congress, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:This is a very reassuring and hopeful moment in the relations among nations.
We have come here today to the East Room of the White House to sign a treaty which limits the spread of nuclear weapons.
More than 55 nations are here in Washington this morning to commit their governments to this treaty.
Their representatives are also signing today in Moscow and in London.
We hope and expect that virtually all the nations will move in the weeks and months ahead to accept this treaty which was commended to the world by the overwhelming majority of the members of the United Nations General Assembly.
The treaty's purposes are very simple:  to commit the nations of the world which do not now have nuclear weapons not to produce or receive them in the future;  to assure equally that such nations have the full peaceful benefits of the atom; and  to commit the nuclear powers to move forward toward effective measures of arms control and disarmament.
It was just a year ago that Chairman Kosygin and I agreed at Glassboro that we would work intensively in the time ahead to try to achieve this result.
After nearly a quarter century of danger and fear  reason and sanity have prevailed to reduce the danger and to greatly lessen the fear.
Thus, all mankind is reassured.
As the moment is reassuring, so it is, even more, hopeful and heartening.
For this treaty is evidence that amid the tensions, the strife, the struggle, and the sorrow of these years, men of many nations have not lost the way  or have not lost the will  toward peace.
The conclusion of this treaty encourages the hope that other steps may be taken toward a peaceful world.
It is for these reasons  and in this perspective  that I have described this treaty as the most important international agreement since the beginning of the nuclear age.
It enhances the security of all nations by significantly reducing the danger of nuclear war among nations.
It encourages the peaceful use of nuclear energy by assuring safeguards against its destructive use.
But, perhaps most significantly, the signing of this treaty keeps alive and keeps active the impulse toward a safer world.
We are inclined to neglect and to overlook what that impulse has brought about in recent years.
These have been fruitful times for the quiet works of diplomacy.
After long seasons of patient and painstaking negotiation, we have concluded, just within the past 5 years:  the Limited Test Ban Treaty,  the Outer Space Treaty, and  the treaty creating a nuclear-free zone in Latin America.
The march of mankind is toward the summit  not the chasm.
We must not, we shall not, allow that march to be interrupted.
This treaty, like the treaties it follows, is not the work, as Secretary Rusk said, of any one particular nation.
It is the accomplishment of nations which seek to exercise their responsibilities for maintaining peace and maintaining a stable world order.
It is my hope  and the common will of mankind  that all nations will agree that this treaty affords them some added protection.
We hope they will accept the treaty and thereby contribute further to international peace and security.
As one of the nations having nuclear weapons, the United States  all through these years  has borne an awesome responsibility.
This treaty increases that rest for we have pledged that we shall use our weapons only in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
Furthermore, we have made clear to United Nations Security Council what would like to repeat today: If a state has accepted this treaty does not have weapons and is a victim of aggression, or is subject to a threat of aggression, involving nuclear weapons, the United States shall prepared to ask immediate Security Council action to provide assistance in accordance with the Charter.
In welcoming the treaty that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons, I should like to repeat the United States commitment to honor all our obligations under existing treaties of mutual security.
Such agreements have added greatly, we think, to the security of our Nation and the nations with which such agreements exist.
They have created a degree of stability in a sometimes unstable world.
This treaty is a very important security measure.
But it also lays an indispensable foundation:  for expanded cooperation in the peaceful application of nuclear energy;  for additional measures to halt the nuclear arms race.
We will cooperate fully to bring the treaty safeguards into being.
We shall thus help provide the basis of confidence that is necessary for increased cooperation in the peaceful nuclear field.
After the treaty has come into force we will permit the International Atomic Energy Agency to apply its safeguards to all nuclear activities in the United States  excluding only those with direct national security significance.
Thus, the United States is not asking any country to accept any safeguards that we are not willing to accept ourselves.
As the treaty requires, we shall also engage in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials, and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
The needs of the developing nations will be given especially particular attention.
We shall make readily available to the nonnuclear treaty partners the benefits of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes.
And we shall do so without delay and under the treaty's provisions.
Now at this moment of achievement and great hope, I am gratified to be able to report and announce to the world a significant agreement  an agreement that we have actively sought and worked for since January 1964:Agreement has been reached between the Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States to enter in the nearest future into discussions on the limitation and the reduction of both offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and systems of defense against ballistic missiles.
Discussion of this most complex subject will not be easy.
We have no illusions that it will be.
I know the stubborn, patient persistence that it has required to come this far.
We do not underestimate the difficulties that may lie ahead.
I know the fears, the suspicions, and the anxieties that we shall have to overcome.
But we do believe that the same spirit of accommodation that is reflected in the negotiation of the present treaty can bring us to a good and fruitful result.
Man can still shape his destiny in the nuclear age  and learn to live as brothers.
Toward that goal  the day when the world moves out of the night of war into the light of sanity and security  I solemnly pledge the resources, the resolve, and the unrelenting efforts of the people of the United States and their Government.
Good evening, my fellow Americans: I speak to you this evening about very important developments in our search for peace in Vietnam.
We have been engaged in discussions with the North Vietnamese in Paris since last May.
The discussions began after I announced on the evening of March 31st in a television speech to the Nation that the United States  in an effort to get talks started on a settlement of the Vietnam war  had stopped the bombing of North Vietnam in the area where 90 percent of the people live.
When our representatives  Ambassador Harriman and Ambassador Vance  were sent to Paris, they were instructed to insist throughout the discussions that the legitimate elected Government of South Vietnam must take its place in any serious negotiations affecting the future of South Vietnam.
Therefore, our Ambassadors Harriman and Vance made it abundantly clear to the representatives of North Vietnam in the beginning that  as I had indicated on the evening of March 31st  we would stop the bombing of North Vietnamese territory entirely when that would lead to prompt and productive talks, meaning by that talks in which the Government of Vietnam was free to participate.
Our ambassadors also stressed that we could not stop the bombing so long as by doing so we would endanger the lives and the safety of our troops.
For a good many weeks, there was no movement in the talks at all.
The talks appeared to really be deadlocked.
Then a few weeks ago, they entered a new and a very much more hopeful phase.
As we moved ahead, I conducted a series of very intensive discussions with our allies, and with the senior military and diplomatic officers of the United States Government, on the prospects for peace.
The President also briefed our congressional leaders and all of the presidential candidates.
Last Sunday evening, and throughout Monday, we began to get confirmation of the essential understanding that we had been seeking with the North Vietnamese on the critical issues between us for some time.
I spent most of all day Tuesday reviewing every single detail of this matter with our field commander, General Abrams, whom I had ordered home, and who arrived here at the White House at 2:30 in the morning and went into immediate conference with the President and the appropriate members of his Cabinet.
We received General Abrams' judgment and we heard his recommendations at some length.
Now, as a result of all of these developments, I have now ordered that all air, naval, and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam cease as of 8 a.
m.
, Washington time, Friday morning.
I have reached this decision on the basis of the developments in the Paris talks.
And I have reached it in the belief that this action can lead to progress toward a peaceful settlement of the Vietnamese war.
I have already informed the three presidential candidates, as well as the congressional leaders of both the Republican and the Democratic Parties of the reasons that the Government has made this decision.
This decision very closely conforms to the statements that I have made in the past concerning a bombing cessation.
It was on August 19th that the President said: This administration does not intend to move further until it has good reason to believe that the other side intends seriously  seriously  to join us in deescalating the war and moving seriously toward peace.
And then again on September 10th, I said: The bombing will not stop until we are confident that it will not lead to an increase in American casualties.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, all military men, have assured me  and General Abrams very firmly asserted to me on Tuesday in that early, 2:30 a.
m.
meeting  that in their military judgment this action should be taken now, and this action would not result in any increase in American casualties.
A regular session of the Paris talks is going to take place next Wednesday, November 6th, at which the representatives of the Government of South Vietnam are free to participate.
We are informed by the representatives of the Hanoi Government that the representatives of the National Liberation Front will also be present.
I emphasize that their attendance in no way involves recognition of the National Liberation Front in any form.
Yet, it conforms to the statements that we have made many times over the years that the NLF would have no difficulty making its views known.
But what we now expect  what we have a right to expect  are prompt, productive, serious, and intensive negotiations in an atmosphere that is conducive to progress.
We have reached the stage where productive talks can begin.
We have made clear to the other side that such talks cannot continue if they take military advantage of them.
We cannot have productive talks in an atmosphere where the cities are being shelled and where the demilitarized zone is being abused.
I think I should caution you, my fellow Americans, that arrangements of this kind are never foolproof.
For that matter, even formal treaties are never foolproof, as we have learned from our experience.
But in the light of the progress that has been made in recent weeks, and after carefully considering and weighing the unanimous military and diplomatic advice and judgment rendered to the Commander in Chief, I have finally decided to take this step now and to really determine the good faith of those who have assured us that progress will result when bombing ceases and to try to ascertain if an early peace is possible.
The overriding consideration that governs us at this hour is the chance and the opportunity that we might have to save human lives, save human lives on both sides of the conflict.
Therefore, I have concluded that we should see if they are acting in good faith.
We could be misled  and we are prepared for such a contingency.
We pray God it does not occur.
But it should be clear to all of us that the new phase of negotiations which opens on November 6th does not  repeat, does not  mean that a stable peace has yet come to Southeast Asia.
There may well be very hard fighting ahead.
Certainly, there is going to be some very hard negotiating, because many difficult and critically important issues are still facing these negotiators.
But I hope and I believe that with good will we can solve them.
We know that negotiations can move swiftly if the common intent of the negotiators is peace in the world.
The world should know that the American people bitterly remember the long, agonizing Korean negotiations of 1951 through 1953  and that our people will just not accept deliberate delay and prolonged procrastination again.
Well then, how has it come about that now, on November 1st, we have agreed to stop the bombardment of North Vietnam? I would have given all I possess if the conditions had permitted me to stop it months ago; if there had just been any movement in the Paris talks that would have justified me in saying to you, Now it can be safely stopped.
But I, the President of the United States, do not control the timing of the events in Hanoi.
The decisions in Hanoi really determine when and whether it would be possible for us to stop the bombing.
We could not retract our insistence on the participation of the Government of South Vietnam in serious talks affecting the future of their people  the people of South Vietnam.
For though we have allied with South Vietnam for many years in this struggle, we have never assumed and we shall never demand the role of dictating the future of the people of South Vietnam.
The very principle for which we are engaged in South Vietnam  the principle of self-determination  requires that the South Vietnamese people themselves be permitted to freely speak for themselves at the Paris talks and that the South Vietnamese delegation play a leading role in accordance with our agreement with President Thieu at Honolulu.
It was made just as clear to North Vietnam that a total bombing halt must not risk the lives of our men.
When I spoke last March 31st, I said that evening: Whether a complete bombing halt becomes possible in the future will be determined by events.
Well, I cannot tell you tonight specifically in all detail why there has been progress in Paris.
But I can tell you that a series of hopeful events has occurred in South Vietnam:  The Government of South Vietnam has grown steadily stronger.
South Vietnam's Armed Forces have been substantially increased to the point where a million men are tonight under arms, and the effectiveness of these men has steadily improved.
The superb performance of our own men, under the brilliant leadership of General Westmoreland and General Abrams, has produced truly remarkable results.
Now, perhaps some or all of these factors played a part in bringing about progress in the talks.
And when at last progress did come, I believe that my responsibilities to the brave men  our men  who bear the burden of battle in South Vietnam tonight, and my duty to seek an honorable settlement of the war, required me to recognize and required me to act without delay.
I have acted tonight.
There have been many long days of waiting for new steps toward peace  days that began in hope, only to end at night in disappointment.
Constancy to our national purpose  which is to seek the basis for a durable peace in Southeast Asia  has sustained me in all of these hours when there seemed to be no progress whatever in these talks.
But now that progress has come, I know that your prayers are joined with mine and with those of all humanity, that the action I announce tonight will be a major step toward a firm and an honorable peace in Southeast Asia.
It can be.
So, what is required of us in these new circumstances is exactly that steady determination and patience which has brought us to this more hopeful prospect.
What is required of us is a courage and a steadfastness, and a perseverance here at home, that will match that of our men who fight for us tonight in Vietnam.
So, I ask you not only for your prayers but for the courageous and understanding support that Americans always give their President and their leader in an hour of trial.
With that understanding, and with that support, we shall not fail.
Seven months ago I said that I would not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that were then developing in this political year.
Accordingly, on the night of March 31st, I announced that I would not seek nor accept the nomination of my party for another term as President.
I have devoted every resource of the Presidency to the search for peace in Southeast Asia.
Throughout the entire summer and fall I have kept all of the presidential candidates fully briefed on developments in Paris as well as in Vietnam.
I have made it abundantly clear that no one candidate would have the advantage over others  either in information about those developments, or in advance notice of the policy the Government intended to follow.
The chief diplomatic and military officers of this Government all were instructed to follow the same course.
Since that night on March 31st, each of the candidates has had differing ideas about the Government's policy.
But generally speaking, however, throughout the campaign we have been able to present a united voice supporting our Government and supporting our men in Vietnam.
I hope, and I believe, that this can continue until January 20th of next year when a new President takes office.
Because in this critical hour, we just simply cannot afford more than one voice speaking for our Nation in the search for peace.
I do not know who will be inaugurated as the 37th President of the United States next January.
But I do know that I shall do all that I can in the next few months to try to lighten his burdens as the contributions of the Presidents who preceded me have greatly lightened mine.
I shall do everything in my power to move us toward the peace that the new President  as well as this President and, I believe, every other American  so deeply and urgently desires.
Thank you for listening.
Good night and God bless all of you.
Speaker,  President, Members of the Congress and my fellow AmericansFor the sixth and the last time, I present to the Congress my assessment of the State of the Union.
I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunityand about the commitments that all of us have made together that will, if we carry them out, give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want.
Every President lives, not only with what is, but with what has been and what could be.
Most of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence extending back through several years and extending back through several other administrations.
Urban unrest, poverty, pressures on welfare, education of our people, law enforcement and law and order, the continuing crisis in the Middle East, the conflict in Vietnam, the dangers of nuclear war, the great difficulties of dealing with the Communist powers, all have this much in common: They and their causesthe causes that gave rise to themall of these have existed with us for many years.
Several Presidents have already sought to try to deal with them.
One or more Presidents will try to resolve them or try to contain them in the years that are ahead of us.
But if the Nation's problems are continuing, so are this great Nation's assets:our economy,the democratic system,our sense of exploration, symbolized most recently by the wonderful flight of the Apollo 8, in which all Americans took great pride,the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people, andtheir essential love of justice.
We must not ignore our problems.
But neither should we ignore our strengths.
Those strengths are available to sustain a President of either partyto support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas.
Unfortunately, the departure of an administration does not mean the end of the problems that this administration has faced.
The effort to meet the problems must go on, year after year, if the momentum that we have all mounted together in these past years is not to be lost.
Although the struggle for progressive change is continuous, there are times when a watershed is reachedwhen there isif not really a break with the pastat least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes, and a stepping forth into a new environment, to seek new goals.
I think the past 5 years have been such a time.
We have finished a major part of the old agenda.
Some of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken on the flesh of achievement.
Medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of American life.
Voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the riffles, and the doors to public service, are open at last to all Americans regardless of their color.
Schools and school children all over America tonight are receiving federal assistance to go to good schools.
Preschool educationHead Startis already here to stay and, I think, so are the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities of this country.
Part of the American earthnot only in description on a map, but in the reality of our shores, our hills, our parks, our forests, and our mountainshas been permanently set aside for the American public and for their benefit.
And there is more that will be set aside before this administration ends.
Five million Americans have been trained for jobs in new federal programs.
I think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this Nation is close to full employmentwith less unemployment than we have had at any time in almost 20 years.
That is not in theory; that is in fact.
Tonight, the unemployment rate is down to 3.
3 percent.
The number of jobs has grown more than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 years.
That is more than in all the preceding 12 years.
These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and, finally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.
I wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and the administration achieved during this period had already completed that cycle.
But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding to become a tangible realization.
Yet the very existence of these commitmentsthese promises to the American people, made by this Congress and by the executive branch of the Governmentare achievements in themselves, and failure to carry through on our commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation.
This much is certain: No one man or group of men made these commitments alone.
Congress and the executive branch, with their checks and balances, reasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land.
They now have all the moral force that the American political system can summon when it acts as one.
They express America's common determination to achieve goals.
They imply action.
In most cases, you have already begun that actionbut it is not fully completed, of course.
Let me speak for a moment about these commitments.
I am going to speak in the language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these measures.
I am going to quote from your words.
In 1966, Congress declared that improving the quality of urban life is the most critical domestic problem facing the United States.
Two years later it affirmed the historic goal of a decent home.
for every American family.
That is your language.
Now to meet these commitments, we must increase our support for the model cities program, where blueprints of change are already being prepared in more than 150 American citiesTo achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already passed, we should begin this year more than 500,000 homes for needy families in the coming fiscal year.
Funds are provided in the new budget to do just this.
This is almost 10 times10 timesthe average rate of the past 10 years.
Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of their growing populations.
So I believe an urban development bank should be created by the Congress.
This bank could obtain resources through the issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced rates to the communities throughout the land for schools, hospitals, parks, and other public facilities.
Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935, Congress has recognized the necessity to make more adequate provision for aged persons.
through maternal and child welfare.
and public health.
Those are the words of the Congressmore adequate.
The time has come, I think, to make it more adequate.
I believe we should increase social security benefits, and I am so recommending tonight.
I am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at least 13 percent.
Those who receive only the minimum of $55 should get $80 a month.
Our Nation, too, is rightfully proud of our medical advances.
But we should remember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its infant mortality rate.
I think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their children during the first year of their life in the United States of America.
I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of catastrophic illness.
As we pass on from medicine, I think nothing is clearer to the Congress than the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty.
Congress expressed it well, I think, in 1964, when they said: It is the policy of the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation.
This is the richest nation in the world.
The antipoverty program has had many achievements.
It also has some failures.
But we must not cripple it after only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been with us and have been building up among us for generations.
I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to other agencies.
I believe, though, it will want to continue, until we have broken the back of poverty, the efforts we are now making throughout this land.
I believe, and I hope the next administrationI believe they believethat the key to success in this effort is jobs.
It is work for people who want to work.
In the budget for fiscal 1970, I shall recommend a total of $3.
5 billion for our job training program, and that is five times as much as we spent in 1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their own living.
The Nation's commitment in the field of civil rights began with the Declaration of Independence.
They were extended by the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments.
They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of three far-reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years, that this Congress, in its wisdom, passed.
On January 1 of this year, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20 million American homes and apartments.
The prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously enforced throughout this land.
I believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting Rights Act for another 5 years.
In the Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress determined To assist state and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime.
This year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full $300 million that the Congress last year authorized to do just that.
I hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is.
I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the United States.
I hope these grants can be made to the States and they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country.
But all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be madeI think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nationif we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest.
Frankly, as I leave the Office of the Presidency, one of my greatest disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearms.
I think if we had passed that act, it would have reduced the incidence of crime.
I believe that the Congress should adopt such a law, and I hope that it will at a not too distant date.
In order to meet our long-standing commitment to make government as efficient as possible, I believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the lines of the Kappel report.
I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve their country.
I believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound.
Later this week, I shall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership this evening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the Commission's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries.
For Members of Congress, I will recommend the basic compensation not of the $50,000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the other distinguished Members, but I shall reduce that $50,000 to $42,500.
I will suggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expenses, so that Members will not be required to use their salary increase for essential official business.
I would have submitted the Commission's recommendations, except the advice that I received from the leadershipand you usually are consulted about matters that affect the Congresswas that the Congress would not accept the $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my recommendation to be seriously considered, I should make substantial reductions.
That is the only reason I did not go along with the Kappel report.
In 1967 1 recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft.
I submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration.
I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all of these commitments I talk about will cost money.
If we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8 years, I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these commitments.
We have already been able to increase our support for major social programsalthough we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything on the home front because of Vietnam; but we have been able in the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education from $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming fiscal year.
That is more than double.
That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188 years of this Republic, notwithstanding Vietnam.
We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.
Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January when we made our estimates.
At that time, you will remember that we estimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion.
Well, I am glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this June, we are going to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a $2.
4 billion surplus.
You will receive the budget tomorrow.
The budget for the next fiscal year, that begins July 1which you will want to examine very carefully in the days aheadwill provide a $3.
4 billion surplus.
This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted last year.
I have communicated with the President-elect,  Nixon, in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being.
I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as circumstances will permit, but the President-elect has told me that he has concluded that until his administration, and this Congress, can examine the appropriation bills, and each item in the budget, and can ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced, he,  Nixon, will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued.
Americans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will bring an early peace to Vietnam.
And if our hopes for an early settlement of the war are realized, then our military expenditures can be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable purposes, as the Congress may determine.
In any event, I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity.
I think all Americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep, and it has brought record profits, the highest in our history, and record wages.
Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our Nation's history.
Our wages have been the highest.
Our profits have been the best.
This prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years.
I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have achieved a surplus.
It appears that we have, in fact, done better this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957.
The quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every administration since the end of World War II It has required us to seek a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers, but among the smaller nations as well.
We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963, the outer space treaty of 1967, and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968.
This latter agreementthe nonproliferation treatyis now pending in the Senate and it has been pending there since last July.
In my opinion, delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace.
America took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date.
Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the superpowers, mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension.
So, I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet Union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems.
I think they would already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election this year.
It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to aid the developing nations.
We knew then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.
During these years there have been great advances made under our program, particularly against want and hunger, although we are disappointed at the appropriations last year.
We thought they were woefully inadequate.
This year I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world.
I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation.
Among those efforts, that of Western Europe has a very special place in America's concern.
The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity.
I think America remains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner on the basis of equality.
For the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires:that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become the leading nation in world trade,that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity, andthat we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served.
The strained relationship between us and the world's leading Communist power has not endedespecially in the light of the brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia.
But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world catastrophe.
What we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world.
We earnestly hope that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and individual freedom.
The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam, and in the Paris talks.
I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam.
The prospects, I think, for peace are better today than at any time since North Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years ago.
The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time: that America cares about their freedom, and it also cares about America's own vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific.
The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purposes by force.
There may be hard fighting before a settlement is reached; but, I can assure you, it will yield no victory to the Communist cause.
I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us.
I have been honored to be their Commander in Chief.
The Nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continuesand its enduring gratitude when their service is done.
Finally, the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many capitals tonight.
America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the U.
N.
Security Council which points the way.
There must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today.
It is a threat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States, but it is a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well.
Now, my friends in Congress, I want to conclude with a few very personal words to you.
I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional leadership's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight.
I did that for two reasons.
One was philosophical.
I wanted to give you my judgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I view them, before I leave.
The other was just pure sentimental.
Most all of my life as a public official has been spent here in this building.
For 38 years-since I worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of RepresentativesI have known these halls, and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked them.
I know the questions that you face.
I know the conflicts that you endure.
I know the ideals that you seek to serve.
I left here first to become Vice President, and then to become, in a moment of tragedy, the President of the United States.
My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges, both at home and throughout the world.
In meeting some of these challenges, the Nation has found a new confidence.
In meeting others, it knew turbulence and doubt, and fear and hate.
Throughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in representative democracya faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator.
I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nationdescribed by the Constitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow citizens.
Now for five most demanding years in the White House, I have been strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents, Harry S.
Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower.
I have been guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved John F.
Kennedy, and with our greatest modern legislator, Speaker Sam Rayburn.
I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way, Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the loyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert.
I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield, and I am sure that I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel of the President Pro Tem of the Senate, Senator Richard Brevard Russell.
I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, Senator Dirksen and Congressman Gerald Ford, the Minority Leader.
No President should ask for more, although I did upon occasions.
But few Presidents have ever been blessed with so much.
President-elect Nixon, in the days ahead, is going to need your understanding, just as I did.
And he is entitled to have it.
I hope every Member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President, will be borne for all of us.
Each of us should try not to increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage.
Now, it is time to leave.
I hope it may be said, a hundred years from now, that by working together we helped to make our country more just, more just for all of its people, as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for all of our posterity.
That is what I hope.
But I believe that at least it will be said that we tried.
Speaker,  President, Members of the Congress and my fellow Americans: For the sixth and the last time, I present to the Congress my assessment of the State of the Union.
I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunityand about the commitments that all of us have made together that will, if we carry them out, give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want.

I will suggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expenses, so that Members will not be required to use their salary increase for essential official business.
I would have submitted the Commission's recommendations, except the advice that I received from the leadershipand you usually are consulted about matters that affect the Congresswas that the Congress would not accept the $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my recommendation to be seriously considered, I should make substantial reductions.
That is the only reason I did not go along with the Kappel report.
In 1967 1 recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft.
I submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration.
I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all of these commitments I talk about will cost money.
If we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8 years, I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these commitments.
We have already been able to increase our support for major social programsalthough we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything on the home front because of Vietnam; but we have been able in the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education from $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming fiscal year.
That is more than double.
That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188 years of this Republic, notwithstanding Vietnam.
We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.
Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January when we made our estimates.
At that time, you will remember that we estimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion.
Well, I am glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this June, we are going to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a $2.
4 billion surplus.
You will receive the budget tomorrow.
The budget for the next fiscal year, that begins July 1which you will want to examine very carefully in the days aheadwill provide a $3.
4 billion surplus.
This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted last year.
I have communicated with the President-elect,  Nixon, in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being.
I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as circumstances will permit, but the President-elect has told me that he has concluded that until his administration, and this Congress, can examine the appropriation bills, and each item in the budget, and can ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced, he,  Nixon, will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued.
Americans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will bring an early peace to Vietnam.
And if our hopes for an early settlement of the war are realized, then our military expenditures can be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable purposes, as the Congress may determine.
In any event, I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity.
I think all Americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep, and it has brought record profits, the highest in our history, and record wages.
Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our Nation's history.
Our wages have been the highest.
Our profits have been the best.
This prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years.
I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have achieved a surplus.
It appears that we have, in fact, done better this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957.
The quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every administration since the end of World War II It has required us to seek a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers, but among the smaller nations as well.
We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963, the outer space treaty of 1967, and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968.
This latter agreementthe nonproliferation treatyis now pending in the Senate and it has been pending there since last July.
In my opinion, delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace.
America took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date.
Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the superpowers, mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension.
So, I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet Union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems.
I think they would already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election this year.
It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to aid the developing nations.
We knew then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.
During these years there have been great advances made under our program, particularly against want and hunger, although we are disappointed at the appropriations last year.
We thought they were woefully inadequate.
This year I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world.
I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation.
Among those efforts, that of Western Europe has a very special place in America's concern.
The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity.
I think America remains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner on the basis of equality.
For the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires:that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become the leading nation in world trade,that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity, andthat we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served.
The strained relationship between us and the world's leading Communist power has not endedespecially in the light of the brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia.
But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world catastrophe.
What we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world.
We earnestly hope that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and individual freedom.
The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam, and in the Paris talks.
I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam.
The prospects, I think, for peace are better today than at any time since North Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years ago.
The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time: that America cares about their freedom, and it also cares about America's own vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific.
The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purposes by force.
There may be hard fighting before a settlement is reached; but, I can assure you, it will yield no victory to the Communist cause.
I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us.
I have been honored to be their Commander in Chief.
The Nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continuesand its enduring gratitude when their service is done.
Finally, the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many capitals tonight.
America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the U.
N.
Security Council which points the way.
There must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today.
It is a threat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States, but it is a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well.
Now, my friends in Congress, I want to conclude with a few very personal words to you.
I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional leadership's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight.
I did that for two reasons.
One was philosophical.
I wanted to give you my judgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I view them, before I leave.
The other was just pure sentimental.
Most all of my life as a public official has been spent here in this building.
For 38 years-since I worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of RepresentativesI have known these halls, and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked them.
I know the questions that you face.
I know the conflicts that you endure.
I know the ideals that you seek to serve.
I left here first to become Vice President, and then to become, in a moment of tragedy, the President of the United States.
My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges, both at home and throughout the world.
In meeting some of these challenges, the Nation has found a new confidence.
In meeting others, it knew turbulence and doubt, and fear and hate.
Throughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in representative democracya faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator.
I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nationdescribed by the Constitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow citizens.
Now for five most demanding years in the White House, I have been strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents, Harry S.
Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower.
I have been guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved John F.
Kennedy, and with our greatest modern legislator, Speaker Sam Rayburn.
I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way, Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the loyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert.
I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield, and I am sure that I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel of the President Pro Tem of the Senate, Senator Richard Brevard Russell.
I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, Senator Dirksen and Congressman Gerald Ford, the Minority Leader.
No President should ask for more, although I did upon occasions.
But few Presidents have ever been blessed with so much.
President-elect Nixon, in the days ahead, is going to need your understanding, just as I did.
And he is entitled to have it.
I hope every Member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President, will be borne for all of us.
Each of us should try not to increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage.
Now, it is time to leave.
I hope it may be said, a hundred years from now, that by working together we helped to make our country more just, more just for all of its people, as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for all of our posterity.
That is what I hope.
But I believe that at least it will be said that we tried.
