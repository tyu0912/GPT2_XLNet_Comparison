, at least so far as their own countries were concerned,, p.<entry>56.87182744932335<new_line>367 advanced money rates very rapidly in practically every European country in order to attract capital that had drifted from Europe into New York , back into their own industry and commerce.<entry>Incidentally , the effect of increasing discount rates in Europe is much greater on their business structure than it is with us.<entry>The capital was not there for the first time, but it was there for a long time.<entry>85.95812704859289<new_line>Incidentally , the effect of increasing discount rates in Europe is much greater on their business structure than it is with us.<entry>Our business structure is not so sensitive to interest rates as theirs is.<entry>The reason why we have to pay higher rates is because of the fact that we are not doing our part to help the poor.<entry>56.35108128233838<new_line>Our business structure is not so sensitive to interest rates as theirs is.<entry>So their sharp advancement of discount rates tended to affect this market , and probably expedited or even started this movement.<entry>We have no interest in the interest rate on the debt," he said.<entry>185.5707768411757<new_line>So their sharp advancement of discount rates tended to affect this market , and probably expedited or even started this movement.<entry>But once the movement has taken place we have a number of phenomena that rapidly develop.<entry>The market for the new products was already very large and growing rapidly, and the price of the old products had been declining.<entry>150.9530297416611<new_line>But once the movement has taken place we have a number of phenomena that rapidly develop.<entry>The first is that the domestic banks in the interior of the

changes of their lives.<entry>63.202189191995735<new_line>The first is that the domestic banks in the interior of the United States , and corporations , withdraw their money from the call

the domestic banks in the United States, and corporations, withdraw their money from the call market.<entry>32.797354683474566<new_line>There has been a very great movement out of New York into the interior of the United States , as well as some movement out of New York into foreign countries.<entry>The incidental result of that is to create a difficult situation in New York , but also to increase the available capital in the interior.<entry>The American people have been very receptive to the idea that the United States can be the world's leading democracy, and that it is a great country.<entry>25.612429345694355<new_line>The incidental result of that is to create a difficult situation in New York , but also to increase the available capital in the interior.<entry>In the interior there has been , in consequence , a tendency for interest rates to fall at once because of the unemployed capital brought back into interior points.<entry>The result is that the city will be unable to afford the capital needed to maintain its existing infrastructure.<entry>81.22150730738963<new_line>In the interior there has been , in consequence , a tendency for interest rates to fall at once because of the unemployed capital brought back into interior points.<entry>Perhaps the situation might be clearer on account of its parallel with the last very great crisis , 1907 1908.<entry>The unemployment rate is therefore not as high as the rate of interest rate depreciation.<entry>141.15393551056064<new_line>Perhaps the situation might be clearer on account of its parallel with the last very great crisis , 1907 1908.<entry>In that crash the same drain of money immediately took place into the interior.<entry>The situation is not so much that the government is in crisis as that it is in crisis.<entry>158.24351403372543<new_line>In that crash the same drain of money immediately took place into the interior.<entry>In that case there was no Federal Reserve System.<entry>The car was then towed away.<entry>114.7927466861661<new_line>In that case there was no Federal Reserve System.<entry>There was no way to acquaint of capital movement over the country , and the interest rates ran up to 300 percent.<entry>The Fed was created by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and the Federal Reserve System was created by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.<entry>88.93535823324217<new_line>There was no way to acquaint of capital movement over the country , and the interest rates ran up to 300 percent.<entry>The result was to bring about a monetary panic in the entire country.<entry>The government was forced to raise the interest rates, and the government's share in the debt was reduced by a third.<entry>72.13973371790449<new_line>The result was to bring about a monetary panic in the entire country.<entry>Here with the Federal Reserve System and the activity of the Board , and the ability with which the situation has been handled , there has been a complete isolation of the stock

in New York , has made ample capital available for the call market in substitution of the withdrawals.<entry>This has resulted in a general fall of interest rates , not only in the interior , but also in New York , as witness the reduction of the discount rate.<entry>The call market has also been able to provide liquidity for the financial markets by providing liquidity to the banks and other financial institutions.<entry>58.9342100401044<new_line>This has resulted in a general fall of interest rates , not only in the interior , but also in New York , as witness the reduction of the

interest rates in the US and the UK has been accompanied by a decline in investment in the UK and in the US.<entry>77.02140029693018<new_line>So that instead of having a panic rise in interest rates with monetary rise following it , we have exactly the reverse phenomenon we have a fallen interest p.<entry>368 rate.<entry>The problem with this theory is that it assumes that the Fed will not have

world is functioning entirely normal and rather more easily today than it was 2 weeks ago , because interest rates are less and there is more capital available.<entry>The stock market is a phenomenon that is not confined to the stock market.<entry>53.37759051246251<new_line>In other words , the financial world is functioning entirely normal and rather more easily today than it was 2 weeks ago , because interest rates are less and there is more capital available.<entry>The effect on production is purely psychological.<entry>But the real problem is that there is a very big gap between the financial world and the rest of the world.<entry>62.39831339942861<new_line>The effect on production is purely psychological.<entry>So far there might be said to be from such a shock some tendency on

things would be that with a large release of capital from the speculative market there will be more capital available for the bond and mortgage market.<entry>That market has been practically starved for the last 4 or 5 months.<entry>The fact that the market has been able to hold the price of the bonds and mortgage market at the same time, as well as the fact that the price has risen in the past year, means that there is a greater chance that a large number of investors are going to be buying the bonds.<entry>44.60342074951191<new_line>That market has been practically starved for the last 4
