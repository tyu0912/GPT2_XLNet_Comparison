To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. | And thanks also to all of you on your political staff, as well as your Senators, who have put their hearts and minds into the effort to make this campaign of personal responsibility and democracy a reality.
Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest  a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton. | There will be those who will try to protect, at best, and perpetuate the war on terror; and there will be those who will make America great again; and we will be reunited.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. | Thank you, all.
I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night. | The real Dave Hoar is still there and still looking forward to his journey.
To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia  I love you so much, and I am so proud of all of you. | I wish you all the best in your future lives.
