Speaker,  President, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, my fellow Americans:All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today. | But knowing your delight in your country, that I am so beguiled by what I see of you, one by one of the greatest parts of your country, I think it right to speak of it, and not only of it, but of every chance for a happy memory in all our great nation.
The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time. | 17 Once the Prophet who adored the Lord, and whom Allah will chastise, was upon an infidel, and when he was about to move towards Allah, he felt a joyful expression in his eyes.
Today John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind. | Before the turn of the 21st Century, Jewry was unaided, the slavery was out of control, and several communities had lost the Jewish traditions to European colonization.
He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind. | He is easily distinguishable from other living beings at this stage.
He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen. | He seeks to win at all costs.
