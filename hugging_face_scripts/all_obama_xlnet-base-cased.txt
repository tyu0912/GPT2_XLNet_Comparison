Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest  a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton. | Her legacy and spirit are our greatest strength.
To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. | Thanks for the 10-day meeting that focused on real issues.
I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night. | A man who works and lives his life at home, proud of his wife, and convinced of the beauty and delight that his children will bring to his family.
To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia  I love you so much, and I am so proud of all of you. | I wish you all the best to your political future.
