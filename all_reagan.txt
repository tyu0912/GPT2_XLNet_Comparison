<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mrs</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss>Vice <PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss>Vice <PERSON>-to-be, the distinguished guests here, you ladies and gentlemen</ss>
<ss>I was going to say fellow <NORP> here but those who are watching from a distance, all those millions of <NORP> and independents who I know are looking for a cause around which to rally and which I believe we can give them</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, before you arrive <TIME>, these wonderful people, here, when we came in, gave <PERSON> and myself a welcome</ss>
<ss>That, plus this, plus your kindness and generosity in honoring us by bringing us down here will give us a memory that will live in our hearts forever</ss>
<ss>Watching on television these last few nights I've seen also the warmth with which you greeted <PERSON> and you also filled my heart with joy when you did that</ss>
<ss>May I say some words</ss>
<ss>There are cynics who say that a party platform is something that no one bothers to read and is doesn't very often amount to much</ss>
<ss>Whether it is different this time than is has ever been before, I believe the <NORP> party has a platform that is a banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades</ss>
<ss>We have just heard a call to arms, based on that platform</ss>
<ss>And a call to us to really be successful in communicating and reveal to the <NORP> people the difference between this platform and the platform of the opposing party which is nothing but a revamp and a reissue and a rerunning of a late, late show of the thing that we have been hearing from them for <DATE></ss>
<ss>If I could just take a moment, I had an assignment <DATE></ss>
<ss>Someone asked me to write a letter for a time capsule that is going to opened in Los Angeles <DATE>, on our Tricentennial</ss>
<ss>It sounded like an easy assignment</ss>
<ss>They suggested I write about the problems and issues of <DATE></ss>
<ss>And I set out to do so, riding down the coast in an automobile, looking at <LOC> out on one side and <FAC> on the other, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was going to be that beautiful <DATE> as it was on <DATE></ss>
<ss>And then as I tried to write-let your own minds turn to that task</ss>
<ss>You're going to write for people <DATE> who know all about us, we know nothing about them</ss>
<ss>We don't know what kind of world they'll be living in</ss>
<ss>And suddenly I thought to myself, "If I write of the problems, they'll be the domestic problems of which the <PERSON> spoke here <TIME>; the challenges confronting us, the erosion of freedom taken place under <NORP> rule in this country, the invasion of private rights, the controls and restrictions on the vitality of the great free economy that we enjoy</ss>
<ss>" These are the challenges that we must meet and then again there is that challenge of which he spoke that we live in a world in which the great powers have aimed and poised at each other horrible missiles of destruction, nuclear weapons that can in a matter of <TIME> arrive at each other's country and destroy virtually the civilized world we live in</ss>
<ss>And suddenly it dawned on me; those who would read this letter <DATE> will know whether those missiles were fired</ss>
<ss>They will know whether we met our challenge</ss>
<ss>Whether they will have the freedom that we have known up until now will depend on what we do here</ss>
<ss>Will they look back with appreciation and say, "Thank God for those people in <DATE> who headed off that loss of freedom? Who kept us now <DATE> free? Who kept our world from nuclear destruction?" And if we fail they probably won't get to read the letter at all because it spoke of individual freedom and they won't be allowed to talk of that or read of it</ss>
<ss>This is our challenge and this is why we're here in this hall <TIME></ss>
<ss>Better than we've ever done before, we've got to quit talking to each other and about each other and go out and communicate to the world that we may be fewer in numbers than we've ever been but we carry the message they're waiting for</ss>
<ss>We must go forth from here united, determined and what a great general said <DATE> is true: "There is no substitute for victory</ss>
<ss>" Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Good <TIME></ss>
<ss>I am here <TIME> to announce my intention to seek the <NORP> nomination for President of the United States</ss>
<ss>I'm sure that each of us has seen our country from a number of viewpoints depending on where we've lived and what we've done</ss>
<ss>For me it has been as a boy growing up in several small towns in Illinois</ss>
<ss>As a young man in Iowa trying to get a start in <DATE> of the great depression and later in California for most of my adult life</ss>
<ss>I've seen America from the stadium press box as a sportscaster, as an actor, officer of my labor union, soldier, officeholder and as both <NORP> and <NORP></ss>
<ss>I've lived in an America where those who often had too little to eat outnumbered those who had enough</ss>
<ss>There have been four wars in my lifetime and I've seen our country face financial ruin in depression</ss>
<ss>I have also seen the great strength of this nation as it pulled itself up from that ruin to become the dominant force in the world</ss>
<ss>To me our country is a living, breathing presence, unimpressed by what others say is impossible, proud of its own success, generous, yes and na&iuml;ve, sometimes wrong, never mean and always impatient to provide a better life for its people in a framework of a basic fairness and freedom</ss>
<ss>Someone once said that the difference between an <NORP> and any other kind of person is that an <NORP> lives in anticipation of the future because he knows it will be a great place</ss>
<ss>Other people fear the future as just a repetition of past failures</ss>
<ss>There's a lot of truth in that</ss>
<ss>If there is one thing we are sure of it is that history need not be relived; that nothing is impossible, and that man is capable of improving his circumstances beyond what we are told is fact</ss>
<ss>There are those in our land <DATE>, however, who would have us believe that the United States, like other great civilizations of the past, has reached the zenith of its power; that we are weak and fearful, reduced to bickering with each other and no longer possessed of the will to cope with our problems</ss>
<ss>Much of this talk has come from leaders who claim that our problems are too difficult to handle</ss>
<ss>We are supposed to meekly accept their failures as the most which humanly can be done</ss>
<ss>They tell us we must learn to live with less, and teach our children that their lives will be less full and prosperous than ours have been; that <LOC> will be a place where -- because of our past excesses -- it will be impossible to dream and make those dreams come true</ss>
<ss>I don't believe that</ss>
<ss>And, I don't believe you do either</ss>
<ss>That is why I am seeking the presidency</ss>
<ss>I cannot and will not stand by and see this great country destroy itself</ss>
<ss>Our leaders attempt to blame their failures on circumstances beyond their control, on false estimates by unknown, unidentifiable experts who rewrite modern history in an attempt to convince us our high standard of living, the result of thrift and hard work, is somehow selfish extravagance which we must renounce as we join in sharing scarcity</ss>
<ss>I don't agree that our nation must resign itself to inevitable decline, yielding its proud position to other hands</ss>
<ss>I am totally unwilling to see this country fail in its obligation to itself and to the other free peoples of the world</ss>
<ss>The crisis we face is not the result of any failure of the <NORP> spirit; it is a failure of our leaders to establish rational goals and give our people something to order their lives by</ss>
<ss>If I am elected, I shall regard my election as proof that the people of the United States have decided to set a new agenda and have recognized that the human spirit thrives best when goals are set and progress can be measured in their achievement</ss>
<ss>During <DATE> I shall discuss in detail a wide variety of problems which a new administration must address</ss>
<ss><TIME> I shall mention only a few</ss>
<ss>No problem that we face <DATE> can compare with the need to restore the health of the <NORP> economy and the strength of the <NORP> dollar</ss>
<ss>Double-digit inflation has robbed you and your family of the ability to plan</ss>
<ss>It has destroyed the confidence to buy and it threatens the very structure of family life itself as more and more wives are forced to work in order to help meet the ever-increasing cost of living</ss>
<ss>At the same time, the lack of year growth in the economy has introduced the justifiable fear in the minds of working men and women who are already over extended that soon there will be fewer jobs and no money to pay for even the necessities of life</ss>
<ss>And tragically as the cost of living keeps going up, the standard of living which has been our great pride keeps going down</ss>
<ss>The people have not created this disaster in our economy; the federal government has</ss>
<ss>It has overspent, overestimated, and over regulated</ss>
<ss>It has failed to deliver services within the revenues it should be allowed to raise from taxes</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> since the end of <EVENT>, it has spent <MONEY> more than it has collection in taxes -- <MONEY> of printing press money, which has made every dollar you earn worth less and less</ss>
<ss>At the same time, the federal government has cynically told us that high taxes on business will in some way "solve" the problem and allow the average taxpayer to pay less</ss>
<ss>Well, business is not a taxpayer, it is a tax collector</ss>
<ss>Business has to pass its tax burden on to the customer as part of the cost of doing business</ss>
<ss>You and I pay the taxes imposed on business every time we go to the store</ss>
<ss>Only people pay taxes and it is political demagoguery or economic illiteracy to try and tell us otherwise</ss>
<ss>The key to restoring the health of the economy lies in cutting taxes</ss>
<ss>At the same time, we need to get the waste out of federal spending</ss>
<ss>This does not mean sacrificing essential services, nor do we need to destroy the system of benefits which flow to the poor, the elderly, the sick and the handicapped</ss>
<ss>We have long since committed ourselves, as a people, to help those among us who cannot take care of themselves</ss>
<ss>But the federal government has proven to be the costliest and most inefficient provider of such help we could possibly have</ss>
<ss>We must put an end to the arrogance of a federal establishment which accepts no blame for our condition, cannot be relied upon to give us a fair estimate of our situation and utterly refuses to live within its means</ss>
<ss>I will not accept the supposed "wisdom" which has it that the federal bureaucracy has become so powerful that it can no longer be changed or controlled by any administration</ss>
<ss>As President I would use every power at my command to make the federal establishment respond to the will and the collective wishes of the people</ss>
<ss>We must force the entire federal bureaucracy to live in the real world of reduced spending, streamlined functions and accountability to the people it serves</ss>
<ss>We must review the functions of the federal government to determine which of those are the proper province of levels of government closer to the people</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> article of <LAW> is explicit in pointing out that the federal government should do only those things specifically called for in the <LAW></ss>
<ss>All others shall remain with the states or the people</ss>
<ss>We haven't been observing that <ORDINAL> article of late</ss>
<ss>The federal government has taken on functions it was never intended to perform and which it does not perform well</ss>
<ss>There should be a planned, orderly transfer of such functions to states and communities and a transfer with them of the sources of taxation to pay for them</ss>
<ss>The savings in administrative would be considerable and certainly there would be increased efficiency and less bureaucracy</ss>
<ss>By reducing federal tax rates where they discourage individual initiative -- especially personal income tax rates -- we can restore incentives, invite greater economic growth and at the same time help give us better government instead of bigger government</ss>
<ss>Proposals such as the Kemp-Roth bill would bring about this kind of realistic reductions in tax rates</ss>
<ss>In short, a punitive tax system must be replaced by one that restores incentive for the worker and for industry; a system that rewards initiative and effort and encourages thrift</ss>
<ss>All these things are possible; none of them will be easy</ss>
<ss>But the choice is clear</ss>
<ss>We can go on letting the country slip over the brink to financial ruin with the disaster that it means for the individual or we can find the will to work together to restore confidence in ourselves and to regain the confidence of the world</ss>
<ss>I have lived through one depression</ss>
<ss>I carry with me the memory of a Christmas Eve when my brother and I and our parents exchanged modest gifts -- there was no lighted tree as there had been on <LOC> past</ss>
<ss>I remember watching my father open what he thought was a greeting from his employer</ss>
<ss>We all watched and yes, we were hoping for a bonus check</ss>
<ss>It was notice that he no longer had a job</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE> the government ran radio announcements telling workers not to leave home looking for jobs -- there were no jobs</ss>
<ss>I'll carry with me always the memory of my father sitting there holding that envelope, unable to look at us</ss>
<ss>I cannot and will not stand by while inflation and joblessness destroy the dignity of our people</ss>
<ss>Another serious problem which must be discussed <TIME> is our energy situation</ss>
<ss>Our country was built on cheap energy</ss>
<ss><DATE>, energy is not cheap and we face the prospect that some forms of energy may soon not be available at all</ss>
<ss><DATE> you probably spent <TIME> sitting in gasoline lines</ss>
<ss><DATE>, some will be without heat and everyone will be paying much more simply to keep home and family warm</ss>
<ss>If you ever had any doubt of the government's inability to provide for the needs of the people, just look at the utter fiasco we now call "the energy crisis</ss>
<ss>" Not one straight answer nor any realistic hope of relief has come from the present administration in <DATE> of federal treatment of the problem</ss>
<ss>As gas lines grew, the administration again panicked and now has proposed to put the country on a wartime footing; but for this "war" there is no victory in sight</ss>
<ss>And, as always, when the federal bureaucracy fails, all it can suggest is more of the same</ss>
<ss>This time it's another bureau to untangle the mess made by the ones we already have</ss>
<ss>But, this just won't work</ss>
<ss>Solving the energy crisis will not be easy, but it can be done</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> we must decide that "less" is not enough</ss>
<ss>Next we must remove government obstacles to energy production</ss>
<ss>And, we must make use of those technological advantages we still possess</ss>
<ss>It is no program simply to say "use less energy</ss>
<ss>" Of course waste must be eliminated and efficiency promoted, but not an energy policy</ss>
<ss>At best it means we will run out of energy a little more slowly</ss>
<ss>But a day will come when the lights will dim and the wheels of industry will turn more slowly and finally stop</ss>
<ss>As President I will not endorse any course which has this as its principle objective</ss>
<ss>We need more energy and that means diversifying our sources of supply away from the <ORG> countries</ss>
<ss>Yes, it means more efficient automobiles</ss>
<ss>But it also means more exploration and development of oil and natural gas here in our own country</ss>
<ss>The only way to free ourselves from the monopoly pricing power of <ORG> is to be less dependent on outside sources of fuel</ss>
<ss>The answer obvious to anyone except those in the administration, it seems, is more domestic production of oil and gas</ss>
<ss>We must also have wider use of nuclear power within strict safety rules, of course</ss>
<ss>There must be more spending by the energy industries on research and development of substitutes for fossil fuels</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> to come solar energy may provide much of the answer but for <DATE> we must do such things as master the chemistry of coal</ss>
<ss>Putting the market system to work for these objectives is an essential <ORDINAL> step for their achievement</ss>
<ss>Additional multi-billion dollar federal bureaus and programs are not the answer</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> there has been much talk about "excess" oil company profits</ss>
<ss>I don't believe we've been given all the information we need to make a judgement about this</ss>
<ss>We should have that information</ss>
<ss>Government exists to protect us from each other</ss>
<ss>It is not government's function to allocate fuel or impose unnecessary restrictions on the marketplace</ss>
<ss>It is government's function to determine whether we are being unfairly exploited and if so to take immediate and appropriate action</ss>
<ss>As President I would do exactly that</ss>
<ss>On the foreign front, <DATE> of the <DATE>'s will place severe pressures upon the United States and its allies</ss>
<ss>We can expect to be tested in ways calculated to try our patience, to confound our resolve and to erode our belief in ourselves</ss>
<ss>During a time when the Soviet Union may enjoy nuclear superiority over this country, we must never waiver in our commitment to our allies nor accept any negotiation which is not clearly in the national interest</ss>
<ss>We must judge carefully</ss>
<ss>Though we should leave no initiative untried in our pursuit of peace, we must be clear voiced in our resolve to resist any unpeaceful act wherever it may occur</ss>
<ss>Negotiations with the Soviet Union must never become appeasement</ss>
<ss>For the most of <DATE>, we have been preoccupied with the global struggle -- the competition -- with the Soviet Union and with our responsibilities to our allies</ss>
<ss>But too often in recent times we have just drifted along with events, responding as if we thought of ourselves as a nation in decline</ss>
<ss>To our allies we seem to appear to be a nation unable to make decisions in its own interests, let alone in the common interest</ss>
<ss>Since <EVENT> we have spent large amounts of money and much of our time protecting and defending freedom all over the world</ss>
<ss>We must continue this, for if we do not accept the responsibilities of leadership, who will? And if no one will, how will we survive? The <DATE>'s have taught us the foolhardiness of not having a long-range diplomatic strategy of our own</ss>
<ss>The world has become a place where, in order to survive, our country needs more than just allies -- it needs real friends</ss>
<ss>Yet, in recent times we often seem not to have recognized who our friends are</ss>
<ss>This must change</ss>
<ss>It is now time to take stock of our own house and to resupply its strength</ss>
<ss>Part of that process involves taking stock of our relationship with Puerto Rico</ss>
<ss>I favor statehood for Puerto Rico and if the people of Puerto Rico vote for statehood in their coming referendum I would, as President, initiate the enabling legislation to make this a reality</ss>
<ss>We live on a continent whose three countries possess the assets to make it the strongest, most prosperous and self-sufficient area on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Within the borders of this <NORP> continent are the food, resources, technology and undeveloped territory which, properly managed, could dramatically improve the quality of life of all its inhabitants</ss>
<ss>It is no accident that this unmatched potential for progress and prosperity exists in three countries with such long-standing heritages of free government</ss>
<ss>A developing closeness among Canada, Mexico and the United States -- a <NORP> accord -- would permit achievement of that potential in each country beyond that which I believe any of them -- strong as they are -- could accomplish in the absence of such cooperation</ss>
<ss>In fact, the key to our own future security may lie in both Mexico and Canada becoming much stronger countries than they are <DATE></ss>
<ss>No one can say at this point what form future cooperation among our three countries will take</ss>
<ss>But if I am elected President, I would be willing to invite each of our neighbors to send a special representative to our government to sit in on high level planning sessions with us, as partners, mutually concerned about the future of our Continent</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, I would immediately seek the views and ideas of <NORP> and <NORP> leaders on this issue, and work tirelessly with them to develop closer ties among our peoples</ss>
<ss>It is time we stopped thinking of our nearest neighbors as foreigners</ss>
<ss>By developing methods of working closely together, we will lay the foundations for future cooperation on a broader and more significant scale</ss>
<ss>We will also put to rest any doubts of those cynical enough to believe that the United States would seek to dominate any relationship among our three countries, or foolish enough to think that the governments and peoples of Canada and Mexico would ever permit such domination to occur</ss>
<ss>I, for one, am confident that we can show the world by example that the nations of <LOC> are ready, within the context of an unswerving commitment to freedom, to seek new forms of accommodation to meet a changing world</ss>
<ss>A developing closeness between the United States, Canada and Mexico would serve notice on friend and foe alike that we were prepared for a long haul, looking outward again and confident our of future; that together we are going to create jobs, to generate new fortunes of wealth for many and provide a legacy for the children of each of our countries</ss>
<ss><DATE> we taught the world that a new form of government, created out of the genius of man to cope with his circumstances, could succeed in bringing a measure of quality to human life previously thought impossible</ss>
<ss>Now let us work toward the goal of using the assets of this continent, its resources, technology and foodstuffs in the most efficient ways possible for the common good of all its people</ss>
<ss>It may take <DATE> but we can dare to dream that at some future date a map of the world might show the <NORP> continent as one in which the peoples and commerce of its three strong countries flow more freely across their present borders than they do <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> leaders in our government have told us that, we, the people, have lost confidence in ourselves; that we must regain the spirit and our will to achieve our national goals</ss>
<ss>Well, it is true there is a lack of confidence, an unease with things the way they are</ss>
<ss>But the confidence we have lost is confidence in our government's policies</ss>
<ss>Our unease can almost be called bewilderment at how our defense strength has deteriorated</ss>
<ss>The great productivity of our industry is now surpassed by virtually all the major nations who compete with us for world markets</ss>
<ss>And, our currency is no longer the stable measure of value it once was</ss>
<ss>But there remains the greatness of our people, our capacity for dreaming up fantastic deeds and bringing them off to the surprise of an unbelieving world</ss>
<ss>When Washington's men were freezing at Valley Forge, <PERSON> told his fellow <NORP>: "We have it in our power to begin the world over again</ss>
<ss>" We still have that power</ss>
<ss>We -- <DATE>'s living <NORP> -- have in our lifetime fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this <LOC></ss>
<ss>The citizens of this great nation want leadership -- yes -- but not a "man on a white horse" demanding obedience to his commands</ss>
<ss>They want someone who believes they can "begin the world over again</ss>
<ss>" A leader who will unleash their great strength and remove the roadblocks government has put in their way</ss>
<ss>I want to do that more than anything I've ever wanted</ss>
<ss>And it's something that I believe with <PERSON>'s help I can do</ss>
<ss>I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency; to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege</ss>
<ss>Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded -- religion, education and, above all, family</ss>
<ss>Government cannot be clergyman, teacher and parent</ss>
<ss>It is our servant, beholden to us</ss>
<ss>We who are privileged to be <NORP> have had a rendezvous with destiny since the moment in <DATE> when <PERSON>, standing on the deck of the tiny <PERSON> off the coast of Massachusetts, told the little band of pilgrims, "We shall be as a city upon a hill</ss>
<ss>The eyes of all people are upon us so that if we shall deal falsely with our <PERSON> in this work we have undertaken and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword throughout the world</ss>
<ss>" A troubled and afflicted mankind looks to us, pleading for us to keep our rendezvous with destiny; that we will uphold the principles of self-reliance, self-discipline, morality, and -- above all -- responsible liberty for every individual that we will become that shining city on a hill</ss>
<ss>I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny</ss>
<ss>Thank you and good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss>Vice President to be, this convention, my fellow citizens of this great nation: With a deep awareness of the responsibility conferred by your trust, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</ss>
<ss>I do so with deep gratitude, and I think also I might interject on behalf of all of us, our thanks to Detroit and the people of Michigan and to this city for the warm hospitality they have shown</ss>
<ss>And I thank you for your wholehearted response to my recommendation in regard to <PERSON> as a candidate for vice president</ss>
<ss>I am very proud of our party <TIME></ss>
<ss>This convention has shown to all America a party united, with positive programs for solving the nation's problems; a party ready to build a new consensus with all those across the land who share a community of values embodied in these words: family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>I know we have had a quarrel or two, but only as to the method of attaining a goal</ss>
<ss>There was no argument about the goal</ss>
<ss>As president, I will establish a liaison with the 50 governors to encourage them to eliminate, where it exists, discrimination against women</ss>
<ss>I will monitor federal laws to insure their implementation and to add statutes if they are needed</ss>
<ss>More than anything else, I want my candidacy to unify our country; to renew the <NORP> spirit and sense of purpose</ss>
<ss>I want to carry our message to every <NORP>, regardless of party affiliation, who is a member of this community of shared values</ss>
<ss>Never before in our history have <NORP> been called upon to face three grave threats to our very existence, any one of which could destroy us</ss>
<ss>We face a disintegrating economy, a weakened defense and an energy policy based on the sharing of scarcity</ss>
<ss>The major issue of this campaign is the direct political, personal and moral responsibility of <ORG> leadership --i n <ORG> and in <ORG> -- for this unprecedented calamity which has befallen us</ss>
<ss>They tell us they have done the most that humanly could be done</ss>
<ss>They say that the United States has had its <DATE> in the sun; that our nation has passed its zenith</ss>
<ss>They expect you to tell your children that the <NORP> people no longer have the will to cope with their problems; that the future will be one of sacrifice and few opportunities</ss>
<ss>My fellow citizens, I utterly reject that view</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people, the most generous on earth, who created the highest standard of living, are not going to accept the notion that we can only make a better world for others by moving backwards ourselves</ss>
<ss>Those who believe we can have no business leading the nation</ss>
<ss>I will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself under mediocre leadership that drifts from one crisis to the next, eroding our national will and purpose</ss>
<ss>We have come together here because the <NORP> people deserve better from those to whom they entrust our nation's highest offices, and we stand united in our resolve to do something about it</ss>
<ss>We need rebirth of the <NORP> tradition of leadership at every level of government and in private life as well</ss>
<ss>The United States of America is unique in world history because it has a genius for leaders -- many leaders -- on many levels</ss>
<ss>But, back in <DATE>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said, "Trust me</ss>
<ss>" And a lot of people did</ss>
<ss>Now, many of those people are out of work</ss>
<ss>Many have seen their savings eaten away by inflation</ss>
<ss>Many others on fixed incomes, especially the elderly, have watched helplessly as the cruel tax of inflation wasted away their purchasing power</ss>
<ss>And, <DATE>, a great many who trusted Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> wonder if we can survive the <PERSON> policies of national defense</ss>
<ss>"Trust me" government asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man; that we trust him to do what's best for us</ss>
<ss>My view of government places trust not in one person or one party, but in those values that transcend persons and parties</ss>
<ss>The trust is where it belongs--in the people</ss>
<ss>The responsibility to live up to that trust is where it belongs, in their elected leaders</ss>
<ss>That kind of relationship, between the people and their elected leaders, is a special kind of compact</ss>
<ss><DATE>, in <DATE>, a group of families dared to cross a mighty ocean to build a future for themselves in a new world</ss>
<ss>When they arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, they formed what they called a "compact"; an agreement among themselves to build a community and abide by its laws</ss>
<ss>The single act--the voluntary binding together of free people to live under the law--set the pattern for what was to come</ss>
<ss><DATE>, the descendants of those people pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to found this nation</ss>
<ss>Some forfeited their fortunes and their lives; none sacrificed honor</ss>
<ss>Four score and <DATE>, <PERSON> called upon the people of all America to renew their dedication and their commitment to a government of, for and by the people</ss>
<ss>Isn't it once again time to renew our compact of freedom; to pledge to each other all that is best in our lives; all that gives meaning to them--for the sake of this, our beloved and blessed land? Together, let us make this a new beginning</ss>
<ss>Let us make a commitment to care for the needy; to teach our children the values and the virtues handed down to us by our families; to have the courage to defend those values and the willingness to sacrifice for them</ss>
<ss>Let us pledge to restore, in our time, the <NORP> spirit of voluntary service, of cooperation, of private and community initiative; a spirit that flows like a deep and mighty river through the history of our nation</ss>
<ss>As your nominee, I pledge to restore to the federal government the capacity to do the people's work without dominating their lives</ss>
<ss>I pledge to you a government that will not only work well, but wisely; its ability to act tempered by prudence and its willingness to do good balanced by the knowledge that government is never more dangerous than when our desire to have it help us blinds us to its great power to harm us</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> <NORP> president once said, "While the people retain their virtue and their vigilance, no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can seriously injure the government in the short space of <DATE></ss>
<ss>" If Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> could see what's happened in these last three-and-a-half <DATE>s, he might hedge a little on that statement</ss>
<ss>But, with the virtues that our legacy as a free people and with the vigilance that sustains liberty, we still have time to use our renewed compact to overcome the injuries that have been done to America these past three-and-a-half <DATE>s</ss>
<ss>First, we must overcome something the present administration has cooked up: a new and altogether indigestible economic stew, one part inflation, one part high unemployment, one part recession, one part runaway taxes, one party deficit spending and seasoned by an energy crisis</ss>
<ss>It's an economic stew that has turned the national stomach</ss>
<ss>Ours are not problems of abstract economic theory</ss>
<ss>Those are problems of flesh and blood; problems that cause pain and destroy the moral fiber of real people who should not suffer the further indignity of being told by the government that it is all somehow their fault</ss>
<ss>We do not have inflation because -- as Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> says -- we have lived too well</ss>
<ss>The head of a government which has utterly refused to live within its means and which has, in <DATE>, told us that this <DATE>'s deficit will be <MONEY>, dares to point the finger of blame at business and labor, both of which have been engaged in a losing struggle just trying to stay even</ss>
<ss>High taxes, we are told, are somehow good for us, as if, when government spends our money it isn't inflationary, but when we spend it, it is</ss>
<ss>Those who preside over the worst energy shortage in our history tell us to use less, so that we will run out of oil, gasoline, and natural gas a little more slowly</ss>
<ss>Conservation is desirable, of course, for we must not waste energy</ss>
<ss>But conservation is not the sole answer to our energy needs</ss>
<ss>America must get to work producing more energy</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> program for solving economic problems is based on growth and productivity</ss>
<ss>Large amounts of oil and natural gas lay beneath our land and off our shores, untouched because the present administration seems to believe the <NORP> people would rather see more regulation, taxes and controls than more energy</ss>
<ss>Coal offers great potential</ss>
<ss>So does nuclear energy produced under rigorous safety standards</ss>
<ss>It could supply electricity for thousands of industries and millions of jobs and homes</ss>
<ss>It must not be thwarted by a tiny minority opposed to economic growth which often finds friendly ears in regulatory agencies for its obstructionist campaigns</ss>
<ss>Make no mistake</ss>
<ss>We will not permit the safety of our people or our environment heritage to be jeopardized, but we are going to reaffirm that the economic prosperity of our people is a fundamental part of our environment</ss>
<ss>Our problems are both acute and chronic, yet all we hear from those in positions of leadership are the same tired proposals for more government tinkering, more meddling and more control -- all of which led us to this state in the <ORDINAL> place</ss>
<ss>Can anyone look at the record of this administration and say, "Well done?" Can anyone compare the state of our economy when <ORG> took office with where we are <DATE> and say, "Keep up the good work?" Can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world <DATE> and say, "Let's have <DATE> of this?" I believe the <NORP> people are going to answer these questions <DATE> and their answer will be, "No--we've had enough</ss>
<ss>" And, then it will be up to us -- beginning <DATE> -- to offer an administration and congressional leadership of competence and more than a little courage</ss>
<ss>We must have the clarity of vision to see the difference between what is essential and what is merely desirable, and then the courage to bring our government back under control and make it acceptable to the people</ss>
<ss>It is essential that we maintain both the forward momentum of economic growth and the strength of the safety net beneath those in society who need help</ss>
<ss>We also believe it is essential that the integrity of all aspects of <ORG> are preserved</ss>
<ss>Beyond these essentials, I believe it is clear our federal government is overgrown and overweight</ss>
<ss>Indeed, it is time for our government to go on a diet</ss>
<ss>Therefore, my <ORDINAL> act as chief executive will be to impose an immediate and thorough freeze on federal hiring</ss>
<ss>Then, we are going to enlist the very best minds from business, labor and <DATE> to conduct a detailed review of every department, bureau and agency that lives by federal appropriations</ss>
<ss>We are also going to enlist the help and ideas of many dedicated and hard working government employees at all levels who want a more efficient government as much as the rest of us do</ss>
<ss>I know that many are demoralized by the confusion and waste they confront in their work as a result of failed and failing policies</ss>
<ss>Our instructions to the groups we enlist will be simple and direct</ss>
<ss>We will remind them that government programs exist at the sufferance of the <NORP> taxpayer and are paid for with money earned by working men and women</ss>
<ss>Any program that represents a waste of their money -- a theft from their pocketbooks--must have that waste eliminated or the program must go -- by executive order where possible; by congressional action where necessary</ss>
<ss>Everything that can be run more effectively by state and local government we shall turn over to state and local government, along with the funding sources to pay for it</ss>
<ss>We are going to put an end to the money merry-go-round where our money becomes Washington's money, to be spent by the states and cities exactly the way the federal bureaucrats tell them to</ss>
<ss>I will not accept the excuse that the federal government has grown so big and powerful that it is beyond the control of any president, any administration or <ORG></ss>
<ss>We are going to put an end to the notion that the <NORP> taxpayer exists to fund the federal government</ss>
<ss>The federal government exists to serve the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, we are going to re-establish that truth</ss>
<ss>Also on that date we are going to initiate action to get substantial relief for our taxpaying citizens and action to put people back to work</ss>
<ss>None of this will be based on any new form of monetary tinkering or fiscal sleight-of-hand</ss>
<ss>We will simply apply to government the common sense we all use in our <DATE> lives</ss>
<ss>Work and family are at the center of our lives; the foundation of our dignity as a free people</ss>
<ss>When we deprive people of what they have earned, or take away their jobs, we destroy their dignity and undermine their families</ss>
<ss>We cannot support our families unless there are jobs; and we cannot have jobs unless people have both money to invest and the faith to invest it</ss>
<ss>There are concepts that stem from an economic system that for <DATE> has helped us master a continent, create a previously undreamed of prosperity for our people and has fed millions of others around the globe</ss>
<ss>That system will continue to serve us in the future if our government will stop ignoring the basic values on which it was built and stop betraying the trust and good will of the <NORP> workers who keep it going</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people are carrying the heaviest peacetime tax burden in our nation's history -- and it will grow even heavier, under present law, <DATE></ss>
<ss>We are taxing ourselves into economic exhaustion and stagnation, crushing our ability and incentive to save, invest and produce</ss>
<ss>This must stop</ss>
<ss>We must halt this fiscal self-destruction and restore sanity to our economic system</ss>
<ss>I have long advocated a <PERCENT> reduction in income tax rates over <DATE></ss>
<ss>This phased tax reduction would begin with a <PERCENT> "down payment" tax cut in <DATE>, which the <NORP> and <ORG> and I have already proposed</ss>
<ss>A phased reduction of tax rates would go a long way toward easing the heavy burden on the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>But, we should not stop here</ss>
<ss>Within the context of economic conditions and appropriate budget priorities during <DATE> of my presidency, I would strive to go further</ss>
<ss>This would include improvement in business depreciation taxes so we can stimulate investment in order to get plants and equipment replaced, put more <NORP> back to work and put our nation back on the road to being competitive in world commerce</ss>
<ss>We will also work to reduce the cost of government as a percentage of our gross national product</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> task of national leadership is to set honest and realistic priorities in our policies and our budget and I pledge that my administration will do that</ss>
<ss>When I talk of tax cuts, I am reminded that every major tax cut in <DATE> has strengthened the economy, generated renewed productivity and ended up yielding new revenues for the government by creating new investment, new jobs and more commerce among our people</ss>
<ss>The present administration has been forced by us <NORP> to play follow-the-leader with regard to a tax cut</ss>
<ss>But, in <DATE> we must take with the proverbial "grain of salt" any tax cut proposed by those who have given us the greatest tax increase in our history</ss>
<ss>When those in leadership give us tax increases and tell us we must also do with less, have they thought about those who have always had less -- especially the minorities? This is like telling them that just as they step on the <ORDINAL> rung of the ladder of opportunity, the ladder is being pulled out from under them</ss>
<ss>That may be the <NORP> leadership's message to the minorities, but it won't be ours</ss>
<ss>Our message will be: we have to move ahead, but we're not going to leave anyone behind</ss>
<ss>Thanks to the economic policies of <ORG>, millions of <NORP> find themselves out of work</ss>
<ss>Millions more have never even had a fair chance to learn new skills, hold a decent job, or secure for themselves and their families a share in the prosperity of this nation</ss>
<ss>It is time to put America back to work; to make our cities and towns resound with the confident voices of men and women of all races, nationalities and faiths bringing home to their families a decent paycheck they can cash for honest money</ss>
<ss>For those without skills, we'll find a way to help them get skills</ss>
<ss>For those without job opportunities, we'll stimulate new opportunities, particularly in the inner cities where they live</ss>
<ss>For those who have abandoned hope, we'll restore hope and we'll welcome them into a great national crusade to make America great again! When we move from domestic affairs and cast our eyes abroad, we see an equally sorry chapter on the record of the present administration</ss>
<ss>- As <NORP> combat brigade trains in Cuba, <QUANTITY> from our shores</ss>
<ss>- A <NORP> army of invasion occupies Afghanistan, further threatening our vital interests in <LOC></ss>
<ss>- America's defense strength is at its lowest ebb in a generation, while the <NORP> Union is vastly outspending us in both strategic and conventional arms</ss>
<ss>- Our <NORP> allies, looking nervously at the growing menace from the <LOC>, turn to us for leadership and fail to find it</ss>
<ss>- And, incredibly more than 50 of our fellow <NORP> have been held captive for <DATE> by a dictatorial foreign power that holds us up to ridicule before the world</ss>
<ss>Adversaries large and small test our will and seek to confound our resolve, but we are given weakness when we need strength; vacillation when the times demand firmness</ss>
<ss>The <PERSON> Administration lives in the world of make-believe</ss>
<ss><DATE>, drawing up a response to that <DATE>'s problems, troubles, regardless of what happened <DATE> and what will happen <DATE></ss>
<ss>The rest of us, however, live in the real world</ss>
<ss>It is here that disasters are overtaking our nation without any real response from Washington</ss>
<ss>This is make-believe, self-deceit and -- above all -- transparent hypocrisy</ss>
<ss>For example, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> says he supports the volunteer army, but he lets military pay and benefits slip so low that many of our enlisted personnel are actually eligible for food stamps</ss>
<ss>Re-enlistment rates drop and, just recently, after he fought <DATE> against a proposal to increase the pay of our men and women in uniform, he helicoptered to our carrier, <ORG>, which was returning from <DATE> of duty</ss>
<ss>He told the crew that he advocated better pay for them and their comrades! Where does he really stand, now that he's back on shore? I'll tell you where I stand</ss>
<ss>I do not favor a peacetime draft or registration, but I do favor pay and benefit levels that will attract and keep highly motivated men and women in our volunteer forces and an active reserve trained and ready for an instant call in case of an emergency</ss>
<ss>There may be a sailor at the helm of the ship of state, but the ship has no rudder</ss>
<ss>Critical decisions are made at times almost in comic fashion, but who can laugh? Who was not embarrassed when the administration handed a major propaganda victory in <ORG> to the enemies of Israel, our staunch <LOC> ally for <DATE>, and them claim that the <NORP> vote was a "mistake," the result of a "failure of communication" between the president, his secretary of state, and his <PERSON> ambassador? Who does not feel a growing sense of unease as our allies, facing repeated instances of an amateurish and confused administration, reluctantly conclude that America is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations as the leader of the free world? Who does not feel rising alarm when the question in any discussion of foreign policy is no longer, "Should we do something?", but "Do we have the capacity to do anything?" The administration which has brought us to this state is seeking your endorsement for <DATE> of weakness, indecision, mediocrity and incompetence</ss>
<ss>No <NORP> should vote until he or she has asked, is the United States stronger and more respected now than it was three-and-a-half <DATE>s ago? Is the world <DATE> a safer place in which to live? It is the responsibility of the president of the United States, in working for peace, to insure that the safety of our people cannot successfully be threatened by a hostile foreign power</ss>
<ss>As president, fulfilling that responsibility will be my number one priority</ss>
<ss>We are not a warlike people</ss>
<ss>Quite the opposite</ss>
<ss>We always seek to live in peace</ss>
<ss>We resort to force infrequently and with great reluctance--and only after we have determined that it is absolutely necessary</ss>
<ss>We are awed--and rightly so--by the forces of destruction at loose in the world in this nuclear era</ss>
<ss>But neither can we be naive or foolish</ss>
<ss>Four times in my lifetime America has gone to war, bleeding the lives of its young men into the sands of beachheads, the fields of <LOC> and the jungles and rice paddies of <LOC></ss>
<ss>We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak</ss>
<ss>It is then that tyrants are tempted</ss>
<ss>We simply cannot learn these lessons the hard way again without risking our destruction</ss>
<ss>Of all the objectives we seek, <ORDINAL> and foremost is the establishment of lasting world peace</ss>
<ss>We must always stand ready to negotiate in good faith, ready to pursue any reasonable avenue that holds forth the promise of lessening tensions and furthering the prospects of peace</ss>
<ss>But let our friends and those who may wish us ill take note: the United States has an obligation to its citizens and to the people of the world never to let those who would destroy freedom dictate the future course of human life on this planet</ss>
<ss>I would regard my election as proof that we have renewed our resolve to preserve world peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>This nation will once again be strong enough to do that</ss>
<ss>This evening marks the last step--save one--of a campaign that has taken <PERSON> and me from one end of this great land to the other, over many months and <QUANTITY></ss>
<ss>There are those who question the way we choose a president; who say that our process imposes difficult and exhausting burdens on those who seek the office</ss>
<ss>I have not found it so</ss>
<ss>It is impossible to capture in words the splendor of this vast continent which <PERSON> has granted as our portion of this creation</ss>
<ss>There are no words to express the extraordinary strength and character of this breed of people we call <NORP></ss>
<ss>Everywhere we have met thousands of <NORP>, <NORP>, and <NORP> from all economic conditions and walks of life bound together in that community of shared values of family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>They are concerned, yes, but they are not frightened</ss>
<ss>They are disturbed, but not dismayed</ss>
<ss>They are the kind of men and women <PERSON> had in mind when he wrote--during <DATE> of the <NORP> Revolution--"We have it in our power to begin the world over again</ss>
<ss>" <DATE> after <PERSON> wrote those words, an <NORP> president told the generation of <EVENT> that it had a "rendezvous with destiny</ss>
<ss>" I believe that this generation of <NORP> <DATE> has a rendezvous with destiny</ss>
<ss><TIME>, let us dedicate ourselves to renewing the <NORP> compact</ss>
<ss>I ask you not simply to "Trust me," but to trust your values--our values--and to hold me responsible for living up to them</ss>
<ss>I ask you to trust that <NORP> spirit which knows no ethnic, religious, social, political, regional, or economic boundaries; the spirit that burned with zeal in the hearts of millions of immigrants from every corner of the <LOC> who came here in search of freedom</ss>
<ss>Some say that spirit no longer exists</ss>
<ss>But I have seen it -- I have felt it -- all across the land; in the big cities, the small towns and in rural America</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> spirit is still there, ready to blaze into life if you and I are willing to do what has to be done; the practical, down-to-earth things that will stimulate our economy, increase productivity and put America back to work</ss>
<ss>The time is now to resolve that the basis of a firm and principled foreign policy is one that takes the world as it is and seeks to change it by leadership and example; not by harangue, harassment or wishful thinking</ss>
<ss>The time is now to say that while we shall seek new friendships and expand and improve others, we shall not do so by breaking our word or casting aside old friends and allies</ss>
<ss>And, the time is now to redeem promises once made to the <NORP> people by another candidate, in another time and another place</ss>
<ss>He said, "For <DATE> I have been going up and down this country preaching that government--federal, state, and local--costs too much</ss>
<ss>I shall not stop that preaching</ss>
<ss>As an immediate program of action, we must abolish useless offices</ss>
<ss>We must eliminate unnecessary functions of government</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>we must consolidate subdivisions of government and, like the private citizen, give up luxuries which we can no longer afford</ss>
<ss>" "I propose to you, my friends, and through you that government of all kinds, big and little be made solvent and that the example be set by the president of the United State and his <ORG></ss>
<ss>" So said <PERSON> in his acceptance speech to <ORG> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The time is now, my fellow <NORP>, to recapture our destiny, to take it into our own hands</ss>
<ss>But, to do this will take many of us, working together</ss>
<ss>I ask you <TIME> to volunteer your help in this cause so we can carry our message throughout the land</ss>
<ss>Yes, isn't now the time that we, the people, carried out these unkempt promises? Let us pledge to each other and to all America on <DATE> <DATE>, we intend to do just that</ss>
<ss>I have thought of something that is not part of my speech and I'm worried over whether I should do it</ss>
<ss>Can we doubt that only a Divine Providence placed this land, this island of freedom, here as a refuge for all those people in the world who <DATE>n to breathe freely: <NORP> and <NORP> enduring persecution behind the Iron Curtain, the boat people of <LOC>, of Cuba and Haiti, the victims of drought and famine in <LOC>, the freedom fighters of Afghanistan and our own countrymen held in savage captivity</ss>
<ss>I'll confess that I've been a little afraid to suggest what I'm going to suggest -- I'm more afraid not to -- that we begin our crusade joined together in a moment of silent prayer</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Senator <PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss>President, Vice President <PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON>, Senator <PERSON>, Speaker <PERSON>, Reverend <PERSON>, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here <DATE> this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence</ss>
<ss>The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the <LAW> routinely takes place, as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are</ss>
<ss>In the eyes of ma in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss>President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition</ss>
<ss>By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic</ss>
<ss>The business of our nation goes forward</ss>
<ss>These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions</ss>
<ss>We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history</ss>
<ss>It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike</ss>
<ss>It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people</ss>
<ss>Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity</ss>
<ss>Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity</ss>
<ss>But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present</ss>
<ss>To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals</ss>
<ss>You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time</ss>
<ss>Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by that same limitation? We must act <DATE> in order to preserve <DATE></ss>
<ss>And let there be no misunderstanding: We are going to begin to act, beginning <DATE></ss>
<ss>The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over <DATE></ss>
<ss>They will not go away in <DATE>, <DATE>, or <DATE>, but they will go away</ss>
<ss>They will go away because we as <NORP> have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom</ss>
<ss>In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem</ss>
<ss>From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people</ss>
<ss>Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden</ss>
<ss>The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price</ss>
<ss>We hear much of special interest groups</ss>
<ss>Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected</ss>
<ss>It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines</ss>
<ss>It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sick -- professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers</ss>
<ss>They are, in short, "We the people," this breed called <NORP></ss>
<ss>Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all <NORP> with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination</ss>
<ss>Putting America back to work means putting all <NORP> back to work</ss>
<ss>Ending inflation means freeing all <NORP> from the terror of runaway living costs</ss>
<ss>All must share in the productive work of this "new beginning," and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy</ss>
<ss>With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world</ss>
<ss>So, as we begin, let us take inventory</ss>
<ss>We are a nation that has a government -- not the other way around</ss>
<ss>And this makes us special among the nations of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Our government has no power except that granted it by the people</ss>
<ss>It is time to check and reverse the growth of government, which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed</ss>
<ss>It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to <ORG> and those reserved to the States or to the people</ss>
<ss>All of us need to be reminded that <ORG> did not create the States; the States created <ORG></ss>
<ss>Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it's not my intention to do away with government</ss>
<ss>It is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back</ss>
<ss>Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it</ss>
<ss>If we look to the answer as to why for <DATE> we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on <LOC>, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before</ss>
<ss>Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on <LOC></ss>
<ss>The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price</ss>
<ss>It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government</ss>
<ss>It is time for us to realize that we're too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams</ss>
<ss>We're not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline</ss>
<ss>I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do</ss>
<ss>I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing</ss>
<ss>So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal</ss>
<ss>Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength</ss>
<ss>And let us renew our faith and our hope</ss>
<ss>We have every right to dream heroic dreams</ss>
<ss>Those who say that we're in a time when there are not heroes, they just don't know where to look</ss>
<ss>You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates</ss>
<ss>Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond</ss>
<ss>You meet heroes across a counter, and they're on both sides of that counter</ss>
<ss>There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity</ss>
<ss>They're individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education</ss>
<ss>Their patriotism is quiet, but deep</ss>
<ss>Their values sustain our national life</ss>
<ss>Now, I have used the words "they" and "their" in speaking of these heroes</ss>
<ss>I could say "you" and "your," because I'm addressing the heroes of whom I speak -- you, the citizens of this blessed land</ss>
<ss>Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God</ss>
<ss>We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup</ss>
<ss>How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they're sick, and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory? Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic "yes</ss>
<ss>" To paraphrase <PERSON>, I did not take the oath I've just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity</ss>
<ss>Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government</ss>
<ss>Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress</ss>
<ss>It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden</ss>
<ss>And these will be our <ORDINAL> priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise</ss>
<ss>On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among <ORG>, Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, president of <ORG>, said to his fellow <NORP>, "Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>On you depend the fortunes of America</ss>
<ss>You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn</ss>
<ss>Act worthy of yourselves</ss>
<ss>" Well, I believe we, the <NORP> of <DATE>, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children's children</ss>
<ss>And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world</ss>
<ss>We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom</ss>
<ss>To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment</ss>
<ss>We will match loyalty with loyalty</ss>
<ss>We will strive for mutually beneficial relations</ss>
<ss>We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale</ss>
<ss>As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it, now or ever</ss>
<ss>Our forbearance should never be misunderstood</ss>
<ss>Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will</ss>
<ss>When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act</ss>
<ss>We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength</ss>
<ss>Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women</ss>
<ss>It is a weapon our adversaries in <DATE>'s world do not have</ss>
<ss>It is a weapon that we as <NORP> do have</ss>
<ss>Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and <PERSON> upon their neighbors</ss>
<ss>I'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on <DATE>, and for that I'm deeply grateful</ss>
<ss>We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free</ss>
<ss>It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inaugural Day in <DATE> it should be declared <DATE> of prayer</ss>
<ss>This is the <ORDINAL> time in our history that this ceremony has been held, as you've been told, on this West Front of the <FAC></ss>
<ss>Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history</ss>
<ss>At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand</ss>
<ss>Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, <PERSON>, father of our country</ss>
<ss>A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly</ss>
<ss>He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood</ss>
<ss>Off to one side, the stately memorial to <PERSON></ss>
<ss>The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence</ss>
<ss>And then, beyond <FAC>, the dignified columns of <FAC></ss>
<ss>Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Beyond those monuments to heroism is <LOC>, and on the far shore the sloping hills of <FAC>, with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of <PERSON></ss>
<ss>They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom</ss>
<ss>Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier</ss>
<ss>Their lives ended in places called <ORG>, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, <LOC>, Pork Chop Hill, <FAC>, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam</ss>
<ss>Under one such marker lies a young man, <PERSON>, who left his job in a small town barbershop in <DATE> to go to France with the famed <ORG></ss>
<ss>There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire</ss>
<ss>We're told that on his body was found a diary</ss>
<ss>On the flyleaf under the heading, "My Pledge," he had written these words: "America must win this war</ss>
<ss>Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone</ss>
<ss>" The crisis we are facing <DATE> does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that <PERSON> and so many thousands of others were called upon to make</ss>
<ss>It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us</ss>
<ss>And after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are <NORP></ss>
<ss>God bless you, and thank you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: I have no words to express my appreciation for that greeting</ss>
<ss>I have come to speak to you <TIME> about our economic recovery program and why I believe it's essential that the <ORG> approve this package, which I believe will lift the crushing burden of inflation off of our citizens and restore the vitality to our economy and our industrial machine</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, however, and due to events of <DATE>, will you permit me to digress for a moment from the all-important subject of why we must bring government spending under control and reduce tax rates</ss>
<ss>I'd like to say a few words directly to all of you and to those who are watching and listening <TIME>, because this is the only way I know to express to all of you on behalf of <PERSON> and myself our appreciation for your messages and flowers and, most of all, your prayers, not only for me but for those others who fell beside me</ss>
<ss>The warmth of your words, the expression of friendship and, yes, love, meant more to us than you can ever know</ss>
<ss>You have given us a memory that we'll treasure forever</ss>
<ss>And you've provided an answer to those few voices that were raised saying that what happened was evidence that ours is a sick society</ss>
<ss>The society we heard from is made up of millions of compassionate <NORP> and their children, from college age to kindergarten</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, as evidence of that I have a letter with me</ss>
<ss>The letter came from <PERSON></ss>
<ss>He's in the <ORDINAL> grade in <ORG> in Rockville Centre, and he said, "I hope you get well quick or you might have to make a speech in your pajamas</ss>
<ss>"  He added a postscript</ss>
<ss>"<PERSON> If you have to make a speech in your pajamas, I warned you</ss>
<ss>"  Well, sick societies don't produce men like the two who recently returned from outer space</ss>
<ss>Sick societies don't produce young men like <ORG> agent <PERSON>, who placed his body between mine and the man with the gun simply because he felt that's what his duty called for him to do</ss>
<ss>Sick societies don't produce dedicated police officers like <PERSON> or able and devoted public servants like <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Sick societies don't make people like us so proud to be <NORP> and so very proud of our fellow citizens</ss>
<ss>Now, let's talk about getting spending and inflation under control and cutting your tax rates</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and Senator <PERSON>, I want to thank you for your cooperation in helping to arrange this joint session of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>I won't be speaking to you very long <TIME>, but I asked for this meeting because the urgency of our joint mission has not changed</ss>
<ss>Thanks to some very fine people, my health is much improved</ss>
<ss>I'd like to be able to say that with regard to the health of the economy</ss>
<ss>It's been <DATE> since the election that charged all of us in this Government with the task of restoring our economy</ss>
<ss>Where have we come in <DATE>? Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has continued at a double-digit rate</ss>
<ss>Mortgage interest rates have averaged <PERCENT> for <DATE>, preventing families across America from buying homes</ss>
<ss>There are still almost 8 million unemployed</ss>
<ss>The average worker's <TIME> earnings after adjusting for inflation are lower <DATE> than they were <DATE>, and there have been over 6,000 business failures</ss>
<ss><DATE> is long enough</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people now want us to act and not in half measures</ss>
<ss>They demand and they've earned a full and comprehensive effort to clean up our economic mess</ss>
<ss>Because of the extent of our economy's sickness, we know that the cure will not come quickly and that even with our package, progress will come in inches and feet, not in miles</ss>
<ss>But to fail to act will delay even longer and more painfully the cure which must come</ss>
<ss>And that cure begins with the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>And the budgetary actions taken by the <ORG> over <DATE> will determine how we respond to the message of <DATE></ss>
<ss>That message was very simple</ss>
<ss>Our government is too big, and it spends too much</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, you and I have enjoyed a relationship based on extraordinary cooperation</ss>
<ss>Because of this cooperation we've come a long distance in <DATE></ss>
<ss>I want to thank the leadership of the <ORG> for helping in setting a fair timetable for consideration of our recommendations</ss>
<ss>And committee chairmen on both sides of the aisle have called prompt and thorough hearings</ss>
<ss>We have also communicated in a spirit of candor, openness, and mutual respect</ss>
<ss><TIME>, as our decision day nears and as <ORG> weighs its alternatives, I wish to address you in that same spirit</ss>
<ss><ORG>, under the leadership of <PERSON>, has just <DATE> voted out a budget resolution supported by <NORP> and <NORP> alike that is in all major respects consistent with the program that we have proposed</ss>
<ss>Now we look forward to favorable action on the <ORG> floor, but an equally crucial test involves <ORG></ss>
<ss>The <ORG> will soon be choosing between two different versions or measures to deal with the economy</ss>
<ss>One is the measure offered by <ORG></ss>
<ss>The other is a bipartisan measure, a substitute introduced by <ORG>men <PERSON> of Texas and <PERSON> of Ohio</ss>
<ss>On behalf of the administration, let me say that we embrace and fully support that bipartisan substitute</ss>
<ss>It will achieve all the essential aims of controlling government spending, reducing the tax burden, building a national defense <ORDINAL> to none, and stimulating economic growth and creating millions of new jobs</ss>
<ss>At the same time, however, I must state our opposition to the measure offered by <ORG></ss>
<ss>It may appear that we have two alternatives</ss>
<ss>In reality, however, there are no more alternatives left</ss>
<ss>The committee measure quite simply falls far too short of the essential actions that we must take</ss>
<ss>For example, in <DATE>, the committee measure projects spending <MONEY> more than does the bipartisan substitute</ss>
<ss>It regrettably cuts over <MONEY> in essential defense spending, funding required to restore America's national security</ss>
<ss>It adheres to the failed policy of trying to balance the budget on the taxpayer's back</ss>
<ss>It would increase tax payments by over a third, adding up to a staggering quarter of <MONEY></ss>
<ss><ORG> taxes would increase <PERCENT> each year</ss>
<ss>Taxpayers would be paying a larger share of their income to government in <DATE> than they do at present</ss>
<ss>In short, that measure reflects an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future</ss>
<ss>High taxes and excess spending growth created our present economic mess; more of the same will not cure the hardship, anxiety, and discouragement it has imposed on the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>Let us cut through the fog for a moment</ss>
<ss>The answer to a government that's too big is to stop feeding its growth</ss>
<ss>Government spending has been growing faster than the economy itself</ss>
<ss>The massive national debt which we accumulated is the result of the government's high spending diet</ss>
<ss>Well, it's time to change the diet and to change it in the right way</ss>
<ss>I know the tax portion of our package is of concern to some of you</ss>
<ss>Let me make a few points that I feel have been overlooked</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> of all, it should be looked at as an integral part of the entire package, not something separate and apart from the budget reductions, the regulatory relief, and the monetary restraints</ss>
<ss>Probably the most common misconception is that we are proposing to reduce Government revenues to less than what the Government has been receiving</ss>
<ss>This is not true</ss>
<ss>Actually, the discussion has to do with how much of a tax increase should be imposed on the taxpayer in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, I know that over the recess in some informal polling some of your constituents have been asked which they'd rather have, a balanced budget or a tax cut, and with the common sense that characterizes the people of this country, the answer, of course, has been a balanced budget</ss>
<ss>But may I suggest, with no inference that there was wrong intent on the part of those who asked the question, the question was inappropriate to the situation</ss>
<ss>Our choice is not between a balanced budget and a tax cut</ss>
<ss>Properly asked, the question is, "Do you want a great big raise in your taxes <DATE> or, at the worst, a very little increase with the prospect of tax reduction and a balanced budget down the road a ways?" With the common sense that the people have already shown, I'm sure we all know what the answer to that question would be</ss>
<ss>A gigantic tax increase has been built into the system</ss>
<ss>We propose nothing more than a reduction of that increase</ss>
<ss>The people have a right to know that even with our plan they will be paying more in taxes, but not as much more as they will without it</ss>
<ss>The option, I believe, offered by <ORG>, will leave spending too high and tax rates too high</ss>
<ss>At the same time, I think it cuts the defense budget too much, and by attempting to reduce the deficit through higher taxes, it will not create the kind of strong economic growth and the new jobs that we must have</ss>
<ss>Let us not overlook the fact that the small, independent business man or woman creates <PERCENT> of all the new jobs and employs more than half of our total work force</ss>
<ss>Our across-the-board cut in tax rates for a 3-year period will give them much of the incentive and promise of stability they need to go forward with expansion plans calling for additional employees</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I renew my call for us to work as a team, to join in cooperation so that we find answers which will begin to solve all our economic problems and not just some of them</ss>
<ss>The economic recovery package that I've outlined to you over <DATE> is, I deeply believe, the only answer that we have left</ss>
<ss>Reducing the growth of spending, cutting marginal tax rates, providing relief from overregulation, and following a noninflationary and predictable monetary policy are interwoven measures which will ensure that we have addressed each of the severe dislocations which threaten our economic future</ss>
<ss>These policies will make our economy stronger, and the stronger economy will balance the budget which we're committed to do by <DATE></ss>
<ss>When I took the oath of office, I pledged loyalty to only one special interest group -- "We the people</ss>
<ss>" Those people -- neighbors and friends, shopkeepers and laborers, farmers and craftsmen -- do not have infinite patience</ss>
<ss>As a matter fact, <DATE>, <PERSON> wrote these instructive words in his <ORDINAL> message to the <ORG>: "The <NORP> people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled, it burns like a consuming flame</ss>
<ss>" Well, perhaps that kind of wrath will be deserved if our answer to these serious problems is to repeat the mistakes of the past</ss>
<ss>The old and comfortable way is to shave a little here and add a little there</ss>
<ss>Well, that's not acceptable anymore</ss>
<ss>I think this great and historic <ORG> knows that way is no longer acceptable</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss>I think you've shown that you know the one sure way to continue the inflationary spiral is to fall back into the predictable patterns of old economic practices</ss>
<ss>Isn't it time that we tried something new? When you allowed me to speak to you here in these chambers a little earlier, I told you that I wanted this program for economic recovery to be ours-yours and mine</ss>
<ss>I think the bipartisan substitute bill has achieved that purpose</ss>
<ss>It moves us toward economic vitality</ss>
<ss><DATE>, you and I joined millions of our fellow <NORP> in marveling at the magic historical moment that <PERSON> and <PERSON> created in their space shuttle, <ORG></ss>
<ss>The last manned effort was <DATE>, and I remembered on <DATE>, over <DATE>, how we'd all come to expect technological precision of our men and machines</ss>
<ss>And each amazing achievement became commonplace, until the next new challenge was raised</ss>
<ss>With the space shuttle we tested our ingenuity once again, moving beyond the accomplishments of the past into the promise and uncertainty of the future</ss>
<ss>Thus, we not only planned to send up a 122-foot aircraft <QUANTITY> into space, but we also intended to make it maneuverable and return it to <LOC>, landing <QUANTITY> of exotic metals delicately on a remote, dry lake-bed</ss>
<ss>The space shuttle did more than prove our technological abilities</ss>
<ss>It raised our expectations once more</ss>
<ss>It started us dreaming again</ss>
<ss>The poet <PERSON> wrote, "The republic is a dream</ss>
<ss>Nothing happens unless <ORDINAL> a dream</ss>
<ss>" And that's what makes us, as <NORP>, different</ss>
<ss>We've always reached for a new spirit and aimed at a higher goal</ss>
<ss>We've been courageous and determined, unafraid and bold</ss>
<ss>Who among us wants to be <ORDINAL> to say we no longer have those qualities, that we must limp along, doing the same things that have brought us our present misery? I believe that the people you and I represent are ready to chart a new course</ss>
<ss>They look to us to meet the great challenge, to reach beyond the commonplace and not fall short for lack of creativity or courage</ss>
<ss>Someone you know has said that he who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers</ss>
<ss>Well, we have much greatness before us</ss>
<ss>We can restore our economic strength and build opportunities like none we've ever had before</ss>
<ss>As <PERSON> said, all we need to begin with is a dream that we can do better than before</ss>
<ss>All we need to have is faith, and that dream will come true</ss>
<ss>All we need to do is act, and the time for action is now</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>Good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Father <PERSON>, I thank you very much and for so many things</ss>
<ss>The distinguished honor that you've conferred upon me here <DATE>, I must say, however, compounds a sense of guilt that I have nursed for <DATE></ss>
<ss>I thought the <ORDINAL> degree I was given was honorary</ss>
<ss>But it's wonderful to be here <DATE> with Governor <PERSON>, Governor <PERSON>, Senators <PERSON> and <PERSON>, and <PERSON>, these distinguished honorees, the trustees, administration, faculty, students, and friends of <FAC> and, most important, the graduating class of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Nancy and I are greatly honored to share <DATE> with you, and our pleasure has been more than doubled because I am also sharing the platform with a longtime and very dear friend, <PERSON></ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I haven't been able to see much of each other lately, so I haven't had a chance to tell him that there is now another tie that binds us together</ss>
<ss>Until <DATE> I knew very little about my father's ancestry</ss>
<ss>He had been orphaned at <DATE></ss>
<ss>But now I've learned that his grandfather, my great-grandfather, left Ireland to come to America, leaving his home in <LOC>, a village in County Tipperary in Ireland, and I have learned that <LOC> is the ancestral home of the O'Briens</ss>
<ss>Now, if I don't watch out, this may turn out to be less of a commencement than a warm bath in nostalgic memories</ss>
<ss>Growing up in Illinois, I was influenced by a sports legend so national in scope, it was almost mystical</ss>
<ss>It is difficult to explain to anyone who didn't live in those times</ss>
<ss>The legend was based on a combination of three elements: a game, football; a university, <FAC>; and a man, <WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>There has been nothing like it before or since</ss>
<ss>My <ORDINAL> time to ever see <FAC> was to come here as a sports announcer, <DATE> out of college, to broadcast a football game</ss>
<ss>You won or I wouldn't have mentioned it</ss>
<ss>A number of <DATE> I returned here in the company of <PERSON> and a galaxy of Hollywood stars for the world premiere of "<WORK_OF_ART> -- All <NORP>" in which I was privileged to play <PERSON></ss>
<ss>I've always suspected that there might have been many actors in Hollywood who could have played the part better, but no one could have wanted to play it more than I did</ss>
<ss>And I was given the part largely because the star of that picture, <PERSON>, kindly and generously held out a helping hand to a beginning young actor</ss>
<ss>Having come from the world of sports, I'd been trying to write a story about <WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>I must confess that I had someone in mind to play the <PERSON></ss>
<ss>On one of my sports broadcasts before going to Hollywood, I had told the story of his career and tragic death</ss>
<ss>I didn't have very many words on paper when I learned that the studio that employed me was already preparing a story treatment for that film</ss>
<ss>And that brings me to the theme of my remarks</ss>
<ss>I'm the <ORDINAL> President of the United <ORG>s to address a <FAC> commencement</ss>
<ss>The temptation is great to use this forum as an address on a great international or national issue that has nothing to do with this occasion</ss>
<ss>Indeed, this is somewhat traditional</ss>
<ss>So, I wasn't surprised when I read in several reputable journals that I was going to deliver an address on foreign policy or on the economy</ss>
<ss>I'm not going to talk about either</ss>
<ss>But, by the same token, I'll try not to belabor you with some of the standard rhetoric that is beloved of graduation speakers</ss>
<ss>For example, I'm not going to tell you that "You know more <DATE> that you've ever known before or that you will ever know again</ss>
<ss>" The other standby is, "When I was <DATE>, I didn't think my father knew anything</ss>
<ss>By the time I was <DATE>, I was amazed at how much the old gentleman had learned in <DATE></ss>
<ss>" And then, of course, the traditional and the standby is that "A university like this is a storehouse of knowledge because the freshmen bring so much in and the seniors take so little away</ss>
<ss>" You members of the graduating class of 18 -- or <DATE> -- I don't really go back that far -- are what behaviorists call achievers</ss>
<ss>And while you will look back with warm pleasure on your memories of <DATE> that brought you here to where you are <DATE>, you are also, I know, looking at the future that seems uncertain to most of you but which, let me assure you, offers great expectations</ss>
<ss>Take pride in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Thank your parents, as one on your behalf has already done here</ss>
<ss>Thank those who've been of help to you over <DATE></ss>
<ss>And do a little celebrating; you're entitled</ss>
<ss>This is your day, and whatever I say should take cognizance of that fact</ss>
<ss>It is a milestone in life, and it marks a time of change</ss>
<ss>Winston Churchill, during the darkest period of the "Battle of Britain" in <EVENT> said: "When great causes are on the move in the world</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>we learn we are spirits, not animals, and that something is going on in space and time, and beyond space and time, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty</ss>
<ss>" Now, I'm going to mention again that movie that <PERSON> and I and <FAC> were in, because it says something about America</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, <WORK_OF_ART> as a boy came to America with his parents from Norway</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE> it took him to grow up to college age, he became so <NORP> that here at <FAC>, he became an All <NORP> in a game that is still, to <DATE>, uniquely <NORP></ss>
<ss>As a coach, he did more than teach young men how to play a game</ss>
<ss>He believed truly that the noblest work of man was building the character of man</ss>
<ss>And maybe that's why he was a living legend</ss>
<ss>No man connected with football has ever achieved the stature or occupied the singular niche in the <ORG> that he carved out for himself, not just in a sport, but in our entire social structure</ss>
<ss>Now, <DATE> I hear very often, "Win one for the <PERSON>," spoken in a humorous vein</ss>
<ss>Lately I've been hearing it by Congressmen who are supportive of the programs that I've introduced</ss>
<ss>But let's look at the significance of that story</ss>
<ss><PERSON> could have used <PERSON>'s dying words to win a game any time</ss>
<ss>But <DATE> went by following the death of <PERSON> before <PERSON> revealed those dying words, his deathbed wish</ss>
<ss>And then he told the story at halftime to a team that was losing, and one of the only teams he had ever coached that was torn by dissension and jealousy and factionalism</ss>
<ss>The seniors on that team were about to close out their football careers without learning or experiencing any of the real values that a game has to impart</ss>
<ss>None of them had known <PERSON></ss>
<ss>They were children when he played for <FAC></ss>
<ss>It was to this team that <PERSON> told the story and so inspired them that they rose above their personal animosities</ss>
<ss>For someone they had never known, they joined together in a common cause and attained the unattainable</ss>
<ss>We were told when we were making the picture of one line that was spoken by a player during that game</ss>
<ss>We were actually afraid to put it in the picture</ss>
<ss>The man who carried the ball over for the winning touchdown was injured on the play</ss>
<ss>We were told that as he was lifted on the stretcher and carried off the field he was heard to say, "That's the last one I can get for you, <PERSON></ss>
<ss>" Now, it's only a game</ss>
<ss>And maybe to hear it now, afterward -- and this is what we feared -- it might sound maudlin and not the way it was intended</ss>
<ss>But is there anything wrong with young people having an experience, feeling something so deeply, thinking of someone else to the point that they can give so completely of themselves? There will come times in the lives of all of us when we'll be faced with causes bigger than ourselves, and they won't be on a playing field</ss>
<ss>This <ORG> was born when a band of men, <ORG>, a group so unique we've never seen their like since, rose to such selfless heights</ss>
<ss>Lawyers, tradesmen, merchants, farmers -- 56 men achieved security and standing in life but valued freedom more</ss>
<ss>They pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor</ss>
<ss>Sixteen of them gave their lives</ss>
<ss>Most gave their fortunes</ss>
<ss>All preserved their sacred honor</ss>
<ss>They gave us more than a nation</ss>
<ss>They brought to all mankind for the <ORDINAL> time the concept that man was born free, that each of us has inalienable rights, ours by the grace of God, and that government was created by us for our convenience, having only the powers that we choose to give it</ss>
<ss>This is the heritage that you're about to claim as you come out to join the society made up of those who have preceded you by <DATE>, or some of us by a great many</ss>
<ss>This experiment in man's relation to man is <DATE> into its <DATE></ss>
<ss>Saying that may make it sound quite old</ss>
<ss>But let's look at it from another viewpoint or perspective</ss>
<ss><DATE>, someone figured out that if you could condense the entire history of life on <LOC> into a motion picture that would run for <TIME> a day, <DATE> -- maybe on <EVENT> we could have an intermission -- this idea that is the United <ORG>s wouldn't appear on the screen until <TIME> <DATE></ss>
<ss>And in those 3? <TIME> not only would a new concept of society come into being, a golden hope for all mankind, but more than half the activity, economic activity in world history, would take place on this continent</ss>
<ss>Free to express their genius, individual <NORP>, men and women, in <TIME>, would perform such miracles of invention, construction, and production as the world had never seen</ss>
<ss>As you join us out there beyond the campus, you know there are great unsolved problems</ss>
<ss>Federalism, with its built in checks and balances, has been distorted</ss>
<ss>Central government has usurped powers that properly belong to local and <ORG> governments</ss>
<ss>And in so doing, in many ways that central government has begun to fail to do the things that are truly the responsibility of a central government</ss>
<ss>All of this has led to the misuse of power and preemption of the prerogatives of people and their social institutions</ss>
<ss>You are graduating from a great private, or, if you will, independent university</ss>
<ss>Not too many years ago, such schools were relatively free from government interference</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, government has spawned regulations covering virtually every facet of our lives</ss>
<ss>The independent and church-supported colleges and universities have found themselves enmeshed in that network of regulations and the costly blizzard of paperwork that government is demanding</ss>
<ss>Thirty-four congressional committees and almost 80 subcommittees have jurisdiction over 439 separate laws affecting education at the college level alone</ss>
<ss>Almost every aspect of campus life is now regulated -- hiring, firing, promotions, physical plant, construction, record-keeping, fund-raising and, to some extent, curriculum and educational programs</ss>
<ss>I hope when you leave this campus that you will do so with a feeling of obligation to your alma mater</ss>
<ss>She will need your help and support in <DATE> to come</ss>
<ss>If ever the great independent colleges and universities like <FAC> give way to and are replaced by tax-supported institutions, the struggle to preserve academic freedom will have been lost</ss>
<ss>We're troubled <DATE> by economic stagnation, brought on by inflated currency and prohibitive taxes and burdensome regulations</ss>
<ss>The cost of stagnation in human terms, mostly among those least equipped to survive it, is cruel and inhuman</ss>
<ss>Now, after those remarks, don't decide that you'd better turn your diploma back in so you can stay <DATE> on the campus</ss>
<ss>I've just given you the bad news</ss>
<ss>The good news is that something is being done about all this because the people of America have said, "Enough already</ss>
<ss>" You know, we who had preceded you had just gotten so busy that we let things get out of hand</ss>
<ss>We forgot that we were the keepers of the power, forgot to challenge the notion that the state is the principal vehicle of social change, forgot that millions of social interactions among free individuals and institutions can do more to foster economic and social progress than all the careful schemes of government planners</ss>
<ss>Well, at last we're remembering, remembering that government has certain legitimate functions which it can perform very well, that it can be responsive to the people, that it can be humane and compassionate, but that when it undertakes tasks that are not its proper province, it can do none of them as well or as economically as the private sector</ss>
<ss>For too long government has been fixing things that aren't broken and inventing miracle cures for unknown diseases</ss>
<ss>We need you</ss>
<ss>We need your youth</ss>
<ss>We need your strength</ss>
<ss>We need your idealism to help us make right that which is wrong</ss>
<ss>Now, I know that this period of your life, you have been and are critically looking at the mores and customs of the past and questioning their value</ss>
<ss>Every generation does that</ss>
<ss>May I suggest, don't discard the time-tested values upon which civilization was built simply because they're old</ss>
<ss>More important, don't let <DATE>'s doom criers and cynics persuade you that the best is past, that from here on it's all downhill</ss>
<ss>Each generation sees farther than the generation that preceded it because it stands on the shoulders of that generation</ss>
<ss>You're going to have opportunities beyond anything that we've ever known</ss>
<ss>The people have made it plain already</ss>
<ss>They want an end to excessive government intervention in their lives and in the economy, an end to the burdensome and unnecessary regulations and a punitive tax policy that does take "from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned</ss>
<ss>" They want a government that cannot only continue to send men across the vast reaches of space and bring them safely home, but that can guarantee that you and I can walk in the park of our neighborhood after dark and get safely home</ss>
<ss>And finally, they want to know that this <ORG> has the ability to defend itself against those who would seek to pull it down</ss>
<ss>And all of this, we the people can do</ss>
<ss>Indeed, a start has already been made</ss>
<ss>There's a task force under the leadership of the Vice President, <PERSON>, that is to look at those regulations I've spoken of</ss>
<ss>They have already identified hundreds of them that can be wiped out with no harm to the quality of life</ss>
<ss>And the cancellation of just those regulations will leave <MONEY> in the hands of the people for productive enterprise and research and development and the creation of jobs</ss>
<ss><DATE> are great ones for this country, for the cause of freedom and the spread of civilization</ss>
<ss>The <LOC> won't contain communism, it will transcend communism</ss>
<ss>It won't bother to dismiss or denounce it, it will dismiss it as some bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, at a <WORK_OF_ART> ceremony some time back, said man "would not only  endure: he will prevail" against the modern world because he will return to "the old verities and truths of the heart</ss>
<ss>" And then <PERSON> said of man, "He is immortal because he alone among creatures</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance</ss>
<ss>" One can't say those words -- compassion, sacrifice, and endurance -- without thinking of the irony that one who so exemplifies them, Pope <PERSON>, a man of peace and goodness, an inspiration to the world, would be struck by a bullet from a man towards whom he could only feel compassion and love</ss>
<ss>It was Pope <PERSON> who warned in <DATE> encyclical on mercy and justice against certain economic theories that use the rhetoric of class struggle to justify injustice</ss>
<ss>He said, "In the name of an alleged justice the neighbor is sometimes destroyed, killed, deprived of liberty or stripped of fundamental human rights</ss>
<ss>" For the <LOC>, for America, the time has come to dare to show to the world that our civilized ideas, our traditions, our values, are not -- like the ideology and war machine of <NORP> societies -- just a facade of strength</ss>
<ss>It is time for the world to know our intellectual and spiritual values are rooted in the source of all strength, a belief in <FAC>, and a law higher than our own</ss>
<ss>When it's written, history of our time won't dwell long on the hardships of the recent past</ss>
<ss>But history will ask -- and our answer determine the fate of freedom for <DATE> -- Did a nation born of hope lose hope? Did a people forged by courage find courage wanting'? Did a generation steeled by hard war and a harsh peace forsake honor at the moment of great climactic struggle for the human spirit? If history asks such questions, it also answers them</ss>
<ss>And the answers are to be found in the heritage left by generations of <NORP> before us</ss>
<ss>They stand in silent witness to what the world will soon know and history someday record: that in <DATE>, the <NORP> <ORG> came of age, affirmed its leadership of free men and women serving selflessly a vision of man with God, government for people, and humanity at peace</ss>
<ss><DATE>, an <NORP> Prime Minister, <PERSON>, said, "I wonder if anybody ever thought what the situation for the comparatively small nations in the world would be if there were not in existence the United <ORG>s, if there were not this giant country prepared to make so many sacrifices</ss>
<ss>" This is the noble and rich heritage rooted in great civil ideas of the <LOC>, and it is yours</ss>
<ss>My hope <DATE> is that in <DATE> to come -- and come it shall -- when it's your time to explain to another generation the meaning of the past and thereby hold out to them their promise of the future, that you'll recall the truths and traditions of which we've spoken</ss>
<ss>It is these truths and traditions that define our civilization and make up our national heritage</ss>
<ss>And now, they're yours to protect and pass on</ss>
<ss>I have one more hope for you: when you do speak to the next generation about these things, that you will always be able to speak of an America that is strong and free, to find in your hearts an unbounded pride in this much-loved country, this once and future land, this bright and hopeful nation whose generous spirit and great ideals the world still honors</ss>
<ss>Congratulations, and God bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I thank you very much for that introduction and that explanation also of my <DATE>'s tardiness in getting here</ss>
<ss>I remember <DATE> I was in California when I received your invitation at the same time that I received a clipping that I had not answered your invitation</ss>
<ss>Now, at that moment it was almost impossible for me -- well, it was impossible to find a way -- not even <PRODUCT> could have bridged from California to Florida</ss>
<ss>But I'm delighted that this time, as you say, there was better staff work and I was able to get the invitation in plenty of time</ss>
<ss>President <PERSON>, Vice Chairman <PERSON>, and Executive Director <PERSON>, the ladies and gentlemen here on the platform, the members of the board of directors, and you, ladies and gentlemen, representatives to this convention: I'm very happy to be talking to the <ORG>'s <ORDINAL> <DATE> convention</ss>
<ss>There are many things that we need to discuss, and I thank you for the invitation to do so</ss>
<ss>Let us talk <DATE> about the needs of the future, not the misunderstandings of the past; about new ideas, not old ones; about what must become a continuing dialog, not a dialog that flows only at intermittent conventions that we both attend</ss>
<ss>Part of that continuing dialog took place <DATE> when I met with <PERSON> and <PERSON> in <FAC></ss>
<ss>Our discussion was candid and useful</ss>
<ss>The wide range of our conversation showed that there is a great deal to be gained when we take time to share our views</ss>
<ss>And while our communication should always deal with current issues of importance, it must never stray far from our national commitment to battle against discrimination and increase our knowledge of each other</ss>
<ss>A few isolated groups in the backwater of <NORP> life still hold perverted notions of what America is all about</ss>
<ss>Recently in some places in the nation there's been a disturbing reoccurrence of bigotry and violence</ss>
<ss>If I may, from the platform of this organization, known for its tolerance, I would like to address a few remarks to those groups who still adhere to senseless racism and religious prejudice, to those individuals who persist in such hateful behavior</ss>
<ss>If I were speaking to them instead of to you, I would say to them, "You are the ones who are out of step with our society</ss>
<ss>You are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of the dream that is America</ss>
<ss>And this country, because of what it stands for, will not stand for your conduct</ss>
<ss>" My administration will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who, by violence or intimidation, would attempt to deny <NORP> their constitutional rights</ss>
<ss>Another kind of terror has recently plagued the city of Atlanta</ss>
<ss>Not long ago in a speech before the <ORG> I read the now famous "pajama letter" from <PERSON></ss>
<ss>If only my letters from children could all be as lighthearted as <PERSON>'s</ss>
<ss>Other letters are more poignant</ss>
<ss>When little girls in Atlanta write asking that I make things right so they won't be scared anymore, even a President of the United <ORG>s can feel a little helpless</ss>
<ss>We committed the resources of the <ORG> and a number of <ORG> agencies to help Mayor <PERSON></ss>
<ss>I appointed Vice President <PERSON> to head this <ORG> task force, and its work will continue until this tragic episode is over</ss>
<ss>Not counting manpower and equipment, we've provided <MONEY> to this cause</ss>
<ss>I know that all of us wish we could tell the children of Atlanta that they need no longer fear, and until we can say that, however, we will not be satisfied until those children can once again play safely in their school yards and parks</ss>
<ss>Our dialog must also include discussions on how we can best protect the rights and privileges of all our citizens</ss>
<ss>My administration will root out any case of government discrimination against minorities and uphold and enforce the laws that protect them</ss>
<ss>I emphasize that we will not retreat on the nation's commitment to equal treatment of all citizens</ss>
<ss>Now, that, in my view, is the primary responsibility of <ORG></ss>
<ss>The Attorney General is now carefully studying the decennial redistricting plans being submitted under the current <LAW></ss>
<ss>As soon as we have all the information there will be a decision regarding extension of the act</ss>
<ss>Until a decision is announced, you should know this: I regard voting as the most sacred right of free men and women</ss>
<ss>We have not sacrificed and fought and toiled to protect that right so that now we can sit back and permit a barrier to come between a secret ballot and any citizen who makes a choice to cast it</ss>
<ss>Nothing -- nothing will change that as long as I am in a position to uphold the <LAW> of the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, our dialog also will include tough and realistic questions about the role of <ORG> in the black community</ss>
<ss>I'm not satisfied with its results, and I don't think you are either</ss>
<ss>And the failures of the past have been particularly hard on the minority poor, because their hopes have failed as surely as the <ORG> programs that built those hopes</ss>
<ss>But I must not be the only one who questions about government policies</ss>
<ss>Can the black teenager who faces a staggering unemployment rate feel that government policies are a success? Can the black wage earner who sees more and more of his take-home pay shrinking because of government taxes feel satisfied? Can black parents say, despite a massive influx of <ORG> aid, that educational standards in our schools have improved appreciably? Can the women I saw on television recently -- whose family had been on welfare for three generations and who feared that her children might be the <ORDINAL> -- can she believe that current government policies will save her children from such a fate? We ask these tough questions, because we share your concerns about the future of the black community</ss>
<ss>We ask these questions, because the blacks of America should not be patronized as just one more voting bloc to be wooed and won</ss>
<ss>You are individuals as we all are</ss>
<ss>Some have special needs</ss>
<ss>I don't think <ORG> has met those needs</ss>
<ss>I've been listening to the specific needs of many people -- blacks, farmers, refugees, union members, women, small business men and women, and other groups -- they're commonly referred to as special-interest groups</ss>
<ss>Well, in reality they're all members of the interest group that I spoke of <DATE> I took the oath of office</ss>
<ss>They are the people of America</ss>
<ss>And I'm pleased to serve that special-interest group</ss>
<ss>The people of the inner cities will be represented by this administration every bit as much as the citizens of Flagstaff, Arizona, Ithaca, New York, or Dixon, Illinois, where I grew up</ss>
<ss>Anyone who becomes President realizes he must represent all the people of the land, not just those of a home <ORG> or a particular party</ss>
<ss>Nor can he be just President of those who voted for him</ss>
<ss>But it doesn't matter what groups we belong to, what area we live in, how much or how little we earn; the economy affects every single one of us regardless of our other interests and affiliations</ss>
<ss>We have proceeded full throttle on our economic recovery program, because a strong, growing economy without inflation is the surest, most equitable way to ease the pressures on all the segments of our society</ss>
<ss>The well-being of blacks, like the well-being of every other <NORP>, is linked directly to the health of the economy</ss>
<ss>For example, industries in which blacks had made sufficient gains in employment -- substantial gains, like autos and steel -- have been particularly hard hit</ss>
<ss>And "last hired, <ORDINAL> fired" is a familiar refrain to too many black workers</ss>
<ss>And I don't need to tell this group what inflation has done to those who can least afford it</ss>
<ss>A declining economy is a poisonous gas that claims its <ORDINAL> victims in poor neighborhoods, before floating out into the community at large</ss>
<ss>Therefore, in our national debate over budget and tax proposals, we shall not concede the moral high ground to the proponents of those policies that are responsible in the <ORDINAL> place for our economic mess -- a mess which has injured all <NORP></ss>
<ss>We will not concede the moral high ground to those who show more concern for <ORG> programs than they do for what really determines the income and financial health of blacks -- the nation's economy</ss>
<ss>Now, I know you've been told that my proposal for economic recovery is designed to discriminate against all who are economically deprived</ss>
<ss>Now, those who say that could be confused by the misstatements that have been made by some who are either ignorant of the facts or those who are practicing, for political reasons, pure demagoguery</ss>
<ss>Rebuilding America's economy is an absolute moral imperative if we're to avoid splitting this society in two with class against class</ss>
<ss>I do not intend to let America drift further toward economic segregation</ss>
<ss>We must change the economic direction of this country to bring more blacks into the mainstream, and we must do it now</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE>, before we had the equality we know <DATE>, <PERSON> wrote "<WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>" And he wrote: Oh, yes, I see  it plain America never was America to me</ss>
<ss>And yet I swear this oath --  America will be! America will be</ss>
<ss>That is the philosophy the people proclaimed in <DATE> election</ss>
<ss>America will be</ss>
<ss>And this time, she will be for everyone</ss>
<ss>Together, we can recreate for every citizen the same economic opportunities that we saw lift up a land of immigrant people, the kind of opportunities that have swept the hungry and the persecuted into the mainstream of our life since the <NORP> experiment began</ss>
<ss>To a number of black <NORP>, the U</ss>
<ss>S</ss>
<ss>economy has been something of an underground railroad; it has spirited them away from poverty to middle-class prosperity and beyond</ss>
<ss>But too many blacks still remain behind</ss>
<ss>A glance at the statistics will show that a large proportion of the black people have not found economic freedom</ss>
<ss><ORG>wide, for example, <PERCENT> of black families in <DATE> had money incomes under $<MONEY></ss>
<ss><PERSON>, who was known as the "conductor" of that earlier underground railroad, said on her <ORDINAL> escape from slavery, "When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person</ss>
<ss>There was such a glory over everything</ss>
<ss>" Even after <DATE> the beauty of her words is powerful</ss>
<ss>We can only imagine the soaring of her soul, what a feeling that must have been when she crossed into freedom and the physical and mental shackles fell from her person</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s glory was the glory of the <NORP> experience</ss>
<ss>It was a glory which had no color or religious preference or nationality</ss>
<ss>It was simply, eloquently, the universal thirst that all people have for freedom</ss>
<ss>Well, there are poor people in this country who should experience just such an elation if they found the economic freedom of a solid job, a productive job -- not one concocted by government and dependent on Washington winds; a real job where they could put in <DATE> work, complain about the boss, and then go home with confidence and self-respect</ss>
<ss>Why has this <ORG> been unable to fill such a basic, admirable need? The government can provide subsistence, yes, but it seldom moves people up the economic ladder</ss>
<ss>And as I've said before, you have to get on the ladder before you can move up on it</ss>
<ss>I believe many in Washington, over <DATE>, have been more dedicated to making needy people government dependent rather than independent</ss>
<ss>They've created a new kind of bondage, because regardless of how honest their intention in the beginning, those they set out to help soon became clients essential to the well-being of those who administered the programs</ss>
<ss>An honest program would be dedicated to making people independent, no longer in need of government assistance</ss>
<ss>But then what would happen to those who made a career of helping? Well, <NORP> have been very generous, with good intentions and <MONEY>, toward those they believed were living in hardship</ss>
<ss>And yet, in spite of the hopes, the government has never lived up to the dreams of poor people</ss>
<ss>Just as the Emancipation Proclamation freed black people <DATE>, <DATE> we need to declare an economic emancipation</ss>
<ss>I genuinely and deeply believe the economic package we've put forth will move us toward black economic freedom, because it's aimed at lifting an entire country and not just parts of it</ss>
<ss>There's a truth to the words spoken by <PERSON> that a rising tide lifts all boats</ss>
<ss>Yes, I know it's been said, "What about the fellow without a boat who can't swim?" Well, I believe <PERSON> figure of speech was referring to the benefits which accrue to all when the economy is flourishing</ss>
<ss>Now, much has been said and written-not all of it flattering -- about the savings I've proposed in the budget which were adopted by the <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>I can assure you that the budget savings we've advocated are much more equitable than the tremendous cuts in social programs, made by inflation and the declining economy, which can't find jobs for almost 8 million men and women who are unemployed</ss>
<ss>Those cuts are exacted without regard to need or age</ss>
<ss>Let me give some examples</ss>
<ss>In the prosperity of the <DATE>'s, an era of only a few <ORG> programs costing very little, the number of people living in poverty was reduced by <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>During the "stagflation" of the <DATE>'s with many <ORG> programs with huge budgets, the number living in poverty was reduced by <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>In the <DATE>'s black unemployment fell from <PERCENT> to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>In the <DATE>'s it increased from <PERCENT> to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>What is more, relative to the white unemployment rate, black unemployment fell more in the <DATE>'s but rose more in the <DATE>'s</ss>
<ss>The declining economy has cut black family income</ss>
<ss>From <DATE>, the median family income of blacks, after adjusting for inflation, rose at <PERCENT> per <DATE>, but from <DATE>, income actually dropped</ss>
<ss>Now, these are hard economic facts which are hard to take, because they show massive amounts of government aid and intervention have failed to produce the desired results</ss>
<ss>A strong economy returns the greatest good to the black population</ss>
<ss>It returns a benefit greater than that provided by specific <ORG> programs</ss>
<ss>By slowing the growth of government and by limiting the tax burden and thus stimulating investment, we will also be reducing inflation and unemployment</ss>
<ss>We will be creating jobs, nearly 3 million additional new jobs by <DATE></ss>
<ss>We will be aiding minority businesses, which have been particularly hard hit by the scarcity of capital and the prohibitive interest rates</ss>
<ss>And these concerns are what the bipartisan tax cut proposal currently before the <ORG> is all about</ss>
<ss>I said the other day in our conversation in <FAC> that the income a <DATE> or <DATE> -- I don't have the most recent figure -- for the black community was something like <MONEY></ss>
<ss>Now, in most neighborhoods what really brings prosperity is when the income of that neighborhood is then multiplied by turning over several times within that community</ss>
<ss>I must tell you that in the black communities in America the turnover is less than once before the dollars, those <MONEY>, go out into the community at large</ss>
<ss>And that has to be changed</ss>
<ss>In the convention <DATE> <PERSON> -- the one that I missed -- well, no, this was <EVENT>; I made that one -- <PERSON> said to the assembled delegates, "We must decide as a nation if we're to become prisoners of our past or possessors of an enlightened and progressive future</ss>
<ss>" Those are the very words I want to say to you <DATE></ss>
<ss>We cannot be tied to the old ways of solving our economic and racial problems</ss>
<ss>But it is time we looked to new answers and new ways of thinking that will accomplish the very ends the New Deal and <ORG> anticipated</ss>
<ss>We're not repealing the gains of black people</ss>
<ss>We're solidifying those gains and making them safe for your children and grandchildren</ss>
<ss>It's time that we found ways to make the <NORP> economic pie bigger instead of just cutting an ever smaller pie into more but smaller slices</ss>
<ss>It's time we welcomed those <NORP> into the circle of prosperity to let them share in the wonders of our society, and it's time to break the cycle of dependency that has become the legacy of so many <ORG> programs that no longer work -- indeed, some of which never did work</ss>
<ss>Let me give you an idea of how bountiful this famous economic pie could have been by now</ss>
<ss>If productivity had not stopped growing and then started downhill after <DATE>, the gross national product <DATE> would be <MONEY> bigger -- enough to balance the budget, cut personal and social security taxes in half, and still provide every <NORP> with an extra $<MONEY> in spending money</ss>
<ss>And all of this would have happened with the compliments of the private sector</ss>
<ss>Now, you wisely learned to harness <ORG> in the hard pull toward equality, and that was right, because guaranteeing equality of treatment is government's proper function</ss>
<ss>But as <DATE> of statistics I just read indicated, government is no longer the strong draft horse of minority progress, because it has attempted to do too many things it's not equipped to do</ss>
<ss>I ask you if it isn't time to hitch up a fresh horse to finish the task</ss>
<ss>Free enterprise is a powerful workhorse that can solve many problems of the black community that government alone can no longer solve</ss>
<ss>The black leadership of this <ORG> has shown tremendous courage, both physical and intellectual, and great creativity as it sought to bring equality to its people</ss>
<ss>You in this audience are the inheritors of that proud black heritage</ss>
<ss>You are the black leaders of <DATE>, and I believe you possess the very same courage and creativity</ss>
<ss>I ask you to use that courage and creativity to examine the challenges that are facing not just blacks but all of America</ss>
<ss>I ask you to question the status quo as your predecessors did and look for new and imaginative ways to overcome minority problems</ss>
<ss>I'm talking about the kind of courage and questioning your chairman, <PERSON>, showed in taking the heat for the <ORG>'s controversial <DATE> energy statement -- a statement which shook the elitists of our country back into the real world, at least for a time</ss>
<ss>What I'm asking you to consider requires not so much a leap of faith, but a realization that <ORG> alone is just not capable of doing the job we all want done for you or any other <NORP></ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, as the administration is free to turn attention from the economic program to other needs of America, we'll be advancing proposals on a number of issues of concern to this convention</ss>
<ss>The inner cities, for example, should be communities, neighborhoods, not warehouses of despair where children are bused out and ineffectual <ORG> funds are bused in</ss>
<ss>I believe that with the aid of commonsense government assistance and the use of free enterprise zones, with less reliance on busing and more reliance on better, basic education, and with an emphasis on local activism, such as you represent, communities can be reinvigorated</ss>
<ss>Certainly, we're all inspired by the wonderful example of <PERSON> in Chicago, the gallant lady who has the educational grit to make <PERSON> admirers out of inner-city children</ss>
<ss>She just proves to me what a friend of mine, Wilson <PERSON>, California's superintendent of education, used to say: "The concept that black children can't learn unless they're sitting among white children is utter and complete nonsense</ss>
<ss>" Now, Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was not suggesting that integration isn't a good and proper thing; it is</ss>
<ss>And it's good for all of us when it's brought about with commonsense and attention to what is best for the children</ss>
<ss>We plan to take a look, a comprehensive look, at the education of blacks from primary school upward and strengthen the base of black colleges, which are a sound educational investment</ss>
<ss>They are more than that</ss>
<ss>They're a proud tradition, a symbol of black determination and accomplishment, and I feel deeply they must be preserved</ss>
<ss>We've increased the share of <ORG> III funds spend on black colleges, and that trend will continue</ss>
<ss>We have equal concern for the black business leaders of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Minority business development, as I indicated earlier, is a key to black economic progress</ss>
<ss>Black-owned businesses are especially important in neighborhood economies where the dollars, as I said, spent have a beneficial multiplier effect</ss>
<ss>We want your input</ss>
<ss>I expect my domestic advisers to be in regular touch with you as our policies evolve</ss>
<ss>We may not always agree, but new ideas are often sparked by opinions clashing</ss>
<ss>I didn't come here <DATE> bearing the promises of government handouts, which others have brought and which you've rightly learned to mistrust</ss>
<ss>Instead, I ask you to join me to build a coalition for change</ss>
<ss><DATE> the famous call went forth, the call for a conference emphasizing the civil and political rights of blacks</ss>
<ss>And the result of that call, of course, was <ORG></ss>
<ss>Well, <DATE> let us issue a call for new perspectives on the economic challenges facing black <NORP></ss>
<ss>Let us issue a call for exciting programs to spring America forward toward <DATE>, an America full of new solutions to old problems</ss>
<ss>We will link hands to build an era where we can put fear behind us and hope in front of us</ss>
<ss>It can be an era in which programs are less important than opportunities</ss>
<ss>It can be an era where we all reach out in reconciliation instead of anger and dispute</ss>
<ss>In the war in Vietnam <DATE>, a live grenade fell among a group of <NORP> soldiers</ss>
<ss>They were frozen with horror knowing they were <TIME> away from death</ss>
<ss>Then one young soldier, a black, threw himself on the grenade, covering it with his helmet and his body</ss>
<ss>He died to save his comrades</ss>
<ss>Greater glory hath no man</ss>
<ss><ORG>ional Medal of Honor winner, posthumously presented, <PERSON> last whispered words were, "You have to care</ss>
<ss>" Let us care</ss>
<ss>Let us work to build a nation that is free of racism, full of opportunity, and determined to loosen the creative energies of every person of every race, of every station, to make a better life</ss>
<ss>It will be my honor to stand alongside you to answer this call</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>I'd intended to make some remarks about the problem of social security <TIME>, but the immediacy of congressional action on the tax program, a key component of our economic package, has to take priority</ss>
<ss>Let me just say, however, I've been deeply disturbed by the way those of you who are dependent on social security have been needlessly frightened by some of the inaccuracies which have been given wide circulation</ss>
<ss>It's true that the social security system has financial problems</ss>
<ss>It's also true that these financial problems have been building for <DATE>, and nothing has been done</ss>
<ss>I hope to address you on this entire subject in the near future</ss>
<ss>In the meantime, let me just say this: I stated during the campaign and I repeat now, I will not stand by and see those of you who are dependent on social security deprived of the benefits you've worked so hard to earn</ss>
<ss>I make that pledge to you as your President</ss>
<ss>You have no reason to be frightened</ss>
<ss>You will continue to receive your checks in the full amount due you</ss>
<ss>In any plan to restore fiscal integrity of social security, I personally will see that the plan will not be at the expense of you who are now dependent on your <DATE> social security checks</ss>
<ss>Now, let us turn to the business at hand</ss>
<ss>It's been <DATE> since I <ORDINAL> reported to you on the state of the nation's economy</ss>
<ss>I'm afraid my message that night was grim and disturbing</ss>
<ss>I remember telling you we were in the worst economic mess since <EVENT></ss>
<ss>Prices were continuing to spiral upward, unemployment was reaching intolerable levels, and all because government was too big and spent too much of our money</ss>
<ss>We're still not out of the woods, but we've made a start</ss>
<ss>And we've certainly surprised those longtime and somewhat cynical observers of the Washington scene, who looked, listened, and said, "It can never be done; Washington will never change its spending habits</ss>
<ss>" Well, something very exciting has been happening here in Washington, and you're responsible</ss>
<ss>Your voices have been heard -- millions of you, <NORP>, <NORP>, and <NORP>, from every profession, trade and line of work, and from every part of this land</ss>
<ss>You sent a message that you wanted a new beginning</ss>
<ss>You wanted to change one little, two little word -- two letter word, I should say</ss>
<ss>It doesn't sound like much, but it sure can make a difference changing "by government," "control by government" to "control of government</ss>
<ss>" In that earlier broadcast, you'll recall I proposed a program to drastically cut back government spending in the <DATE> budget, which begins <DATE>, and to continue cutting in <DATE> and <DATE> budgets</ss>
<ss>Along with this I suggested an across-the-board tax cut, spread over <DATE>, and the elimination of unnecessary regulations which were adding billions to the cost of things we buy</ss>
<ss>All the lobbying, the organized demonstrations, and the cries of protest by those whose way of life depends on maintaining government's wasteful ways were no match for your voices, which were heard loud and clear in these marble halls of government</ss>
<ss>And you made history with your telegrams, your letters, your phone calls and, yes, personal visits to talk to your elected representatives</ss>
<ss>You reaffirmed the mandate you delivered in the election <DATE> -- a mandate that called for an end to government policies that sent prices and mortgage rates skyrocketing while millions of <NORP> went jobless</ss>
<ss>Because of what you did, <NORP> and <NORP> in the <ORG> came together and passed the most sweeping cutbacks in the history of the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>Right now, Members of the <ORG> and <ORG> are meeting in a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two budget-cutting bills passed by the <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>When they finish, all <NORP> will benefit from savings of <MONEY> in reduced government costs over just <DATE></ss>
<ss>And that doesn't include the additional savings from the hundreds of burdensome regulations already cancelled or facing cancellation</ss>
<ss>For 19 out of <DATE>, <ORG> has spent more than it took in</ss>
<ss>There will be another large deficit in <DATE> which ends <DATE>, but with our program in place, it won't be quite as big as it might have been</ss>
<ss>And starting <DATE>, the deficits will get smaller until in <DATE> the budget can be balanced</ss>
<ss>And we hope we can begin whittling at that <MONEY> debt that hangs over the future of our children</ss>
<ss>Now, so far, I've been talking about only one part of our program for economic recovery-the budget-cutting part</ss>
<ss>I don't minimize its importance</ss>
<ss>Just the fact that <NORP> and <NORP> could work together as they have, proving the strength of our system, has created an optimism in our land</ss>
<ss>The rate of inflation is no longer in double-digit figures</ss>
<ss>The dollar has regained strength in the international money markets, and businessmen and investors are making decisions with regard to industrial development, modernization and expansion-all of this based on anticipation of our program being adopted and put into operation</ss>
<ss>A recent poll shows that where <DATE> <PERCENT> of our people believed things would get better, today <PERCENT> believe they will</ss>
<ss>To justify their faith, we must deliver the other part of our program</ss>
<ss>Our economic package is a closely knit, carefully constructed plan to restore America's economic strength and put our nation back on the road to prosperity</ss>
<ss>Each part of this package is vital</ss>
<ss>It cannot be considered piecemeal</ss>
<ss>It was proposed as a package, and it has been supported as such by the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>Only if the <ORG> passes all of its major components does it have any real chance of success</ss>
<ss>This is absolutely essential if we are to provide incentives and make capital available for the increased productivity required to provide real, permanent jobs for our people</ss>
<ss>And let us not forget that the rest of the world is watching America carefully to see how we'll act at this critical moment</ss>
<ss>I have recently returned from a summit meeting with world leaders in Ottawa, Canada, and the message I heard from them was quite clear</ss>
<ss>Our allies depend on a strong and economically sound America</ss>
<ss>And they're watching events in this country, particularly those surrounding our program for economic recovery, with close attention and great hopes</ss>
<ss>In short, the best way to have a strong foreign policy abroad is to have a strong economy at home</ss>
<ss><DATE> after <DATE>, <ORG> will begin debate on two tax bills</ss>
<ss>And once again, they need to hear from you</ss>
<ss>I know that doesn't give you much time, but a great deal is at stake</ss>
<ss><DATE> I was visited here in the office by a <NORP> <ORG>man from one of our southern States</ss>
<ss>He'd been back in his district</ss>
<ss>And <DATE> one of his constituents asked him where he stood on our economic recovery program -- I outlined that program in an earlier broadcast-particularly the tax cut</ss>
<ss>Well, the <ORG>man, who happens to be a strong leader in support of our program, replied at some length with a discussion of the technical points involved, but he also mentioned a few reservations he had on certain points</ss>
<ss>The constituent, a farmer, listened politely until he'd finished, and then he said, "Don't give me an essay</ss>
<ss>What I want to know is are you for 'im or agin 'im?" Well, I appreciate the gentleman's support and suggest his question is a message your own representatives should hear</ss>
<ss>Let me add, those representatives honestly and sincerely want to know your feelings</ss>
<ss>They get plenty of input from the special interest groups</ss>
<ss>They'd like to hear from their home folks</ss>
<ss>Now, let me explain what the situation is and what's at issue</ss>
<ss>With our budget cuts, we've presented a complete program of reduction in tax rates</ss>
<ss>Again, our purpose was to provide incentive for the individual, incentives for business to encourage production and hiring of the unemployed, and to free up money for investment</ss>
<ss>Our bill calls for a 5-percent reduction in the income tax rates by <DATE>, a 10-percent reduction beginning <DATE>, and another 10-percent cut <DATE>, a 25-percent total reduction over <DATE></ss>
<ss>But then to ensure the tax cut is permanent, we call for indexing the tax rates in <DATE>, which means adjusting them for inflation</ss>
<ss>As it is now, if you get a cost-of-living raise that's intended to keep you even with inflation, you find that the increase in the number of dollars you get may very likely move you into a higher tax bracket, and you wind up poorer than you would</ss>
<ss>This is called bracket creep</ss>
<ss>Bracket creep is an insidious tax</ss>
<ss>Let me give an example</ss>
<ss>If you earned $<MONEY> a year in <DATE>, by <DATE> you had to earn $<MONEY> just to stay even with inflation</ss>
<ss>But that's before taxes</ss>
<ss>Come <DATE>, you'll find your tax rates have increased <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Now, if you've been wondering why you don't seem as well-off as you were <DATE> back, it's because government makes a profit on inflation</ss>
<ss>It gets an automatic tax increase without having to vote on it</ss>
<ss>We intend to stop that</ss>
<ss>Time won't allow me to explain every detail</ss>
<ss>But our bill includes just about everything to help the economy</ss>
<ss>We reduce the marriage penalty, that unfair tax that has a working husband and wife pay more tax than if they were single</ss>
<ss>We increase the exemption on the inheritance or estate tax to $<MONEY>, so that farmers and family-owned businesses don't have to sell the farm or store in the event of death just to pay the taxes</ss>
<ss>Most important, we wipe out the tax entirely for a surviving spouse</ss>
<ss>No longer, for example, will a widow have to sell the family source of income to pay a tax on her husband's death</ss>
<ss>There are deductions to encourage investment and savings</ss>
<ss>Business gets realistic depreciation on equipment and machinery</ss>
<ss>And there are tax breaks for small and independent businesses which create <PERCENT> of all our new jobs</ss>
<ss>This bill also provides major credits to the research and development industry</ss>
<ss>These credits will help spark the high technology breakthroughs that are so critical to America's economic leadership in the world</ss>
<ss>There are also added incentives for small businesses, including a provision that will lift much of the burden of costly paperwork that government has imposed on small business</ss>
<ss>In addition, there's short-term but substantial assistance for the hard pressed thrift industry, as well as reductions in oil taxes that will benefit new or independent oil producers and move our nation a step closer to energy self-sufficiency</ss>
<ss>Our bill is, in short, the <ORDINAL> real tax cut for everyone in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, when I <ORDINAL> proposed this -- incidentally, it has now become a bipartisan measure coauthored by <NORP> <PERSON> and <NORP> <PERSON> -- the <NORP> leadership said a tax cut was out of the question</ss>
<ss>It would be wildly inflationary</ss>
<ss>And that was before my inauguration</ss>
<ss>And then your voices began to he heard and suddenly, in <DATE>, the leadership discovered that, well, a 1-year tax cut was feasible</ss>
<ss>Well, we kept on pushing our 3-year tax cut and by <DATE>, the opposition found that a 2-year tax cut might work</ss>
<ss>Now it's <DATE>, and they find they could even go for <DATE> cut provided there was a trigger arrangement that would only allow it to go into effect if certain economic goals had been met by <DATE></ss>
<ss>But by holding the people's tax reduction hostage to future economic events, they will eliminate the people's ability to plan ahead</ss>
<ss>Shopkeepers, farmers, and individuals will be denied the certainty they must have to begin saving or investing more of their money</ss>
<ss>And encouraging more savings and investment is precisely what we need now to rebuild our economy</ss>
<ss>There's also a little sleight of hand in that trigger mechanism</ss>
<ss>You see, their bill, the committee bill, ensures that the <DATE> deficit will be <MONEY> greater than their own trigger requires</ss>
<ss>As it stands now, the design of their own bill will not meet the trigger they've put in; therefore, <DATE> tax cut will automatically never take place</ss>
<ss>If I could paraphrase a well-known statement by <PERSON> that he had never met a man he didn't like, I'm afraid we have some people around here who never met a tax they didn't hike</ss>
<ss>Their tax proposal, similar in a number of ways to ours but differing in some very vital parts, was passed out of <ORG>, and from now on I'll refer to it as the committee bill and ours as the bipartisan bill</ss>
<ss>They'll be the bills taken up <DATE></ss>
<ss>The majority leadership claims theirs gives a greater break to the worker than ours, and it does -- that is, if your're only planning to live <DATE></ss>
<ss>The plain truth is, our choice is not between two plans to reduce taxes; it's between a tax cut or a tax increase</ss>
<ss>There is now built into our present system, including payroll social security taxes and the bracket creep I've mentioned, a 22-percent tax increase over <DATE></ss>
<ss>The committee bill offers a 15-percent cut over <DATE>; our bipartisan bill gives a 25-percent reduction over <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, as you can see by this chart, there is the 22-percent tax increase</ss>
<ss>Their cut is below that line</ss>
<ss>But ours wipes out that increase and with a little to spare</ss>
<ss>And there it is, as you can see</ss>
<ss>The red column -- that is the 15-percent tax cut, and it still leaves you with an increase</ss>
<ss>The green column is our bipartisan bill which wipes out the tax increase and gives you an ongoing cut</ss>
<ss>Incidentally, their claim that cutting taxes for individuals for <DATE> is risky, rings a little hollow when you realize that their bill calls for business tax cuts <DATE> for <DATE></ss>
<ss>It rings even more hollow when you consider the fact the majority leadership routinely endorses <ORG> spending bills that project years into the future, but objects to a tax bill that will return your money over a 3-year period</ss>
<ss>Now, here is another chart which illustrates what I said about their giving a better break if you only intend to live for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Their tax cut, so called, is the dotted line</ss>
<ss>Ours is the solid line</ss>
<ss>As you can see, in an earning bracket of $<MONEY>, their tax cut is slightly more generous than ours for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Then, as you can see, their tax bill, the dotted line, starts going up and up and up</ss>
<ss>On the other hand, in our bipartisan tax bill, the solid line, our tax cut keeps on going down, and then stays down permanently</ss>
<ss>This is true of all earning brackets -- not just the $<MONEY> level that I've used as an example -- from the lowest to the highest</ss>
<ss>This red space between the two lines is the tax money that will remain in your pockets if our bill passes; and it's the amount that will leave your pockets if their tax bill is passed</ss>
<ss>Now, I take no pleasure in saying this, but those who will seek to defeat our <ORG> bipartisan bill as debate begins <DATE> are the ones who have given us five "tax cuts" in <DATE></ss>
<ss>But, our taxes went up <MONEY> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The lines on these charts say a lot about who's really fighting for whom</ss>
<ss>On the one hand, you see a genuine and lasting commitment to the future of working <NORP>; on the other, just another empty promise</ss>
<ss>Those of us in the bipartisan coalition want to give this economy and the future of this Nation back to the people, because putting people <ORDINAL> has always been America's secret weapon</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> majority leadership seems less concerned about protecting your family budget than with spending more on the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>Our bipartisan tax bill targets three-quarters of its tax relief to middle-income wage earners who presently pay almost three-quarter of the total income tax</ss>
<ss>It also then indexes the tax brackets to ensure that you can keep that tax reduction in <DATE></ss>
<ss>There also is, as I said, estate tax relief that will keep family farms and family-owned businesses in the family, and there are provisions for personal retirement plans and individual savings accounts</ss>
<ss>Because our bipartisan bill is so clearly drawn and broadly based, it provides the kind of predictability and certainty that the financial segments of our society need to make investment decisions that stimulate productivity and make our economy grow</ss>
<ss>Even more important, if the tax cut goes to you, the <NORP> people, in <DATE>, that money returned to you won't be available to the <ORG> to spend, and that, in my view, is what this whole controversy comes down to</ss>
<ss>Are you entitled to the fruits of your own labor or does government have some presumptive right to spend and spend and spend? I'm also convinced our business tax cut is superior to theirs because it's more equitable, and it will do a much better job promoting the surge in investment we so badly need to rebuild our industrial base</ss>
<ss>There's something else I want to tell you</ss>
<ss>Our bipartisan coalition worked out a tax bill we felt would provide incentive and stimulate productivity, thus reducing inflation and providing jobs for the unemployed</ss>
<ss>That was our only goal</ss>
<ss>Our opponents in the beginning didn't want a tax bill at all</ss>
<ss>So what is the purpose behind their change of heart? They've put a tax program together for one reason only: to provide themselves with a political victory</ss>
<ss>Never mind that it won't solve the economic problems confronting our country</ss>
<ss>Never mind that it won't get the wheels of industry turning again or eliminate the inflation which is eating us alive</ss>
<ss>This is not the time for political fun and games</ss>
<ss>This is the time for a new beginning</ss>
<ss>I ask you now to put aside any feelings of frustration or helplessness about our political institutions and join me in this dramatic but responsible plan to reduce the enormous burden of <ORG> taxation on you and your family</ss>
<ss>During <DATE> many of you have asked what can you do to help make America strong again</ss>
<ss>I urge you again to contact your Senators and <ORG>men</ss>
<ss>Tell them of your support for this bipartisan proposal</ss>
<ss>Tell them you believe this is an unequalled opportunity to help return America to prosperity and make government again the servant of the people</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> the <ORG> will stand at the fork of two roads</ss>
<ss>One road is all too familiar to us</ss>
<ss>It leads ultimately to higher taxes</ss>
<ss>It merely brings us full circle back to the source of our economic problems, where the government decides that it knows better than you what should be done with your earnings and, in fact, how you should conduct your life</ss>
<ss>The other road promises to renew the <NORP> spirit</ss>
<ss>It's a road of hope and opportunity</ss>
<ss>It places the direction of your life back in your hands where it belongs</ss>
<ss>I've not taken your time <TIME> merely to ask you to trust me</ss>
<ss>Instead, I ask you to trust yourselves</ss>
<ss>That's what America is all about</ss>
<ss>Our struggle for nationhood, our unrelenting fight for freedom, our very existence -- these have all rested on the assurance that you must be free to shape your life as you are best able to, that no one can stop you from reaching higher or take from you the creativity that has made America the envy of mankind</ss>
<ss>One road is timid and fearful; the other bold and hopeful</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, we've done so much and have come so far</ss>
<ss>It's been the power of millions of people like you who have determined that we will make America great again</ss>
<ss>You have made the difference up to now</ss>
<ss>You will make the difference again</ss>
<ss>Let us not stop now</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>God bless you, and good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss><TIME> at <DATE> the union representing those who man America's air traffic control facilities called a strike</ss>
<ss>This was the culmination of <DATE> of negotiations between <ORG> and the union</ss>
<ss>At one point in these negotiations agreement was reached and signed by both sides, granting a <MONEY> increase in salaries and benefits</ss>
<ss>This is twice what other government employees can expect</ss>
<ss>It was granted in recognition of the difficulties inherent in the work these people perform</ss>
<ss>Now, however, the union demands are 17 times what had been agreed to -- <MONEY></ss>
<ss>This would impose a tax burden on their fellow citizens which is unacceptable</ss>
<ss>I would like to thank the supervisors and controllers who are on the job <DATE>, helping to get the nation's air system operating safely</ss>
<ss>In the New York area, for example, four supervisors were scheduled to report for work, and 17 additionally volunteered</ss>
<ss>At <FAC> a traffic controller told a newsperson he had resigned from the union and reported to work because, "How can I ask my kids to obey the law if I don't?" This is a great tribute to America</ss>
<ss>Let me make one thing plain</ss>
<ss>I respect the right of workers in the private sector to strike</ss>
<ss>Indeed, as president of my own union, I led the <ORDINAL> strike ever called by that union</ss>
<ss>I guess I'm maybe the <ORDINAL> one to ever hold this office who is a lifetime member of <ORG></ss>
<ss>But we cannot compare labor-management relations in the private sector with government</ss>
<ss>Government cannot close down the assembly line</ss>
<ss>It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government's reason for being</ss>
<ss>It was in recognition of this that the <ORG> passed a law forbidding strikes by government employees against the public safety</ss>
<ss>Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees, a sworn affidavit, when they accepted their jobs: "I am not participating in any strike against the Government of the United States or any agency thereof, and I will not so participate while an employee of the Government of the United States or any agency thereof</ss>
<ss>" It is for this reason that I must tell those who fail to report for duty <TIME> they are in violation of the law, and if they do not report for work within <TIME>, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated</ss>
<ss>Well, I have some people around here, and maybe I should refer that question to the Attorney General</ss>
<ss>I told you what I think should be done</ss>
<ss>They're terminated</ss>
<ss>If any situation should arise that would require my presence here, naturally I will do that</ss>
<ss>So, that will be a decision that awaits what's going to happen</ss>
<ss>May I just -- because I have to be back in there for another appointment -- may I just say one thing on top of this? With all this talk of penalties and everything else, I hope that you'll emphasize, again, the possibility of termination, because I believe that there are a great many of those people -- and they're fine people -- who have been swept up in this and probably have not really considered the result -- the fact that they had taken an oath, the fact that this is now in violation of the law, as that one supervisor referred to with regard to his children</ss>
<ss>And I am hoping that they will in a sense remove themselves from the lawbreaker situation by returning to their posts</ss>
<ss>I have no way to know whether this had been conveyed to them by their union leaders, who had been informed that this would be the result of a strike</ss>
<ss><TIME></ss>
<ss>What lesser action can there be? The law is very explicit</ss>
<ss>They are violating the law</ss>
<ss>And as I say, we called this to the attention of their leadership</ss>
<ss>Whether this was conveyed to the membership before they voted to strike, I don't know</ss>
<ss>But this is one of the reasons why there can be no further negotiation while this situation continues</ss>
<ss>You can't sit and negotiate with a union that's in violation of the law</ss>
<ss>And their oath</ss>
<ss>Well, that again is not for me to answer</ss>
<ss>As far as the military personnel are concerned, they are going to fundamentally be backup to the supervisory personnel</ss>
<ss>We had 150 on the job, supposedly, <TIME></ss>
<ss>We're going to increase that to somewhere between 700 and 850</ss>
<ss>?>                            ?></ss>
<ss>Officers, ladies and gentlemen of <ORG> and, as of a very short time ago, fellow members: Back in <DATE> while in the hospital I had, as you can readily understand, a lot of time for reflection</ss>
<ss>And <DATE> I decided to send a personal, handwritten letter to <NORP> <PERSON> <PERSON> reminding him that we had met <DATE> in San Clemente, California, as he and <PERSON> <PERSON> were concluding a series of meetings that had brought hope to all the world</ss>
<ss>Never had peace and good will seemed closer at hand</ss>
<ss>I'd like to read you a few paragraphs from that letter</ss>
<ss>"Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>: When we met, I asked if you were aware that the hopes and aspirations of millions of people throughout the world were dependent on the decisions that would be reached in those meetings</ss>
<ss>You took my hand in both of yours and assured me that you were aware of that and that you were dedicated with all your heart and soul and mind to fulfilling those hopes and dreams</ss>
<ss>" I went on in my letter to say: "The people of the world still share that hope</ss>
<ss>Indeed, the peoples of the world, despite differences in racial and ethnic origin, have very much in common</ss>
<ss>They want the dignity of having some control over their individual lives, their destiny</ss>
<ss>They want to work at the craft or trade of their own choosing and to be fairly rewarded</ss>
<ss>They want to raise their families in peace without harming anyone or suffering harm themselves</ss>
<ss>Government exists for their convenience, not the other way around</ss>
<ss>"If they are incapable, as some would have us believe, of self-government, then where among them do we find any who are capable of governing others? "Is it possible that we have permitted ideology, political and economic philosophies, and governmental policies to keep us from considering the very real, everyday problems of our peoples? Will the average <NORP> family be better off or even aware that the <NORP> Union has imposed a government of its own choice on the people of Afghanistan? Is life better for the people of Cuba because the <NORP> military dictate who shall govern the people of Angola? "It is often implied that such things have been made necessary because of territorial ambitions of the United States; that we have imperialistic designs, and thus constitute a threat to your own security and that of the newly emerging nations</ss>
<ss>Not only is there no evidence to support such a charge, there is solid evidence that the United States, when it could have dominated the world with no risk to itself, made no effort whatsoever to do so</ss>
<ss>"When <EVENT> ended, the United States had the only undamaged industrial power in the world</ss>
<ss>Our military might was at its peak, and we alone had the ultimate weapon, the nuclear weapon, with the unquestioned ability to deliver it anywhere in the world</ss>
<ss>If we had sought world domination then, who could have opposed us? "But the United States followed a different course, one unique in all the history of mankind</ss>
<ss>We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war-ravished economies of the world, including those of the nations who had been our enemies</ss>
<ss>May I say, there is absolutely no substance to charges that the United States is guilty of imperialism or attempts to impose its will on other countries, by use of force</ss>
<ss>" I continued my letter by saying -- or concluded my letter, I should say -- by saying, "Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, should we not be concerned with eliminating the obstacles which prevent our people, those you and I represent, from achieving their most cherished goals?" Well, it's in the same spirit that I want to speak <DATE> to this audience and the people of the world about America's program for peace and the coming negotiations which begin <DATE> in Geneva, Switzerland</ss>
<ss>Specifically, I want to present our program for preserving peace in <LOC> and our wider program for arms control</ss>
<ss>Twice in my lifetime, I have seen the peoples of <LOC> plunged into the tragedy of war</ss>
<ss>Twice in my lifetime, <LOC> has suffered destruction and military occupation in wars that statesmen proved powerless to prevent, soldiers unable to contain, and ordinary citizens unable to escape</ss>
<ss>And twice in my lifetime, young <NORP> have bled their lives into the soil of those battlefields not to enrich or enlarge our domain, but to restore the peace and independence of our friends and <ORG></ss>
<ss>All of us who lived through those troubled times share a common resolve that they must never come again</ss>
<ss>And most of us share a common appreciation of <ORG> that has made a peaceful, free, and prosperous <LOC> in the post-war era possible</ss>
<ss>But <DATE>, a new generation is emerging on both sides of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Its members were not present at the creation of <ORG></ss>
<ss>Many of them don't fully understand its roots in defending freedom and rebuilding a war-torn continent</ss>
<ss>Some young people question why we need weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, to deter war and to assure peaceful development</ss>
<ss>They fear that the accumulation of weapons itself may lead to conflagration</ss>
<ss>Some even propose unilateral disarmament</ss>
<ss>I understand their concerns</ss>
<ss>Their questions deserve to be answered</ss>
<ss>But we have an obligation to answer their questions on the basis of judgment and reason and experience</ss>
<ss>Our policies have resulted in the longest <NORP> peace in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Wouldn't a rash departure from these policies, as some now suggest, endanger that peace? From its founding, <ORG> has preserved the peace through unity, deterrence, and dialog</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we and our <ORG> have stood united by the firm commitment that an attack upon any one of us would be considered an attack upon us all</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we and our <ORG> have deterred aggression by maintaining forces strong enough to ensure that any aggressor would lose more from an attack than he could possibly gain</ss>
<ss>And <ORDINAL>, we and our <ORG> have engaged the <NORP> in a dialog about mutual restraint and arms limitations, hoping to reduce the risk of war and the burden of armaments and to lower the barriers that divide <LOC> from <LOC></ss>
<ss>These three elements of our policy have preserved the peace in <LOC> for more than a <ORDINAL> of a century</ss>
<ss>They can preserve it for generations to come, so long as we pursue them with sufficient will and vigor</ss>
<ss><DATE>, I wish to reaffirm America's commitment to <ORG> and our resolve to sustain the peace</ss>
<ss>And from my conversations with allied leaders, I know that they also remain true to this tried and proven course</ss>
<ss><ORG>'s policy of peace is based on restraint and balance</ss>
<ss>No <ORG> weapons, conventional or nuclear, will ever be used in <LOC> except in response to attack</ss>
<ss><ORG>'s defense plans have been responsible and restrained</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> remain strong, united, and resolute</ss>
<ss>But the momentum of the continuing <NORP> military buildup threatens both the conventional and the nuclear balance</ss>
<ss>Consider the facts</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, the United States reduced the size of its <ORG> and decreased its military spending</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> steadily increased the number of men under arms</ss>
<ss>They now number more than double those of the United States</ss>
<ss>Over the same period, the <NORP> expanded their real military spending by about one-<ORDINAL></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union increased its inventory of tanks to some 50,000, compared to our 11,000</ss>
<ss>Historically a land power, they transformed their navy from a coastal defense force to an open ocean fleet, while the United States, a sea power with transoceanic alliances, cut its fleet in half</ss>
<ss>During a period when <ORG> deployed no new intermediate-range nuclear missiles and actually withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads, the <NORP> Union deployed more than 750 nuclear warheads on the new SS20 missiles alone</ss>
<ss>Our response to this relentless buildup of <NORP> military power has been restrained but firm</ss>
<ss>We have made decisions to strengthen all three legs of the strategic triad: sea-, land-, and air-based</ss>
<ss>We have proposed a defense program in the United States for <DATE> which will remedy the neglect of <DATE> and restore the eroding balance on which our security depends</ss>
<ss>I would like to discuss more specifically the growing threat to <LOC> which is posed by the continuing deployment of certain <NORP> intermediate-range nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union has three different type such missile systems: the SS20, the SS-4, and the SS-5, all with the range capable of reaching virtually all of <LOC></ss>
<ss>There are other <NORP> weapon systems which also represent a major threat</ss>
<ss>Now, the only answer to these systems is a comparable threat to <NORP> threats, to <NORP> targets; in other words, a deterrent preventing the use of these <NORP> weapons by the counterthreat of a like response against their own territory</ss>
<ss>At present, however, there is no equivalent deterrent to these <NORP> intermediate missiles</ss>
<ss>And the <NORP> continue to add one new SS-20 <DATE></ss>
<ss>To counter this, the <ORG> agreed in <DATE>, as part of a two-track decision, to deploy as a deterrent land-based cruise missiles and <NORP> missiles capable of reaching targets in the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>These missiles are to be deployed in several countries of <LOC></ss>
<ss>This relatively limited force in no way serves as a substitute for the much larger strategic umbrella spread over our <ORG></ss>
<ss>Rather, it provides a vital link between conventional shorter-range nuclear forces in <LOC> and intercontinental forces in the United States</ss>
<ss>Deployment of these systems will demonstrate to the <NORP> Union that this link cannot be broken</ss>
<ss>Deterring war depends on the perceived ability of our forces to perform effectively</ss>
<ss>The more effective our forces are, the less likely it is that we'll have to use them</ss>
<ss>So, we and our allies are proceeding to modernize <ORG>'s nuclear forces of intermediate range to meet increased <NORP> deployments of nuclear systems threatening <LOC></ss>
<ss>Let me turn now to our hopes for arms control negotiations</ss>
<ss>There's a tendency to make this entire subject overly complex</ss>
<ss>I want to be clear and concise</ss>
<ss>I told you of the letter I wrote to <PERSON> <PERSON> <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, I've just sent another message to the <NORP> leadership</ss>
<ss>It's a simple, straightforward, yet, historic message</ss>
<ss>The United States proposes the mutual reduction of conventional intermediate-range nuclear and strategic forces</ss>
<ss>Specifically, I have proposed a four-point agenda to achieve this objective in my letter to <PERSON> <PERSON></ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> and most important point concerns the Geneva negotiations</ss>
<ss>As part of the <DATE> two-track decision, <ORG> made a commitment to seek arms control negotiations with the <NORP> Union on intermediate range nuclear forces</ss>
<ss>The United States has been preparing for these negotiations through close consultation with our <ORG> partners</ss>
<ss>We're now ready to set forth our proposal</ss>
<ss>I have informed <PERSON> <PERSON> that when our delegation travels to the negotiations on intermediate range, land-based nuclear missiles in Geneva on <DATE>, my representatives will present the following proposal: The United States is prepared to cancel its deployment of <NORP> and ground-launch cruise missiles if the <NORP> will dismantle their SS-20, SS-4, and SS-5 missiles</ss>
<ss>This would be an historic step</ss>
<ss>With <NORP> agreement, we could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hangs over the people of <LOC></ss>
<ss>This, like the <ORDINAL> footstep on the <PERSON>, would be a giant step for mankind</ss>
<ss>Now, we intend to negotiate in good faith and go to Geneva willing to listen to and consider the proposals of our <NORP> counterparts, but let me call to your attention the background against which our proposal is made</ss>
<ss>During <DATE> while the United States deployed no new intermediate-range missiles and withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads from <LOC>, the <NORP> Union deployed 750 warheads on mobile, accurate ballistic missiles</ss>
<ss>They now have 1,100 warheads on the <ORG>, <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>And the United States has no comparable missiles</ss>
<ss>Indeed, the United States dismantled the last such missile in <LOC> over <DATE></ss>
<ss>As we look to the future of the negotiations, it's also important to address certain <NORP> claims, which left unrefuted could become critical barriers to real progress in arms control</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> assert that a balance of intermediate range nuclear forces already exists</ss>
<ss>That assertion is wrong</ss>
<ss>By any objective measure, as this chart indicates, the <NORP> Union has developed an increasingly overwhelming advantage</ss>
<ss>They now enjoy a superiority on the order of six to one</ss>
<ss>The red is the <NORP> buildup; the blue is our own</ss>
<ss>That is <DATE>, and that is <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, <NORP> spokesmen have suggested that moving their <ORG> behind <LOC> will remove the threat to <LOC></ss>
<ss>Well, as this map demonstrates, the <ORG>, even if deployed behind the Urals, will have a range that puts almost all of <LOC>-the great cities-Rome, Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin, and so many more-all of <LOC>, all of <LOC>, all of northern <LOC>, all within range of these missiles which, incidentally, are mobile and can be moved on shorter notice</ss>
<ss>These little images mark the present location which would give them a range clear out into the <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> proposal that I've made to <PERSON> <PERSON> concerns strategic weapons</ss>
<ss>The United States proposes to open negotiations on strategic arms as soon as possible <DATE></ss>
<ss>I have instructed Secretary <PERSON> to discuss the timing of such meetings with <NORP> representatives</ss>
<ss>Substance, however, is far more important than timing</ss>
<ss>As our proposal for the Geneva talks <DATE> illustrates, we can make proposals for genuinely serious reductions, but only if we take the time to prepare carefully</ss>
<ss>The United States has been preparing carefully for resumption of strategic arms negotiations because we don't want a repetition of past disappointments</ss>
<ss>We don't want an arms control process that sends hopes soaring only to end in dashed expectations</ss>
<ss>Now, I have informed <PERSON> <PERSON> that we will seek to negotiate substantial reductions in nuclear arms which would result in levels that are equal and verifiable</ss>
<ss>Our approach to verification will be to emphasize openness and creativity, rather than the secrecy and suspicion which have undermined confidence in arms control in the past</ss>
<ss>While we can hope to benefit from work done over <DATE> in strategic arms negotiations, let us agree to do more than simply begin where these previous efforts left off</ss>
<ss>We can and should attempt major qualitative and quantitative progress</ss>
<ss>Only such progress can fulfill the hopes of our own people and the rest of the world</ss>
<ss>And let us see how far we can go in achieving truly substantial reductions in our strategic arsenals</ss>
<ss>To symbolize this fundamental change in direction, we will call these negotiations <ORG>-Strategic Arms Reduction Talks</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> proposal I've made to the <NORP> Union is that we act to achieve equality at lower levels of conventional forces in <LOC></ss>
<ss>The defense needs of the <NORP> Union hardly call for maintaining more combat divisions in <LOC> Germany <DATE> than were in the whole <ORG> invasion force that landed in Normandy on <DATE></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union could make no more convincing contribution to peace in <LOC>, and in the world, than by agreeing to reduce its conventional forces significantly and constrain the potential for sudden aggression</ss>
<ss>Finally, I have pointed out to <PERSON> <PERSON> that to maintain peace we must reduce the risks of surprise attack and the chance of war arising out of uncertainty or miscalculation</ss>
<ss>I am renewing our proposal for a conference to develop effective measures that would reduce these dangers</ss>
<ss>At the current Madrid meeting of <ORG> in <LOC>, we're laying the foundation for a <LOC>ern-proposed conference on disarmament in <LOC></ss>
<ss>This conference would discuss new measures to enhance stability and security in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Agreement in this conference is within reach</ss>
<ss>I urge the <NORP> Union to join us and many other nations who are ready to launch this important enterprise</ss>
<ss>All of these proposals are based on the same fair-minded principles-substantial, militarily significant reduction in forces, equal ceilings for similar types of forces, and adequate provisions for verification</ss>
<ss>My administration, our country, and I are committed to achieving arms reductions agreements based on these principles</ss>
<ss><DATE> I have outlined the kinds of bold, equitable proposals which the world expects of us</ss>
<ss>But we cannot reduce arms unilaterally</ss>
<ss>Success can only come if the <NORP> Union will share our commitment, if it will demonstrate that its often-repeated professions of concern for peace will be matched by positive action</ss>
<ss>Preservation of peace in <LOC> and the pursuit of arms reduction talks are of fundamental importance</ss>
<ss>But we must also help to bring peace and security to regions now torn by conflict, external intervention, and war</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> concept of peace goes well beyond the absence of war</ss>
<ss>We foresee a flowering of economic growth and individual liberty in a world at peace</ss>
<ss>At the economic summit conference in Cancun, I met with the leaders of 21 nations and sketched out our approach to global economic growth</ss>
<ss>We want to eliminate the barriers to trade and investment which hinder these critical incentives to growth, and we're working to develop new programs to help the poorest nations achieve self-sustaining growth</ss>
<ss>And terms like "peace" and "security," we have to say, have little meaning for the oppressed and the destitute</ss>
<ss>They also mean little to the individual whose state has stripped him of human freedom and dignity</ss>
<ss>Wherever there is oppression, we must strive for the peace and security of individuals as well as states</ss>
<ss>We must recognize that progress and the pursuit of liberty is a necessary complement to military security</ss>
<ss>Nowhere has this fundamental truth been more boldly and clearly stated than in <EVENT> of <DATE></ss>
<ss>These accords have not yet been translated into living reality</ss>
<ss><DATE> I've announced an agenda that can help to achieve peace, security, and freedom across the globe</ss>
<ss>In particular, I have made an important offer to forego entirely deployment of new <NORP> missiles in <LOC> if the <NORP> Union is prepared to respond on an equal footing</ss>
<ss>There is no reason why people in any part of the world should have to live in permanent fear of war or its spectre</ss>
<ss>I believe the time has come for all nations to act in a responsible spirit that doesn't threaten other states</ss>
<ss>I believe the time is right to move forward on arms control and the resolution of critical regional disputes at the conference table</ss>
<ss>Nothing will have a higher priority for me and for the <NORP> people over <DATE></ss>
<ss>Addressing <ORG> <DATE>, another <NORP> <PERSON> described the goal that we still pursue <DATE></ss>
<ss>He said, "If we all can persevere, if we can look beyond our shores and ambitions, then surely the age will dawn in which the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved</ss>
<ss>" He didn't live to see that goal achieved</ss>
<ss>I invite all nations to join with America <DATE> in the quest for such a world</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Good <TIME></ss>
<ss>At <DATE> time, every home takes on a special beauty, a special warmth, and that's certainly true of <ORG>, where so many famous <NORP> have spent their <PERSON> over <DATE></ss>
<ss>This fine old home, the people's house, has seen so much, been so much a part of all our lives and history</ss>
<ss>It's been humbling and inspiring for <PERSON> and me to be spending our <ORDINAL> <DATE> in this place</ss>
<ss>We've lived here as your tenants for <DATE> now, and what a year it's been</ss>
<ss>As a people we've been through quite a lot -- moments of joy, of tragedy, and of real achievement -- moments that I believe have brought us all closer together</ss>
<ss><PERSON> once said that the world would never starve for wonders, but only for the want of wonder</ss>
<ss>At this special time of year, we all renew our sense of wonder in recalling the story of <DATE> in Bethlehem, <DATE></ss>
<ss>Some celebrate <DATE> as the birthday of a great and good philosopher and teacher</ss>
<ss>Others of us believe in the divinity of the child born in Bethlehem, that he was and is the promised Prince of Peace</ss>
<ss>Yes, we've questioned why he who could perform miracles chose to come among us as a helpless babe, but maybe that was his <ORDINAL> miracle, his <ORDINAL> great lesson that we should learn to care for one another</ss>
<ss><TIME>, in millions of <NORP> homes, the glow of the <DATE> tree is a reflection of the love <PERSON> taught us</ss>
<ss>Like the shepherds and wise men of that <ORDINAL> <DATE>, we <NORP> have always tried to follow a higher light, a star, if you will</ss>
<ss>At lonely campfire vigils along the frontier, in <DATE> of <EVENT>, through war and peace, the twin beacons of faith and freedom have brightened the <NORP> sky</ss>
<ss>At times our footsteps may have faltered, but trusting in God's help, we've never lost our way</ss>
<ss>Just across the way from <ORG> stand the two great emblems of <DATE>: a <PERSON>, symbolizing the <NORP> festival of Hanukkah, and <EVENT>, a beautiful towering blue spruce from Pennsylvania</ss>
<ss>Like <EVENT>, our country is a living, growing thing planted in rich <NORP> soil</ss>
<ss>Only our devoted care can bring it to full flower</ss>
<ss>So, let <DATE> be for us a time of rededication</ss>
<ss>Even as we rejoice, however, let us remember that for some <NORP>, this will not be as happy a <DATE> as it should be</ss>
<ss>I know a little of what they feel</ss>
<ss>I remember one <DATE> during <EVENT>, my father opening what he thought was a <DATE> greeting</ss>
<ss>It was a notice that he no longer had a job</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, we've begun the long, hard work of economic recovery</ss>
<ss>Our goal is an America in which every citizen who needs and wants a job can get a job</ss>
<ss>Our program for recovery has only been in place for <DATE> now, but it is beginning to work</ss>
<ss>With your help and prayers, it will succeed</ss>
<ss>We're winning the battle against inflation, runaway government spending and taxation, and that victory will mean more economic growth, more jobs, and more opportunity for all <NORP></ss>
<ss><DATE> before he took up residence in this house, one of my predecessors, <PERSON>, tried to sum up the temper of the times with a quote from an author closely tied to <DATE>, <PERSON></ss>
<ss>We were living, he said, in the best of times and the worst of times</ss>
<ss>Well, in some ways that's even more true <DATE></ss>
<ss>The world is full of peril, as well as promise</ss>
<ss>Too many of its people, even now, live in the shadow of want and tyranny</ss>
<ss>As I speak to you <TIME>, the fate of a proud and ancient nation hangs in the balance</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, <DATE> has been celebrated in Poland, a land of deep religious faith, but <DATE> brings little joy to the courageous <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>They have been betrayed by their own government</ss>
<ss>The men who rule them and their <NORP> allies fear the very freedom that the <NORP> people cherish</ss>
<ss>They have answered the stirrings of liberty with brute force, killings, mass arrests, and the setting up of concentration camps</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and other <ORG> leaders are imprisoned, their fate unknown</ss>
<ss>Factories, mines, universities, and homes have been assaulted</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> government has trampled underfoot solemn commitments to the <ORG> <PRODUCT> and the <PRODUCT> accords</ss>
<ss>It has even broken the Gdansk agreement of <DATE>, by which the <NORP> government recognized the basic right of its people to form free trade unions and to strike</ss>
<ss>The tragic events now occurring in Poland, <DATE> to <DATE> after the <NORP> invasion of Afghanistan, have been precipitated by public and secret pressure from the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>It is no coincidence that <NORP> <PERSON>, chief of the <ORG> forces, and other senior <ORG> officers were in Poland while these outrages were being initiated</ss>
<ss>And it is no coincidence that the martial law proclamations imposed in <DATE> by the <NORP> government were being printed in the <NORP> Union in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The target of this depression  is <ORG>, but in attacking <ORG> its enemies attack an entire people</ss>
<ss>Ten million of Poland's 36 million citizens are members of <ORG></ss>
<ss>Taken together with their families, they account for the overwhelming majority of the <NORP> nation</ss>
<ss>By persecuting <ORG>, the <NORP> government wages war against its own people</ss>
<ss>I urge the <NORP> government and its allies to consider the consequences of their actions</ss>
<ss>How can they possibly justify using naked force to crush a people who ask for nothing more than the right to lead their own lives in freedom and dignity? Brute force may intimidate, but it cannot form the basis of an enduring society, and the ailing <NORP> economy cannot be rebuilt with terror tactics</ss>
<ss>Poland needs cooperation between its government and its people, not military oppression</ss>
<ss>If the <NORP> government will honor the commitments it has made to human rights in documents like the Gdansk agreement, we in America will gladly do our share to help the shattered <NORP> economy, just as we helped the countries of <LOC> after both <EVENT></ss>
<ss>It's ironic that we offered, and Poland expressed interest in accepting, our help after <EVENT></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union intervened then and refused to allow such help to Poland</ss>
<ss>But if the forces of tyranny in Poland, and those who incite them from without, do not relent, they should prepare themselves for serious consequences</ss>
<ss>Already, throughout <ORG>, citizens have publicly demonstrated their support for the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>Our government, and those of our allies, have expressed moral revulsion at the police state tactics of Poland's oppressors</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> has also spoken out, in spite of threats and intimidation</ss>
<ss>But our reaction cannot stop there</ss>
<ss>I want emphatically to state <TIME> that if the outrages in Poland do not cease, we cannot and will not conduct "business as usual" with the perpetrators and those who aid and abet them</ss>
<ss>Make no mistake, their crime will cost them dearly in their future dealings with America and free peoples everywhere</ss>
<ss>I do not make this statement lightly or without serious reflection</ss>
<ss>We have been measured and deliberate in our reaction to the tragic events in Poland</ss>
<ss>We have not acted in haste, and the steps I will outline <TIME> and others we may take in <DATE> are firm, just, and reasonable</ss>
<ss>In order to aid the suffering <NORP> people during this critical period, we will continue the shipment of food through private humanitarian channels, but only so long as we know that the <NORP> people themselves receive the food</ss>
<ss>The neighboring country of Austria has opened her doors to refugees from Poland</ss>
<ss>I have therefore directed that <NORP> assistance, including supplies of basic foodstuffs, be offered to aid the <NORP> in providing for these refugees</ss>
<ss>But to underscore our fundamental opposition to the repressive actions taken by the <NORP> government against its own people, the administration has suspended all government-sponsored shipments of agricultural and dairy products to the <NORP> government</ss>
<ss>This suspension will remain in force until absolute assurances are received that distribution of these products is monitored and guaranteed by independent agencies</ss>
<ss>We must be sure that every bit of food provided by America goes to the <NORP> people, not to their oppressors</ss>
<ss>The United States is taking immediate action to suspend major elements of our economic relationships with the <NORP> government</ss>
<ss>We have halted the renewal of <ORG> line of export credit insurance to the <NORP> government</ss>
<ss>We will suspend <NORP> civil aviation privileges in the United States</ss>
<ss>We are suspending the right of Poland's fishing fleet to operate in <NORP> waters</ss>
<ss>And we're proposing to our allies the further restriction of high technology exports to Poland</ss>
<ss>These actions are not directed against the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>They are a warning to the government of Poland that free men cannot and will not stand idly by in the face of brutal repression</ss>
<ss>To underscore this point, I've written a letter to General <PERSON>, head of the <NORP> government</ss>
<ss>In it, I outlined the steps we're taking and warned of the serious consequences if the <NORP> government continues to use violence against its populace</ss>
<ss>I've urged him to free those in arbitrary detention, to lift martial law, and to restore the internationally recognized rights of the <NORP> people to free speech and association</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union, through its threats and pressures, deserves a major share of blame for the developments in Poland</ss>
<ss>So, I have also sent a letter to President <PERSON> urging him to permit the restoration of basic human rights in Poland provided for in the <LAW></ss>
<ss>In it, I informed him that if this repression continues, the United States will have no choice but to take further concrete political and economic measures affecting our relationship</ss>
<ss>When <DATE> <NORP> patriots rose against foreign oppressors, their rallying cry was, "For our freedom and yours</ss>
<ss>" Well, that motto still rings true in our time</ss>
<ss>There is a spirit of solidarity abroad in the world <TIME> that no physical force can crush</ss>
<ss>It crosses national boundaries and enters into the hearts of men and women everywhere</ss>
<ss>In factories, farms, and schools, in cities and towns around the globe, we the people of <ORG> stand as one with our <NORP> brothers and sisters</ss>
<ss>Their cause is ours, and our prayers and hopes go out to them <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE>, I met in this very room with <PERSON>, the distinguished former <NORP> Ambassador who has sought asylum in our country in protest of the suppression of his native land</ss>
<ss>He told me that one of the ways the <NORP> people have demonstrated their solidarity in the face of martial law is by placing lighted candles in their windows to show that the light of liberty still glows in their hearts</ss>
<ss>Ambassador <PERSON> requested that on <DATE> a lighted candle will burn in <ORG> window as a small but certain beacon of our solidarity with the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>I urge all of you to do the same tomorrow night, on <DATE>, as a personal statement of your commitment to the steps we're taking to support the brave people of Poland in their time of troubles</ss>
<ss>Once, <DATE>, an evil influence threatened that the lights were going out all over the world</ss>
<ss>Let the light of millions of candles in <NORP> homes give notice that the light of freedom is not going to be extinguished</ss>
<ss>We are blessed with a freedom and abundance denied to so many</ss>
<ss>Let those candles remind us that these blessings bring with them a solid obligation, an obligation to the God who guides us, an obligation to the heritage of liberty and dignity handed down to us by our forefathers and an obligation to the children of the world, whose future will be shaped by the way we live our lives <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE> means so much because of one special child</ss>
<ss>But <DATE> also reminds us that all children are special, that they are gifts from God, gifts beyond price that mean more than any presents money can buy</ss>
<ss>In their love and laughter, in our hopes for their future lies the true meaning of <DATE></ss>
<ss>So, in a spirit of gratitude for what we've been able to achieve together over <DATE> and looking forward to all that we hope to achieve together in <DATE>, <PERSON> and I want to wish you all the best of <DATE></ss>
<ss>As <PERSON>, whom I quoted <TIME>, said so well in "<WORK_OF_ART>," "God bless us, every one</ss>
<ss>" Good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: <DATE> marks my <ORDINAL> <ORG> of the <ORG> address to you, a constitutional duty as old as our Republic itself</ss>
<ss><PERSON> Washington began this tradition in <DATE> after reminding the <ORG> that the destiny of self-government and the "preservation of the sacred fire of liberty" is "finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>" For our friends in the press, who place a high premium on accuracy, let me say: I did not actually hear <PERSON> say that</ss>
<ss>But it is a matter of historic record</ss>
<ss>But from this podium, <PERSON> asked the free world to stand together against the onslaught of aggression</ss>
<ss><PERSON> spoke of <DATE> of infamy and summoned a nation to arms</ss>
<ss><PERSON> made an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and served so well</ss>
<ss><PERSON> reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength</ss>
<ss>And <PERSON> spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom</ss>
<ss>When I visited this <ORG> <DATE> as a newcomer to Washington, critical of past policies which I believed had failed, I proposed a new spirit of partnership between this <ORG> and this administration and between Washington and our <ORG> and local governments</ss>
<ss>In forging this new partnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of our Republic -- prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the blessings of individual liberty for our children and, someday, for all of humanity</ss>
<ss>It's my duty to report to you <TIME> on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations, on the foundation we've carefully laid for our economic recovery, and finally, on a bold and spirited initiative that I believe can change the face of <NORP> government and make it again the servant of the people</ss>
<ss>Seldom have the stakes been higher for America</ss>
<ss>What we do and say here will make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit, lumberjacks in the <ORG>, steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment lines; to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago; to hard-pressed farmers and small businessmen; and to millions of everyday <NORP> who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their children</ss>
<ss>To understand the state of the <ORG>, we must look not only at where we are and where we're going but where we've been</ss>
<ss>The situation at this time <DATE> was truly ominous</ss>
<ss><DATE> has seen a series of recessions</ss>
<ss>There was a recession in <DATE>, in <DATE>, and again in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Each time, unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again</ss>
<ss>We coined the word "stagflation" to describe this</ss>
<ss>Government's response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply and increase spending</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, as an example, the money supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar history -- <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Inflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased at an <DATE> rate of <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Interest rates reached a staggering <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>There were 8 million unemployed</ss>
<ss>Late in <DATE> we sank into the present recession, largely because continued high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction</ss>
<ss>And there was a drop in productivity, and the already high unemployment increased</ss>
<ss>This time, however, things are different</ss>
<ss>We have an economic program in place, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past</ss>
<ss>It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, and already that rate has been cut nearly in half</ss>
<ss>But reduced spending the <ORDINAL> and smallest phase of a 3-year tax rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs</ss>
<ss>Already interest rates are down to <PERCENT>, but they must still go lower</ss>
<ss>Inflation is down from <PERCENT> to 8</ss>
<ss>9, and for <DATE> it was running at an <DATE>ized rate of <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>If we had not acted as we did, things would be far worse for all <NORP> than they are <DATE></ss>
<ss>Inflation, taxes, and interest rates would all be higher</ss>
<ss><DATE>, <NORP>' faith in their governmental process was steadily declining</ss>
<ss>Six out of 10 <NORP> were saying they were pessimistic about their future</ss>
<ss>A new kind of defeatism was heard</ss>
<ss>Some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment</ss>
<ss>There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this <ORG></ss>
<ss>It was said we could never work together</ss>
<ss>Well, those predictions were wrong</ss>
<ss>The record is clear, and I believe that history will remember this as an era of <NORP> renewal, remember this administration as an administration of change, and remember this <ORG> as a <ORG> of destiny</ss>
<ss>Together, we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in half, we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweeping changes in our tax structure since <DATE></ss>
<ss>And because we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation, we took away government's built-in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to grow larger at the expense of <NORP> workers</ss>
<ss>- Together, after <DATE> of taking power away from the hands of the people in their <ORG>s and local communities, we have started returning power and resources to them</ss>
<ss>Together, we have cut the growth of new <ORG> regulations nearly in half</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> there were 23,000 fewer pages in <ORG>, which lists new regulations, than there were in <DATE></ss>
<ss>By deregulating oil we've come closer to achieving energy independence and helped bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel</ss>
<ss>Together, we have created an effective <ORG> strike force to combat waste and fraud in government</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> it has saved the taxpayers <MONEY>, and it's only getting started</ss>
<ss>Together we've begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicate wasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands of <NORP> into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America's social problems</ss>
<ss>Together we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace</ss>
<ss>Our country's uniform is being worn once again with pride</ss>
<ss>Together we have made a New Beginning, but we have only begun</ss>
<ss>No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy</ss>
<ss>In my Inaugural Address <DATE>, I warned that the "ills we suffer have come upon us over <DATE></ss>
<ss>They will not go away in <DATE>, <DATE>, or <DATE>, but they will go away</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>because we as <NORP> have the capacity now, as we've had it in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom</ss>
<ss>" ' The economy will face difficult moments in <DATE></ss>
<ss>But the program for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by <DATE></ss>
<ss>And that is why I can report to you <TIME> that in the near future the state of the <ORG> and the economy will be better -- much better -- if we summon the strength to continue on the course that we've charted</ss>
<ss>And so, the question: If the fundamentals are in place, what now? Well, two things</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the economy</ss>
<ss>Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program that's only just now getting underway, as some would have you believe; they are the inheritance of <DATE> of tax and tax and spend and spend</ss>
<ss>Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery</ss>
<ss>That plan is based on four commonsense fundamentals: continued reduction of the growth in <ORG> spending; preserving the individual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving and investment; removing unnecessary <ORG> regulations to spark productivity; and maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy, the latter a responsibility of <ORG></ss>
<ss>The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to the policies that gave us a <MONEY> debt, runaway inflation, runaway interest rates and unemployment</ss>
<ss>The doubters would have us turn back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate reductions already passed by this <ORG></ss>
<ss>Raise present taxes to cut future deficits, they tell us</ss>
<ss>Well, I don't believe we should buy that argument</ss>
<ss>There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surpluses <DATE> ahead with any degree of accuracy</ss>
<ss>The budget in place, when I took office, had been projected as balanced</ss>
<ss>It turned out to have one of the biggest deficits in history</ss>
<ss>Another example of the imponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable -- a change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by <MONEY></ss>
<ss>As it now stands, our forecast, which we're required by law to make, will show major deficits starting at <MONEY> and declining, but still too high</ss>
<ss>More important, we're making progress with the three keys to reducing deficits: economic growth, lower interest rates, and spending control</ss>
<ss>The policies we have in place will reduce the deficit steadily, surely, and in time, completely</ss>
<ss>Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits</ss>
<ss>If they did, how would we explain that tax revenues more than doubled just since <DATE>; yet in that same 6-year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> tax revenues increased by <MONEY>, and in <DATE> we had one of our all-time biggest deficits</ss>
<ss>Raising taxes won't balance the budget; it will encourage more government spending and less private investment</ss>
<ss>Raising taxes will slow economic growth, reduce production, and destroy future jobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and more likely that those who now have jobs could lose them</ss>
<ss>So, I will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the backs of the <NORP> taxpayers</ss>
<ss>I will seek no tax increases <DATE>, and I have no intention of retreating from our basic program of tax relief</ss>
<ss>I promise to bring the <NORP> people -- to bring their tax rates down and to keep them down, to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in America's future</ss>
<ss>I will stand by my word</ss>
<ss><TIME> I'm urging the <NORP> people: Seize these new opportunities to produce, to save, to invest, and together we'll make this economy a mighty engine of freedom, hope, and prosperity again</ss>
<ss>Now, the budget deficit <DATE> will exceed our earlier expectations</ss>
<ss>The recession did that</ss>
<ss>It lowered revenues and increased costs</ss>
<ss>To some extent, we're also victims of our own success</ss>
<ss>We've brought inflation down faster than we thought we could, and in doing this, we've deprived government of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes people into higher income tax brackets</ss>
<ss>And the continued high interest rates <DATE> cost the government <MONEY> more than anticipated</ss>
<ss>We must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more waste, and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employees in the <ORG> work force by 75,000</ss>
<ss>The budget plan I submit to you on <DATE> will realize major savings by dismantling <ORG> and by eliminating ineffective subsidies for business</ss>
<ss>We'll continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities -- a strong national defense to keep America free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social programs for those who have contributed and those who are in need</ss>
<ss>Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this administration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly or America's poor</ss>
<ss>Under the new budget, funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent <DATE></ss>
<ss>But it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical</ss>
<ss>The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients</ss>
<ss>We will protect them</ss>
<ss>But there's only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help</ss>
<ss>And that is to bring their spiraling costs under control</ss>
<ss><DATE> we face the absurd situation of a <ORG> budget with three-quarters of its expenditures routinely referred to as "uncontrollable</ss>
<ss>" And a large part of this goes to entitlement programs</ss>
<ss>Committee after committee of this <ORG> has heard witness after witness describe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife with waste and fraud</ss>
<ss>Virtually every <NORP> who shops in a local supermarket is aware of the <DATE> abuses that take place in the food stamp program, which has grown by <PERCENT> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Another example is <ORG> and <ORG> -- programs with worthy goals but whose costs have increased from 11</ss>
<ss>2 billion to almost 60 billion, more than 5 times as much, in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Waste and fraud are serious problems</ss>
<ss>Back in <DATE> <ORG> investigators testified before one of your committees that "corruption has permeated virtually every area of the <ORG> and <ORG> health care industry</ss>
<ss>" One official said many of the people who are cheating the system were "very confident that nothing was going to happen to them</ss>
<ss>" Well, something is going to happen</ss>
<ss>Not only the taxpayers are defrauded; the people with real dependency on these programs are deprived of what they need, because available resources are going not to the needy, but to the greedy</ss>
<ss>The time has come to control the uncontrollable</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> we made a start</ss>
<ss>I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by <MONEY> over <DATE> while at the same time preserving essential services for the truly needy</ss>
<ss>Shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to install -- some new, but others long recommended by your own congressional committees</ss>
<ss>I ask you to help make these savings for the <NORP> taxpayer</ss>
<ss>The savings we propose in entitlement programs will total <MONEY> over <DATE> and will, without affecting social t security, go a long way toward bringing <ORG> spending under control</ss>
<ss>But don't be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive the elderly, the needy, and the helpless</ss>
<ss>The</ss>
<ss><ORG> will still subsidize 95 million meals every day</ss>
<ss>That's one out of seven of all the meals served in America</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, senior nutrition programs, and child welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed <DATE></ss>
<ss>More than one-half billion dollars has been proposed for minority business assistance</ss>
<ss>And research at <ORG> will be increased by <MONEY></ss>
<ss>While meeting all these needs, we intend to plug unwarranted tax loopholes and strengthen the law which requires all large corporations to pay a minimum tax</ss>
<ss>I am confident the economic program we've put into operation will protect the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all <NORP></ss>
<ss>It will stimulate the economy, result in increased savings and provide capital for expansion, mortgages for homebuilding, and jobs for the unemployed</ss>
<ss>Now that the essentials of that program are in place, our next major undertaking must be a program -- just as bold, just as innovative -- to make government again accountable to the people, to make our system of federalism work again</ss>
<ss>Our citizens feel they've lost control of even the most basic decisions made about the essential services of government, such as schools, welfare, roads, and even garbage collection</ss>
<ss>And they're right</ss>
<ss>A maze of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems</ss>
<ss>They don't know where to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise, who to blame, who to vote for or against</ss>
<ss>The main reason for this is the overpowering growth of <ORG> grants-in-aid programs during <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> <ORG> had 132 categorical grant programs, costing <MONEY></ss>
<ss>When I took office, there were approximately 500, costing <MONEY> -- 13 programs for energy, 36 for pollution control, 66 for social services, 90 for education</ss>
<ss>And here in the <ORG>, it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them</ss>
<ss>You know and I know that neither the <PERSON> nor the <ORG> can properly oversee this jungle of grants-in-aid; indeed, the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government</ss>
<ss>As one <NORP> Governor put it recently: <ORG> should be worrying about "arms control, not potholes</ss>
<ss>" The growth in these <ORG> programs has -- in the words of one intergovernmental commission -- made <ORG> "more pervasive, more intrusive, more unmanageable, more ineffective and costly, and above all, more  accountable</ss>
<ss>" Let's solve this problem with a single, bold stroke: the return of <MONEY> in <ORG> programs to <ORG> and local government, together with the means to finance them and a transition period of <DATE> to avoid unnecessary disruption</ss>
<ss>I will shortly send this <ORG> a message describing this program</ss>
<ss>I want to emphasize, however, that its full details will have been worked out only after close consultation with congressional, <ORG>, and local officials</ss>
<ss>Starting in <DATE>, <ORG> will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing <ORG> program to go along with its existing responsibility for <ORG></ss>
<ss>As part of a financially equal swap, the <ORG>s will simultaneously take full responsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps</ss>
<ss>This will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need, because it'll be designed and administered closer to the grass roots and the people it serves</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> <ORG> will apply the full proceeds from certain excise taxes to a grass roots trust fund that will belong in fair shares to the 50 <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>The total amount flowing into this fund will be <MONEY> a year</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE> the <ORG>s can use this money in either of two ways</ss>
<ss>If they want to continue receiving <ORG> grants in such areas as transportation, education, and social services, they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grants</ss>
<ss>Or to the extent they choose to forgo the <ORG> grant programs, they can use their trust fund money on their own for those or other purposes</ss>
<ss>There will be a mandatory pass-through of part of these funds to local governments</ss>
<ss>By <DATE> the <ORG>s will be in complete control of over 40 <ORG> grant programs</ss>
<ss>The trust fund will start to phase out, eventually to disappear, and the excise taxes will be turned over to the <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>They can then preserve, lower, or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit</ss>
<ss>In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the <ORG> level while we ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they're meant to help and the people who pay for them</ss>
<ss>Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of <ORG> and local governments, we're proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the <DATE>'s and <DATE></ss>
<ss>This legislation will permit <ORG>s and localities to apply to <ORG> for designation as urban enterprise zones</ss>
<ss>A broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attract new business, new jobs, new opportunity to America's inner cities and rural towns</ss>
<ss>Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise</ss>
<ss>Well, I say we must free enterprise so that together we can save America</ss>
<ss>Some will also say our <ORG>s and local communities are not up to the challenge of a new and creative partnership</ss>
<ss>Well, that might have been true <DATE> before reforms like reapportionment and <LAW>, the 10-year extension of which I strongly support</ss>
<ss>It's no longer true <DATE></ss>
<ss>This administration has faith in <ORG> and local governments and the constitutional balance envisioned by <ORG></ss>
<ss>We also believe in the integrity, decency, and sound, good sense of grass roots <NORP></ss>
<ss>Our faith in the <NORP> people is reflected in another major endeavor</ss>
<ss>Our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful community models of school, church, business, union, foundation, and civic programs that help community needs</ss>
<ss>Such groups are almost invariably far more efficient than government in running social programs</ss>
<ss>We're not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar, service for service</ss>
<ss>We just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example</ss>
<ss>Three hundred and eighty-five thousand corporations and private organizations are already working on social programs ranging from drug rehabilitation to job training, and thousands more <NORP> have written us asking how they can help</ss>
<ss>The volunteer spirit is still alive and well in America</ss>
<ss>Our nation's long journey towards civil rights for all our citizens -- once a source of discord, now a source of pride -- must continue with no backsliding or slowing down</ss>
<ss>We must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and, when necessary, strengthened</ss>
<ss>Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable</ss>
<ss>We launched a new <PRODUCT> on Legal Equity for Women and a Fifty <ORG>s Project that will examine <ORG> laws for discriminatory language</ss>
<ss>And for the <ORDINAL> time in our history, a woman sits on the highest court in the land</ss>
<ss>So, too, the problem of crime -- one as real and deadly serious as any in America <DATE></ss>
<ss>It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system, which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society and the innocent victims of crime without justice</ss>
<ss>We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air</ss>
<ss>We're encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the <ORG> and are hopeful of further progress as the <ORG> continues its deliberations</ss>
<ss>So far, I've concentrated largely, now, on domestic matters</ss>
<ss>To view the state of the <ORG> in perspective, we must not ignore the rest of the world</ss>
<ss>There isn't time <TIME> for a lengthy treatment of social -- or foreign policy, I should say, a subject I intend to address in detail in the near future</ss>
<ss>A few words, however, are in order on the progress we've made over <DATE>, reestablishing respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in <DATE></ss>
<ss>At Ottawa and <PERSON>, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations</ss>
<ss>Now, some of those I met with were a little surprised that I didn't apologize for America's wealth</ss>
<ss>Instead, I spoke of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them realize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom</ss>
<ss>I believe lasting friendships were made, and the foundation was laid for future cooperation</ss>
<ss>In the vital region of <LOC>, we're developing a program of aid, trade, and investment incentives to promote self-sustaining growth and a better, more secure life for our neighbors to the south</ss>
<ss>Toward those who would export terrorism and subversion in the <LOC> and elsewhere, especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness</ss>
<ss>Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness, and balance</ss>
<ss>By restoring America's military credibility, by pursuing peace at the negotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good faith, and by regaining the respect of America's allies and adversaries alike, we have strengthened our country's position as a force for peace and progress in the world</ss>
<ss>When action is called for, we're taking it</ss>
<ss>Our sanctions against the military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in Poland -- and against the <NORP> regime behind that military dictatorship-clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not conduct "business as usual" with the forces of oppression</ss>
<ss>If the events in Poland continue to deteriorate, further measures will follow</ss>
<ss>Now, let me also note that private <NORP> groups have taken the lead in making <DATE> <DATE> of solidarity with the people of Poland</ss>
<ss>So, too, <ORG> has called for <DATE> to be <DATE> of support for Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>Well, I urge all peace-loving peoples to join together on <DATE>, to raise their voices, to speak and pray for freedom</ss>
<ss>Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as I announced in my address to the <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>We have proposed to the <NORP> <ORG> a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces</ss>
<ss>In those talks it is essential that we negotiate from a position of strength</ss>
<ss>There must be a real incentive for the <NORP> to take these talks seriously</ss>
<ss>This requires that we rebuild our defenses</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, while we sought the moderation of <NORP> power through a process of restraint and accommodation, the <NORP> engaged in an unrelenting buildup of their military forces</ss>
<ss>The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces</ss>
<ss>We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in <LOC> and <LOC>, or to develop key relationships with our partners in <LOC> and other countries</ss>
<ss>Building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up</ss>
<ss>When radical forces threaten our friends, when economic misfortune creates conditions of instability, when strategically vital parts of the world fall under the shadow of <NORP> power, our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence</ss>
<ss>That's why we've laid such stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program</ss>
<ss>Your recent passage of <LAW> sent a signal to the world that America will not shrink from making the investments necessary for both peace and security</ss>
<ss>Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism, not naivete or self-delusion</ss>
<ss>A recognition of what the <NORP> empire is about is the starting point</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, in negotiating with the <NORP>, observed that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations</ss>
<ss>That's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses</ss>
<ss>We intend to keep the peace</ss>
<ss>We will also keep our freedom</ss>
<ss>We have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements and worldwide broadcasts</ss>
<ss>In the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation, we've promised the world a season of truth -- the truth of our great civilized ideas: individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law under God</ss>
<ss>We've never needed walls or minefields or barbed wire to keep our people in</ss>
<ss>Nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from voting for the kind of government they want</ss>
<ss>Yes, we have our problems; yes, we're in a time of recession</ss>
<ss>And it's true, there's no quick fix, as I said, to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment</ss>
<ss>But we will end it</ss>
<ss>The process has already begun, and we'll see its effect as <DATE> goes on</ss>
<ss>We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of <NORP> who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course <DATE></ss>
<ss>But our glory didn't end with them</ss>
<ss><NORP> ever since have emulated their deeds</ss>
<ss>We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes</ss>
<ss>They're all around us</ss>
<ss>One who sits among you here <TIME> epitomized that heroism at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our <ORG></ss>
<ss>Who will ever forget <TIME> when we waited for television to bring us the scene of that <ORDINAL> plane landing at <FAC> in the Philippines, bringing our POW's home? The plane door opened and <PERSON> came slowly down the ramp</ss>
<ss>He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said, "<WORK_OF_ART>," and then thanked us for bringing him home</ss>
<ss><DATE>, in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the <LOC>, we saw again the spirit of <NORP> heroism at its finest -- the heroism of dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters</ss>
<ss>And we saw the heroism of one of our young government employees, <PERSON>, who, when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line, dived into the water and dragged her to safety</ss>
<ss>And then there are countless, quiet, everyday heroes of <NORP> who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than they've known; church and civic volunteers who help to feed, clothe, nurse, and teach the needy; millions who've made our nation and our nation's destiny so very special-unsung heroes who may not have realized their own dreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams in their children</ss>
<ss>Don't let anyone tell you that America's <DATE> are behind her, that the <NORP> spirit has been vanquished</ss>
<ss>We've seen it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing in it now</ss>
<ss>A hundred and twenty years ago, the greatest of all our <PERSON>s delivered his <ORDINAL> <ORG> of the <ORG> message in this <ORG></ss>
<ss>"We cannot escape history," <PERSON> warned</ss>
<ss>"We of this <ORG> and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves</ss>
<ss>" The "trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest  generation</ss>
<ss>" Well, that <PERSON> and that <ORG> did not fail the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>Together they weathered the storm and preserved the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Let it be said of us that we, too, did not fail; that we, too, worked together to bring America through difficult times</ss>
<ss>Let us so conduct ourselves that <DATE>, another <ORG> and another <PERSON>, meeting in this <ORG> as we are meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying that we met the test and preserved for them in <DATE> the sacred flame of liberty -- this last, best hope of man on <LOC></ss>
<ss>God bless you, and thank you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My Lord Chancellor, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>: The journey of which this visit forms a part is a long one</ss>
<ss>Already it has taken me to two great cities of the <LOC>, Rome and Paris, and to the economic summit at Versailles</ss>
<ss>And there, once again, our sister democracies have proved that even in a time of severe economic strain, free peoples can work together freely and voluntarily to address problems as serious as inflation, unemployment, trade, and economic development in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity</ss>
<ss>Other milestones lie ahead</ss>
<ss><DATE>, in Germany, we and our <ORG> allies will discuss measures for our joint defense and America's latest initiatives for a more peaceful, secure world through arms reductions</ss>
<ss>Each stop of this trip is important, but among them all, this moment occupies a special place in my heart and in the hearts of my countrymen -- a moment of kinship and homecoming in these hallowed halls</ss>
<ss>Speaking for all <NORP>, I want to say how very much at home we feel in your house</ss>
<ss>Every <NORP> would, because this is, as we have been so eloquently told, one of democracy's shrines</ss>
<ss>Here the rights of free people and the processes of representation have been debated and refined</ss>
<ss>It has been said that an institution is the lengthening shadow of a man</ss>
<ss>This institution is the lengthening shadow of all the men and women who have sat here and all those who have voted to send representatives here</ss>
<ss>This is my <ORDINAL> visit to Great Britain as President of the United States</ss>
<ss>My <ORDINAL> opportunity to stand on <NORP> soil occurred <DATE> when your Prime Minister graciously hosted a diplomatic dinner at <ORG> in Washington</ss>
<ss>Mrs</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said then that she hoped I was not distressed to find staring down at me from the grand staircase a portrait of His Royal Majesty King <PERSON></ss>
<ss>She suggested it was best to let bygones be bygones, and in view of our two countries' remarkable friendship in <DATE>, she added that most <PERSON> <DATE> would agree with <PERSON> that "a little rebellion now and then is a very good thing</ss>
<ss>"  Well, from here I will go to Bonn and then Berlin, where there stands a grim symbol of power untamed</ss>
<ss><FAC>, that dreadful gray gash across the city, is in <DATE></ss>
<ss>It is the fitting signature of the regime that built it</ss>
<ss>And <QUANTITY> behind <FAC>, there is another symbol</ss>
<ss>In the center of Warsaw, there is a sign that notes the distances to two capitals</ss>
<ss>In one direction it points toward Moscow</ss>
<ss>In the other it points toward Brussels, headquarters of <LOC> tangible unity</ss>
<ss>The marker says that the distances from Warsaw to Moscow and Warsaw to Brussels are equal</ss>
<ss>The sign makes this point: Poland is not <LOC> or <LOC></ss>
<ss>Poland is at the center of <NORP> civilization</ss>
<ss>It has contributed mightily to that civilization</ss>
<ss>It is doing so <DATE> by being magnificently unreconciled to oppression</ss>
<ss>Poland's struggle to be Poland and to secure the basic rights we often take for granted demonstrates why we dare not take those rights for granted</ss>
<ss><ORG>, defending <LAW> of <DATE>, declared, "You cannot fight against the future</ss>
<ss><ORG> is on our side</ss>
<ss>" It was easier to believe in the march of democracy in <ORG>'s day -- in <TIME> of <NORP> optimism</ss>
<ss>We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible political invention -- <NORP>ism</ss>
<ss>Optimism comes less easily <DATE>, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's enemies have refined their instruments of repression</ss>
<ss>Yet optimism is in order, because day by day democracy is proving itself to be a not-at-all-fragile flower</ss>
<ss>From <PERSON> on the <NORP> to Varna on <LOC>, the regimes planted by <NORP>ism have had <DATE> to establish their legitimacy</ss>
<ss>But none -- not one regime -- has yet been able to risk free elections</ss>
<ss>Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root</ss>
<ss>The strength of the <ORG> movement in Poland demonstrates the truth told in an underground joke in the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>It is that the <NORP> Union would remain a one-party nation even if an opposition party were permitted, because everyone would join the opposition party</ss>
<ss>America's time as a player on the stage of world history has been brief</ss>
<ss>I think understanding this fact has always made you patient with your younger cousins -- well, not always patient</ss>
<ss>I do recall that on one occasion, Sir <PERSON> said in exasperation about one of our most distinguished diplomats: "He is the only case I know of a bull who carries his china shop with him</ss>
<ss>"  But witty as Sir <PERSON> was, he also had that special attribute of great statesmen -- the gift of vision, the willingness to see the future based on the experience of the past</ss>
<ss>It is this sense of history, this understanding of the past that I want to talk with you about <DATE>, for it is in remembering what we share of the past that our two nations can make common cause for the future</ss>
<ss>We have not inherited an easy world</ss>
<ss>If developments like <EVENT>, which began here in England, and the gifts of science and technology have made life much easier for us, they have also made it more dangerous</ss>
<ss>There are threats now to our freedom, indeed to our very existence, that other generations could never even have imagined</ss>
<ss>There is <ORDINAL> the threat of global war</ss>
<ss>No President, no <ORG>, no Prime Minister, no <ORG> can spend <DATE> entirely free of this threat</ss>
<ss>And I don't have to tell you that in <DATE>'s world the existence of nuclear weapons could mean, if not the extinction of mankind, then surely the end of civilization as we know it</ss>
<ss>That's why negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces now underway in <LOC> and the <ORG> talks -- Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -- which will begin <DATE>, are not just critical to <NORP> or <NORP> policy; they are critical to mankind</ss>
<ss>Our commitment to early success in these negotiations is firm and unshakable, and our purpose is clear: reducing the risk of war by reducing the means of waging war on both sides</ss>
<ss>At the same time there is a threat posed to human freedom by the enormous power of the modern state</ss>
<ss>History teaches the dangers of government that overreaches -- political control taking precedence over free economic growth, secret police, mindless bureaucracy, all combining to stifle individual excellence and personal freedom</ss>
<ss>Now, I'm aware that among us here and throughout <LOC> there is legitimate disagreement over the extent to which the public sector should play a role in a nation's economy and life</ss>
<ss>But on one point all of us are united -- our abhorrence of dictatorship in all its forms, but most particularly <NORP>ism and the terrible inhumanities it has caused in our time -- the great purge, <ORG> and <PERSON>, the <PERSON>, and Cambodia</ss>
<ss>Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint and peaceful intentions of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>They will note that it was the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear monopoly in the forties and early fifties for territorial or imperial gain</ss>
<ss>Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the <NORP> world, the map of <LOC> -- indeed, the world would look very different <DATE></ss>
<ss>And certainly they will note it was not the democracies that invaded Afghanistan or supressed <NORP> <ORG> or used chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and <LOC></ss>
<ss>If history teaches anything it teaches self-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly</ss>
<ss>We see around us <DATE> the marks of our terrible dilemma -- predictions of <DATE>, antinuclear demonstrations, an arms race in which the <LOC> must, for its own protection, be an unwilling participant</ss>
<ss>At the same time we see <NORP> forces in the world who seek subversion and conflict around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human spirit</ss>
<ss>What, then, is our course? Must civilization perish in a hail of fiery atoms? Must freedom wither in a quiet, deadening accommodation with <NORP> evil? Sir <PERSON> refused to accept the inevitability of war or even that it was imminent</ss>
<ss>He said, "I do not believe that <NORP> Russia desires war</ss>
<ss>What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines</ss>
<ss>But what we have to consider here <DATE> while time remains is the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries</ss>
<ss>" Well, this is precisely our mission <DATE>: to preserve freedom as well as peace</ss>
<ss>It may not be easy to see; but I believe we live now at a turning point</ss>
<ss>In an ironic sense <PERSON> was right</ss>
<ss>We are witnessing <DATE> a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political order</ss>
<ss>But the crisis is happening not in the free, <NORP> <LOC>, but in the home of <NORP>-Leninism, the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>It is the <NORP> Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens</ss>
<ss>It also is in deep economic difficulty</ss>
<ss>The rate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then</ss>
<ss>The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people</ss>
<ss>Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in <NORP> agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine</ss>
<ss>These private plots occupy a bare <PERCENT> of the arable land but account for nearly one-quarter of <NORP> farm output and nearly one-third of meat products and vegetables</ss>
<ss>Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, <DATE> after <DATE> the <NORP> system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction</ss>
<ss>The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones</ss>
<ss>The decay of the <NORP> experiment should come as no surprise to us</ss>
<ss>Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and closed societies -- <LOC> Germany and <LOC> Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam -- it is the <NORP> countries what are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people</ss>
<ss>And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this: Of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world, their flight is always away from, not toward the <NORP> world</ss>
<ss><DATE> on the <ORG> line, our military forces face east to prevent a possible invasion</ss>
<ss>On the other side of the line, the <NORP> forces also face east to prevent their people from leaving</ss>
<ss>The hard evidence of <NORP> rule has caused in mankind an uprising of the intellect and will</ss>
<ss>Whether it is the growth of the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying thread running through the intellectual work of these groups -- rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses</ss>
<ss>Since the exodus from Egypt, historians have written of those who sacrificed and struggled for freedom -- the stand at Thermopylae, the revolt of Spartacus, the storming of the Bastille, the Warsaw uprising in <EVENT></ss>
<ss>More recently we've seen evidence of this same human impulse in one of the developing nations in <LOC></ss>
<ss>For <DATE> and <DATE> the world news media covered the fighting in El Salvador</ss>
<ss><DATE> after day we were treated to stories and film slanted toward the brave freedom-fighters battling oppressive government forces in behalf of the silent, suffering people of that tortured country</ss>
<ss>And then <DATE> those silent, suffering people were offered a chance to vote, to choose the kind of government they wanted</ss>
<ss>Suddenly the freedom-fighters in the hills were exposed for what they really are -- <NORP>-backed guerrillas who want power for themselves, and their backers, not democracy for the people</ss>
<ss>They threatened death to any who voted, and destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from getting to the polling places</ss>
<ss>But on <DATE>, the people of El Salvador, an unprecedented 1</ss>
<ss>4 million of them, braved ambush and gunfire, and trudged for miles to vote for freedom</ss>
<ss>They stood for <TIME> in the hot sun waiting for their turn to vote</ss>
<ss>Members of our <ORG> who went there as observers told me of a women who was wounded by rifle fire on the way to the polls, who refused to leave the line to have her wound treated until after she had voted</ss>
<ss>A grandmother, who had been told by the guerrillas she would be killed when she returned from the polls, and she told the guerrillas, "You can kill me, you can kill my family, kill my neighbors, but you can't kill us all</ss>
<ss>" The real freedom-fighters of El Salvador turned out to be the people of that country -- the young, the old, the in-between</ss>
<ss>Strange, but in my own country there's been little if any news coverage of that war since the election</ss>
<ss>Now, perhaps they'll say it's -- well, because there are newer struggles now</ss>
<ss>On distant islands in <LOC> young men are fighting for Britain</ss>
<ss>And, yes, voices have been raised protesting their sacrifice for lumps of rock and earth so far away</ss>
<ss>But those young men aren't fighting for mere real estate</ss>
<ss>They fight for a cause -- for the belief that armed aggression must not be allowed to succeed, and the people must participate in the decisions of government --  -- the decisions of government under the rule of law</ss>
<ss>If there had been firmer support for that principle <DATE>, perhaps our generation wouldn't have suffered the bloodletting of <EVENT></ss>
<ss>In <LOC> now the guns sound once more, this time in Lebanon, a country that for too long has had to endure the tragedy of civil war, terrorism, and foreign intervention and occupation</ss>
<ss>The fighting in Lebanon on the part of all parties must stop, and Israel should bring its forces home</ss>
<ss>But this is not enough</ss>
<ss>We must all work to stamp out the scourge of terrorism that in <LOC> makes war an ever-present threat</ss>
<ss>But beyond the troublespots lies a deeper, more positive pattern</ss>
<ss>Around the world <DATE>, <EVENT> is gathering new strength</ss>
<ss>In India a critical test has been passed with the peaceful change of governing political parties</ss>
<ss>In <LOC>, Nigeria is moving into remarkable and unmistakable ways to build and strengthen its <NORP> institutions</ss>
<ss>In the <LOC> and <LOC>, 16 of 24 countries have freely elected governments</ss>
<ss>And in <ORG>, 8 of the 10 developing nations which have joined that body in <DATE> are democracies</ss>
<ss>In the <NORP> world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again</ss>
<ss>To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule -- <DATE> in <LOC> Germany, <DATE> in Hungary, <DATE> in Czechoslovakia, <DATE> in Poland</ss>
<ss>But the struggle continues in Poland</ss>
<ss>And we know that there are even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the <NORP> Union itself</ss>
<ss>How we conduct ourselves here in the <NORP> democracies will determine whether this trend continues</ss>
<ss>No, democracy is not a fragile flower</ss>
<ss>Still it needs cultivating</ss>
<ss>If the rest of <DATE> is to witness the gradual growth of freedom and <NORP> ideals, we must take actions to assist the campaign for democracy</ss>
<ss>Some argue that we should encourage <NORP> change in right-wing dictatorships, but not in <NORP> regimes</ss>
<ss>Well, to accept this preposterous notion -- as some well-meaning people have -- is to invite the argument that once countries achieve a nuclear capability, they should be allowed an undisturbed reign of terror over their own citizens</ss>
<ss>We reject this course</ss>
<ss>As for the <NORP> view, Chairman <PERSON> repeatedly has stressed that the competition of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent with relaxation of tensions and peace</ss>
<ss>Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with the international obligations they have undertaken</ss>
<ss>We ask only for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an instant transformation</ss>
<ss>We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement there has been and will continue to be repeated explosions against repression and dictatorships</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union itself is not immune to this reality</ss>
<ss>Any system is inherently unstable that has no peaceful means to legitimize its leaders</ss>
<ss>In such cases, the very repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist it, if necessary, by force</ss>
<ss>While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take concrete actions to move toward them</ss>
<ss>We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings</ss>
<ss>So states <ORG> Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which, among other things, guarantees free elections</ss>
<ss>The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster the infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their own differences through peaceful means</ss>
<ss>This is not cultural imperialism, it is providing the means for genuine self-determination and protection for diversity</ss>
<ss>Democracy already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and historical experiences</ss>
<ss>It would be cultural condescension, or worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy</ss>
<ss>Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote, decide to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent newspapers, prefer government to worker-controlled unions, opt for land to be owned by the state instead of those who till it, want government repression of religious liberty, a single political party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead of <NORP> tolerance and diversity? Since <DATE> the <NORP> Union has given covert political training and assistance to <NORP>-Leninists in many countries</ss>
<ss>Of course, it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these same forces</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, <NORP> and other <NORP>, <NORP>, and leaders have offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and social institutions to bring about peaceful and <NORP> progress</ss>
<ss>Appropriately, for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany's political foundations have become a major force in this effort</ss>
<ss>We in America now intend to take additional steps, as many of our allies have already done, toward realizing this same goal</ss>
<ss>The chairmen and other leaders of the national <NORP> and <ORG> organizations are initiating a study with the bipartisan <NORP> political foundation to determine how the United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy now gathering force</ss>
<ss>They will have the cooperation of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives of business, labor, and other major institutions in our society</ss>
<ss>I look forward to receiving their recommendations and to working with these institutions and the <ORG> in the common task of strengthening democracy throughout the world</ss>
<ss>It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation -- in both the public and private sectors -- to assisting <NORP> development</ss>
<ss>We plan to consult with leaders of other nations as well</ss>
<ss>There is a proposal before <ORG> to invite parliamentarians from <NORP> countries to a meeting <DATE> in Strasbourg</ss>
<ss>That prestigious gathering could consider ways to help <NORP> political movements</ss>
<ss><DATE> in Washington there will take place an international meeting on free elections</ss>
<ss>And <DATE> there will be a conference of world authorities on constitutionalism and self-goverment hosted by the Chief Justice of the United States</ss>
<ss>Authorities from a number of developing and developed countries -- judges, philosophers, and politicians with practical experience -- have agreed to explore how to turn principle into practice and further the rule of law</ss>
<ss>At the same time, we invite the <NORP> Union to consider with us how the competition of ideas and values -- which it is committed to support -- can be conducted on a peaceful and reciprocal basis</ss>
<ss>For example, I am prepared to offer President <PERSON> an opportunity to speak to the <NORP> people on our television if he will allow me the same opportunity with the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>We also suggest that panels of our newsmen periodically appear on each other's television to discuss major events</ss>
<ss>Now, I don't wish to sound overly optimistic, yet the <NORP> Union is not immune from the reality of what is going on in the world</ss>
<ss>It has happened in the past -- a small ruling elite either mistakenly attempts to ease domestic unrest through greater repression and foreign adventure, or it chooses a wiser course</ss>
<ss>It begins to allow its people a voice in their own destiny</ss>
<ss>Even if this latter process is not realized soon, I believe the renewed strength of the <NORP> movement, complemented by a global campaign for freedom, will strengthen the prospects for arms control and a world at peace</ss>
<ss>I have discussed on other occasions, including my address on <DATE>, the elements of <NORP> policies toward the <NORP> Union to safeguard our interests and protect the peace</ss>
<ss>What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term -- the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people</ss>
<ss>And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen <ORG> even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads</ss>
<ss>Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used, for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that's now going on in the world will not be bombs and rockets, but a test of wills and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the beliefs we cherish, the ideals to which we are dedicated</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people know that, given strong leadership, time and a little bit of hope, the forces of good ultimately rally and triumph over evil</ss>
<ss>Here among you is the cradle of self-government, <ORG></ss>
<ss>Here is the enduring greatness of the <NORP> contribution to mankind, the great civilized ideas: individual liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under God</ss>
<ss>I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the <LOC> about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world</ss>
<ss>This reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the Blitz</ss>
<ss>As the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing</ss>
<ss>And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled the cork to give her a taste of it</ss>
<ss>She came around immediately and said, "Here now -- there now, put it back</ss>
<ss>That's for emergencies</ss>
<ss>"  Well, the emergency is upon us</ss>
<ss>Let us be shy no longer</ss>
<ss>Let us go to our strength</ss>
<ss>Let us offer hope</ss>
<ss>Let us tell the world that a new age is not only possible but probable</ss>
<ss>During the dark days of <EVENT>, when this island was incandescent with courage, <PERSON> exclaimed about Britain's adversaries, "What kind of a people do they think we are?" Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary people the <NORP> are</ss>
<ss>But all the democracies paid a terrible price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us</ss>
<ss>We dare not make that mistake again</ss>
<ss>So, let us ask ourselves, "What kind of people do we think we are?" And let us answer, "Free people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so but to help others gain their freedom as well</ss>
<ss>" Sir <PERSON> led his people to great victory in war and then lost an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed</ss>
<ss>But he left office honorably, and, as it turned out, temporarily, knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than the fate of any single leader</ss>
<ss>History recalls his greatness in ways no dictator will ever know</ss>
<ss>And he left us a message of hope for the future, as timely now as when he <ORDINAL> uttered it, as opposition leader in the <PERSON> <DATE>, when he said, "When we look back on all the perils through which we have passed and at the mighty foes that we have laid low and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated, why should we fear for our future? We have," he said, "come safely through the worst</ss>
<ss>" Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation</ss>
<ss>But together, we too have come through the worst</ss>
<ss>Let us now begin a major effort to secure the best -- a crusade for freedom that will engage the faith and fortitude of <DATE></ss>
<ss>For the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which all people are at last free to determine their own destiny</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss>President, Chancellor <PERSON>, members of the Bundestag, distinguished guests: Perhaps because I've just come from London, I have this urge to quote the great Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> who said, "The feeling of friendship is like that of being comfortably filled with roast beef</ss>
<ss>"  Well, I feel very much filled with friendship <TIME>, and I bring you the warmest regards and goodwill of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>I'm very honored to speak to you <DATE> and, thus, to all the people of <NORP>y</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we will jointly celebrate the <ORG> anniversary of the <ORDINAL> <NORP> settlement in the <NORP> Colonies</ss>
<ss>The 13 families who came to our new land were the forerunners of <MONEY> to the United States</ss>
<ss><DATE>, more <NORP> claim <NORP> ancestry than any other</ss>
<ss>These <NORP> cleared and cultivated our land, built our industries, and advanced our arts and sciences</ss>
<ss>In honor of <DATE> of <NORP> contributions in America, President <NORP> and I have agreed <DATE> that he will pay an official visit to the United States in <DATE> to celebrate the occasion</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people have given us so much, we like to think that we've repaid some of that debt</ss>
<ss><EVENT> was the <ORDINAL> revolution in modern history to be fought for the right of self-government and the guarantee of civil liberties</ss>
<ss>That spirit was contagious</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, <ORG> statement of basic human rights guaranteed freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and equality before the law</ss>
<ss>And these principles live <DATE> in the basic law of <ORG></ss>
<ss>Many peoples to the east still wait for such rights</ss>
<ss>The United States is proud of your democracy, but we cannot take credit for it</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, in speaking of those who built the awe-inspiring cathedrals of medieval times, said that, "In <DATE> people had convictions</ss>
<ss>We moderns have only opinions, and it requires something more than opinions," he said, "to build a Gothic cathedral</ss>
<ss>" Well, over <DATE>, the convictions of the <NORP> people have built a cathedral of democracy -- a great and glorious testament to your ideals</ss>
<ss>We in America genuinely admire the free society that you have built in <DATE>, and we understand all the better what you have accomplished because of our own history</ss>
<ss><NORP> speak with the deepest reverence of those <ORG> and <ORDINAL> citizens who gave us the freedom that we enjoy <DATE></ss>
<ss>And even though they lived <DATE>, we carry them in our hearts as well as in our history books</ss>
<ss>I believe future generations of <NORP> will look to you here <DATE> and to your fellow <NORP> with the same profound respect and appreciation</ss>
<ss>You have built a free society with an abiding faith in human dignity-the crowning ideal of <NORP> civilization</ss>
<ss>This will not be forgotten</ss>
<ss>You will be saluted and honored by this Republic's descendants over <DATE> to come</ss>
<ss><DATE>, before <ORG>, I spoke of the values of <NORP> civilization and the necessity to help all peoples gain the institutions of freedom</ss>
<ss>In many ways, in many places, our ideals are being tested <DATE></ss>
<ss>We are meeting <TIME> between two important summits -- the gathering of leading industrial democracies at <LOC> and the assembly of <ORG> here in Bonn <DATE></ss>
<ss>Critical and complex problems face us, but our dilemmas will be made easier if we remember our partnership is based on a common <NORP> heritage and a faith in democracy</ss>
<ss>I believe this partnership of <ORG> nations is motivated primarily by the search for peace -- inner peace for our citizens and peace among nations</ss>
<ss>Why inner peace? Because democracy allows for self-expression</ss>
<ss>It respects man's dignity and creativity</ss>
<ss>It operates by a rule of law, not by terror or coercion</ss>
<ss>It is government with the consent of the governed</ss>
<ss>As a result, citizens of <ORG> enjoy an unprecedented level of material and spiritual well-being, and they're free to find their own personal peace</ss>
<ss>We also seek peace among nations</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> said, "Seek peace and pursue it</ss>
<ss>" Well, our foreign policies are based on this principle and directed toward this end</ss>
<ss>The noblest objective of our diplomacy is the patient and difficult task of reconciling our adversaries to peace</ss>
<ss>And I know we all look forward to <DATE> when the only industry of man 1 will be the research of historians</ss>
<ss>But the simple hope for peace is not enough</ss>
<ss>We must remember something that <PERSON> said: "The most pious man can't stay in peace if it doesn't please his evil neighbor</ss>
<ss>" So, there must be a method to our search, a method that recognizes the dangers and realities of the world</ss>
<ss>During Chancellor <PERSON>'s state visit to Washington <DATE>, I said that your Republic was "perched on a cliff of freedom</ss>
<ss>" I wasn't saying anything the <NORP> people do not already know</ss>
<ss>Living as you do in the heart of a divided <LOC>, you can see more clearly than others that there are governments at peace neither with their own peoples nor the world</ss>
<ss>I don't believe any reasonable observer can deny that there is a threat to both peace and freedom <DATE></ss>
<ss>It is as stark as that gash of a border that separates the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>We're menaced by a power that openly condemns our values and answers our restraint with a relentless military buildup</ss>
<ss>We cannot simply assume every nation wants the peace that we so earnestly desire</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people would tell us there are those who would use military force to repress others who want only basic human rights</ss>
<ss>The freedom fighters of Afghanistan would tell us as well that the threat of aggression has not receded from the world</ss>
<ss>Without a strengthened <LOC> security, the possibility of military coercion will be very great</ss>
<ss>We must continue to improve our defenses if we're to preserve peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>This is</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Is there an echo in here?  But this preserving peace and freedom is not an impossible task</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, we have succeeded in deterring war</ss>
<ss>Our method has been to organize our defensive capabilities, both nuclear and conventional, so that an aggressor could have no hope of military victory</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> has carried its strength not as a battle flag, but as a banner of peace</ss>
<ss>Deterrence has kept that peace, and we must continue to take the steps necessary to make deterrence credible, This depends in part on a strong America</ss>
<ss>A national effort, entailing sacrifices by the <NORP> people, is now underway to make long-overdue improvements in our military posture</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people support this effort because they understand how fundamental it is to keeping the peace they so fervently desire</ss>
<ss>We also are resolved to maintain the presence of well-equipped and trained forces in <LOC>, and our strategic forces will be modernized and remain committed to the <ORG></ss>
<ss>By these actions, the people of the United States are saying, "We are with you <NORP>y; you are not alone</ss>
<ss>" Our adversaries would be foolishly mistaken should they gamble that <NORP> would abandon their <ORG> responsibilities, no matter how severe the test</ss>
<ss><ORG> security depends on a fully credible conventional defense to which all allies contribute</ss>
<ss>There is a danger that any conflict could escalate to a nuclear war</ss>
<ss>Strong conventional forces can make the danger of conventional or nuclear conflict more remote</ss>
<ss>Reasonable strength in and of itself is not bad; it is honorable when used to maintain peace or defend deeply held beliefs</ss>
<ss>One of the <ORDINAL> chores is to fulfill our commitments to each other by continuing to strengthen our conventional defenses</ss>
<ss>This must include improving the readiness of our standing forces and the ability of those forces to operate as one</ss>
<ss>We must also apply the <LOC>'s technological genius to improving our conventional deterrence</ss>
<ss>There can be no doubt that we as an <ORG> have the means to improve our conventional defenses</ss>
<ss>Our peoples hold values of individual liberty and dignity that time and again they've proven willing to defend</ss>
<ss>Our economic energy vastly exceeds that of our adversaries</ss>
<ss>Our free system has produced technological advances that other systems, with their stifling ideologies, cannot hope to equal</ss>
<ss>All of these resources are available to our defense</ss>
<ss>Yes, many of our nations currently are experiencing economic difficulties; yet we must nevertheless guarantee that our security does not suffer as a result</ss>
<ss>We've made strides in conventional defense over <DATE> despite our economic problems, and we've disproved the pessimists who contend that our efforts are futile</ss>
<ss>The more we close the conventional gap, the less the risks of aggression or nuclear conflict</ss>
<ss>The soil of <NORP>y and of every other Ally is of vital concern to each member of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>And this fundamental commitment is embodied in <LOC></ss>
<ss>But it will be an empty pledge unless we ensure that <NORP> forces are ready to reinforce <LOC>, and <LOC> is ready to receive them</ss>
<ss>I'm encouraged by the recent agreement on wartime host-nation support</ss>
<ss>This pact strengthens our ability to deter aggression in <LOC> and demonstrates our common determination to respond to attack</ss>
<ss>Just as each ally shares fully in the security of the <ORG>, each is responsible for shouldering a fair share of the burden</ss>
<ss>Now that, of course, often leads to a difference of opinion, and criticism of our <ORG> is as old as the partnership itself</ss>
<ss>But voices have now been raised on both sides of the <LOC> that mistake the inevitable process of adjustment within the <ORG> for a dramatic divergence of interests</ss>
<ss>Some <NORP> think that <NORP> are too little concerned for their own security</ss>
<ss>Some would unilaterally reduce the number of <NORP> troops deployed in <LOC></ss>
<ss>And in <LOC> itself, we hear the idea that the <NORP> presence, rather than contributing to peace, either has no deterrent value or actually increases the risk that our <ORG> may be attacked</ss>
<ss>These arguments ignore both the history and the reality of the transatlantic coalition</ss>
<ss>Let me assure you that the <NORP> commitment to <LOC> remains steady and strong</ss>
<ss><LOC>'s shores are our shores</ss>
<ss><LOC>'s borders are our borders</ss>
<ss>And we will stand with you in defense of our heritage of liberty and dignity</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people recognize <LOC>'s substantial contributions to our joint security</ss>
<ss>Nowhere is that contribution more evident than here in <ORG></ss>
<ss><NORP> citizens host the forces of six nations</ss>
<ss><NORP> soldiers and reservists provide the backbone of <ORG>'s conventional deterrent in the heartland of <LOC></ss>
<ss>Your Bundeswehr is a model for the integration of defense needs with a democratic way of life, and you have not shrunk from the heavy responsibility of accepting the nuclear forces necessary for deterrence</ss>
<ss>I ask your help in fulfilling another responsibility</ss>
<ss>Many <NORP> citizens don't believe that their counterparts in <LOC>, especially younger citizens, really understand the United States presence there</ss>
<ss>Now, if you'll work toward explaining the <NORP> role to people on this side of the <LOC>, I'll explain it to those on the other side</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, both in your country and mine, there has been renewed public concern about the threat of nuclear war and the arms buildup</ss>
<ss>I know it's not easy, especially for the <NORP> people, to live in the gale of intimidation that blows from the east</ss>
<ss>If I might quote <PERSON> again, he almost foretold the fears of nuclear war when he wrote, "Wild, dark times are rumbling toward us, and the prophet who wishes to write a new apocalypse will have to invent entirely new beasts, and beasts so terrible that the ancient animal symbols will seem like cooing doves and cupids in comparison</ss>
<ss>" The nuclear threat is a terrible beast</ss>
<ss>Perhaps the banner carried in one of the nuclear demonstrations here in <NORP>y said it best</ss>
<ss>The sign read, "I am afraid</ss>
<ss>" Well, I know of no <NORP> leader who doesn't sympathize with that earnest plea</ss>
<ss>To those who march for peace, my heart is with you</ss>
<ss>I would be at the head of your parade if I believed marching alone could bring about a more secure world</ss>
<ss>And to the 2,800 women in <ORG> who spent a petition for peace to President <PERSON> and me, let me say I, myself, would sign your petition if I thought it could bring about harmony</ss>
<ss>I understand your genuine concerns</ss>
<ss>The women of <ORG> and I share the same goal</ss>
<ss>The question is how to proceed</ss>
<ss>We must think through the consequences of how we reduce the dangers to peace</ss>
<ss>Those who advocate that we unilaterally forego the modernization of our forces must prove that this will enhance our security and lead to moderation by the other side-in short, that it will advance, rather than undermine, the preservation of the peace</ss>
<ss>The weight of recent history does not support this notion</ss>
<ss>Those who demand that we renounce the use of a crucial element of our deterrent strategy must show how this would decrease the likelihood of war</ss>
<ss>It is only by <PERSON> with a nuclear war that the suffering caused by conventional war seems a lesser evil</ss>
<ss>Our goal must be to deter war of any kind</ss>
<ss>And those who decry the failure of arms control efforts to achieve substantial results must consider where the fault lies</ss>
<ss>I would remind them that it is the United States that has proposed to ban land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles-the missiles most threatening to <LOC></ss>
<ss>It is the United States that has proposed and will pursue deep cuts in strategic systems</ss>
<ss>It is the <LOC> that has long sought the detailed exchanges of information on forces and effective verification procedures</ss>
<ss>And it is dictatorships, not democracies, that need militarism to control their own people and impose their system on others</ss>
<ss>To those who've taken a different viewpoint and who can't see this danger, I don't suggest that they're ignorant, it's just that they know so many things that aren't true</ss>
<ss>We in the <LOC> -- <NORP>, <NORP>, our other <ORG> -- are deeply committed to continuing efforts to restrict the arms competition</ss>
<ss>Common sense demands that we persevere</ss>
<ss>I invite those who genuinely seek effective and lasting arms control to stand behind the far-reaching proposals that we've put forward</ss>
<ss>In return, I pledge that we will sustain the closest of consultations with our <ORG></ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, I outlined a broad and ambitious arms control program</ss>
<ss>One element calls for reducing land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles to zero on each side</ss>
<ss>If carried out, it would eliminate the growing threat to <LOC> posed by the <NORP>S</ss>
<ss><NORP>'s modern SS-20 rockets, and it would make unnecessary the <ORG> decision to deploy <NORP> intermediate-range systems</ss>
<ss>And, by the way, I cannot understand why among some, there is a greater fear of weapons <ORG> is to deploy than of weapons the <NORP> Union already has deployed</ss>
<ss>Our proposal is fair because it imposes equal limits and obligations on both sides, and it calls for significant reductions, not merely a capping of an existing high level of destructive power</ss>
<ss>As you know, we've made this proposal in Geneva, where negotiations have been underway since <DATE></ss>
<ss>We intend to pursue those negotiations intensively</ss>
<ss>I regard them as a significant test of the <NORP>' willingness to enter into meaningful arms control agreements</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, we proposed to the <NORP> Union that <ORG> begin <DATE> in Geneva</ss>
<ss>The <NORP>S</ss>
<ss><NORP> has agreed, and talks will begin on <DATE></ss>
<ss>We in the United States want to focus on the most destabilizing systems, and thus reduce the risk of war</ss>
<ss>And that's why in the <ORDINAL> phase, we propose to reduce substantially the number of ballistic missile warheads and the missiles themselves</ss>
<ss>In the <ORDINAL> phase, we will seek an equal ceiling on other elements of our strategic forces, including ballistic missile throwweight, at less than current <NORP> levels</ss>
<ss>We will handle cruise missiles and bombers in an equitable fashion</ss>
<ss>We will negotiate in good faith and undertake these talks with the same seriousness of purpose that has marked our preparations over <DATE></ss>
<ss>Another element of the program I outlined was a call for reductions in conventional forces in <LOC></ss>
<ss>From <DATE>, the <NORP> democracies have faced the ominous reality that massive <NORP> conventional forces would remain stationed where they do not belong</ss>
<ss>The muscle of <NORP> forces in <LOC> far exceeds legitimate defense needs</ss>
<ss>Their presence is made more threatening still by a military doctrine that emphasizes mobility and surprise attack</ss>
<ss>And as history shows, these troops have built a legacy of intimidation and repression</ss>
<ss>In response, the <ORG> allies must show they have the will and capacity to deter any conventional attack or any attempt to intimidate us</ss>
<ss>Yet, we also will continue the search for responsible ways to reduce <ORG> and <ORG> military personnel to equal levels</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, we in the <ORG> have consulted on how best to invigorate the Vienna negotiations on <ORG></ss>
<ss>Based on these consultations, <NORP> representatives in the Vienna talks soon will make a proposal by which the two alliances would reduce their respective ground force personnel in verifiable stages to a total of 700,000 men and their combined ground and air force personnel to a level of 900,000 men</ss>
<ss>While the agreement would not eliminate the threat nor spare our citizens the task of maintaining a substantial defense force, it could constitute a major step toward a safer <LOC> for both <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>It could lead to military stability at lower levels and lessen the dangers of miscalculation and a surprise attack, and it also would demonstrate the political will of the two alliances to enhance stability by limiting their forces in the central area of their military competition</ss>
<ss>The <LOC> has established a clear set of goals</ss>
<ss>We, as an <ORG>, will press forward with plans to improve our own conventional forces in <LOC></ss>
<ss>At the same time, we propose an arms control agreement to equalize conventional forces at a significantly lower level</ss>
<ss>We will move ahead with our preparations to modernize our nuclear forces in <LOC></ss>
<ss>But, again, we also will work unceasingly to gain acceptance in Geneva of our proposal to ban land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>In the United States, we will move forward with the plans I announced <DATE> to modernize our strategic nuclear forces, which play so vital a role in maintaining peace by deterring war</ss>
<ss>Yet, we also have proposed that <ORG> begin</ss>
<ss>We will pursue them determinedly</ss>
<ss>In each of these areas, our policies are based on the conviction that a stable military balance at the lowest possible level will help further the cause of peace</ss>
<ss>The other side will respond in good faith to these initiatives only if it believes we are resolved to provide for our own defense</ss>
<ss>Unless convinced that we will unite and stay united behind these arms control initiatives and modernization programs, our adversaries will seek to divide us from one another and our people from their leaders</ss>
<ss>I'm optimistic about our relationship with the <NORP> Union if the <NORP> nations remain true to their values and true to each other</ss>
<ss>I believe in <NORP> civilization and its moral power</ss>
<ss>I believe deeply in the principles the <LOC> esteems</ss>
<ss>And guided by these ideals, I believe we can find a no-nonsense, workable, and lasting policy that will keep the peace</ss>
<ss>Earlier, I said the <NORP> people had built a remarkable cathedral of democracy</ss>
<ss>But we still have other work ahead</ss>
<ss>We must build a cathedral of peace, where nations are safe from war and where people need not fear for their liberties</ss>
<ss>I've heard the history of the famous cathedral of Cologne -- how those beautiful soaring spires miraculously survived the destruction all around them, including part of the church itself</ss>
<ss>Let us build a cathedral as the people of Cologne built theirs -- with the deepest commitment and determination</ss>
<ss>Let us build as they did-not just for ourselves but for the generations beyond</ss>
<ss>For if we construct our peace properly, it will endure as long as the spires of Cologne</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, Mr</ss>
<ss>President, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen: I speak <DATE> as both a citizen of the United States and of the world</ss>
<ss>I come with the heartfelt wishes of my people for peace, bearing honest proposals and looking for genuine progress</ss>
<ss>Dag <ORG> said <DATE>, "We meet in a time of peace, which is no peace</ss>
<ss>" His words are as true <DATE> as they were then</ss>
<ss>More than a hundred disputes have disturbed the peace among nations since <EVENT>, and <DATE> the threat of nuclear disaster hangs over the lives of all our people</ss>
<ss>The <PERSON> tells us there will be a time for peace, but so far <DATE> mankind has failed to find it</ss>
<ss><ORG> is dedicated to world peace, and its charter clearly prohibits the international use of force</ss>
<ss>Yet the tide of belligerence continues to rise</ss>
<ss>The charter's influence has weakened even in <DATE> since the <ORDINAL> special session on disarmament</ss>
<ss>We must not only condemn aggression; we must enforce the dictates of our charter and resume the struggle for peace</ss>
<ss>The record of history is clear: Citizens of the United States resort to force reluctantly and only when they must</ss>
<ss>Our foreign policy, as President <PERSON> once said, "is not difficult to state</ss>
<ss>We are for peace <ORDINAL>, last, and always for very simple reasons</ss>
<ss>" We know that only in a peaceful atmosphere, a peace with justice, one in which we can be confident, can America prosper as we have known prosperity in the past, he said</ss>
<ss>He said to those who challenge the truth of those words, let me point out, at the end of <EVENT>, we were the only undamaged industrial power in the world</ss>
<ss>Our military supremacy was unquestioned</ss>
<ss>We had harnessed the atom and had the ability to unleash its destructive force anywhere in the world</ss>
<ss>In short, we could have achieved world domination, but that was contrary to the character of our people</ss>
<ss>Instead, we wrote a new chapter in the history of mankind</ss>
<ss>We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war-ravaged economies of the world, both <LOC> and <LOC>, including those nations who had been our enemies</ss>
<ss>We took the initiative in creating such international institutions as <ORG>, where leaders of good will could come together to build bridges for peace and prosperity</ss>
<ss>America has no territorial ambitions</ss>
<ss>We occupy no countries, and we have built no walls to lock our people in</ss>
<ss>Our commitment to self-determination, freedom, and peace is the very soul of America</ss>
<ss>That commitment is as strong <DATE> as it ever was</ss>
<ss>The United States has fought four wars in my lifetime</ss>
<ss>In each, we struggled to defend freedom and democracy</ss>
<ss>We were never the aggressors</ss>
<ss>America's strength and, yes, her military power have been a force for peace, not conquest; for democracy, not despotism; for freedom, not tyranny</ss>
<ss>Watching, as I have, succeeding generations of <NORP> youth bleed their lives onto far-flung battlefields to protect our ideals and secure the rule of law, I have known how important it is to deter conflict</ss>
<ss>But since coming to the Presidency, the enormity of the responsibility of this office has made my commitment even deeper</ss>
<ss>I believe that responsibility is shared by all of us here <DATE></ss>
<ss>On our recent trip to <LOC>, my wife, <PERSON>, told me of a bronze statue, <QUANTITY> high, that she saw on a cliff on the coast of France</ss>
<ss>The beach at the base of the cliff is called <PERSON>, but countless <NORP> family <PERSON> have written it in on the flyleaf and know it as Omaha Beach</ss>
<ss>The pastoral quiet of that <NORP> countryside is in marked contrast to the bloody violence that took place there on a <DATE> <DATE> when the <ORG> stormed the Continent</ss>
<ss>At the end of just <DATE> of battle, 10,500 <NORP> were wounded, missing, or killed in what became known as the Normandy landing</ss>
<ss>The statue atop that cliff is called "<WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>" Its image of sacrifice is almost too powerful to describe</ss>
<ss>The pain of war is still vivid in our national memory</ss>
<ss>It sends me to this special session of <ORG> eager to comply with the plea of Pope <PERSON> when he spoke in this chamber <DATE></ss>
<ss>"If you want to be brothers," His <ORG> said, "let the arms fall from your hands</ss>
<ss>" Well, we <NORP> yearn to let them go</ss>
<ss>But we need more than mere words, more than empty promises before we can proceed</ss>
<ss>We look around the world and see rampant conflict and aggression</ss>
<ss>There are many sources of this conflict -- expansionist ambitions, local rivalries, the striving to obtain justice and security</ss>
<ss>We must all work to resolve such discords by peaceful means and to prevent them from escalation</ss>
<ss>In the nuclear era, the major powers bear a special responsibility to ease these sources of conflict and to refrain from aggression</ss>
<ss>And that's why we're so deeply concerned by <NORP> conduct</ss>
<ss>Since <EVENT>, the record of tyranny has included <NORP> violation of the <ORG> agreements leading to domination of <LOC>, symbolized by <FAC> -- a grim, gray monument to repression that I visited <DATE></ss>
<ss>It includes the takeovers of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Afghanistan; and the ruthless repression of the proud people of Poland</ss>
<ss><NORP>-sponsored guerrillas and terrorists are at work in Central and South America, in <LOC>, <LOC>, in the <LOC>, and in <LOC>, violating human rights and unnerving the world with violence</ss>
<ss><NORP> atrocities in <LOC>, Afghanistan, and elsewhere continue to shock the free world as refugees escape to tell of their horror</ss>
<ss><DATE> of so-called detente witnessed the most massive <NORP> buildup of military power in history</ss>
<ss>They increased their defense spending by <PERCENT> while <NORP> defense actually declined in the same real terms</ss>
<ss><NORP> aggression and support for violence around the world have eroded the confidence needed for arms negotiations</ss>
<ss>While we exercised unilateral restraint, they forged ahead and <DATE> possess nuclear and conventional forces far in excess of an adequate deterrent capability</ss>
<ss><NORP> oppression is not limited to the countries they invade</ss>
<ss>At the very time the <NORP> Union is trying to manipulate the peace movement in the <LOC>, it is stifling a budding peace movement at home</ss>
<ss>In Moscow, banners are scuttled, buttons are snatched, and demonstrators are arrested when even a few people dare to speak about their fears</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, one of our <ORDINAL> ambassadors to this body, reminded us that the high-sounding words of tyrants stand in bleak contradiction to their deeds</ss>
<ss>"Their promises," she said, "are in deep contrast to their performances</ss>
<ss>" My country learned a bitter lesson in <DATE>: The scourge of tyranny cannot be stopped with words alone</ss>
<ss>So, we have embarked on an effort to renew our strength that had fallen dangerously low</ss>
<ss>We refuse to become weaker while potential adversaries remain committed to their imperialist adventures</ss>
<ss>My people have sent me here <DATE> to speak for them as citizens of the world, which they truly are, for we <NORP> are drawn from every nationality represented in this chamber <DATE></ss>
<ss>We understand that men and women of every race and creed can and must work together for peace</ss>
<ss>We stand ready to take the next steps down the road of cooperation through verifiable arms reduction</ss>
<ss>Agreements on arms control and disarmament can be useful in reinforcing peace; but they're not magic</ss>
<ss>We should not confuse the signing of agreements with the solving of problems</ss>
<ss>Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace</ss>
<ss>Agreements genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept</ss>
<ss>Otherwise we're building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war</ss>
<ss>Let me repeat, we need deeds, not words, to convince us of <NORP> sincerity, should they choose to join us on this path</ss>
<ss>Since the end of <EVENT>, the United States has been the leader in serious disarmament and arms control proposals</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, in what became known as the <PERSON> plan, the United States submitted a proposal for control of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy by an international authority</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> rejected this plan</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> President <PERSON> made his "<WORK_OF_ART>" proposal, under which the United States and the <NORP> Union would have exchanged blueprints of military establishments and provided for aerial reconnaissance</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> rejected this plan</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> the Limited Test Ban <PRODUCT> came into force</ss>
<ss>This treaty ended nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, outer space, or under water by participating nations</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> the <PRODUCT> on <FAC> took effect</ss>
<ss>The United States played a major role in this key effort to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives and to provide for international safeguards on civil nuclear activities</ss>
<ss>My country remains deeply committed to those objectives <DATE>, and to strengthening the nonproliferation framework</ss>
<ss>This is essential to international security</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, again at United States urging, agreements were reached between the United States and the <LOC>S</ss>
<ss><NORP> providing for ceilings on some categories of weapons</ss>
<ss>They could have been more meaningful if <NORP> actions had shown restraint and commitment to stability at lower levels of force</ss>
<ss><ORG> designated the <DATE>'s as <EVENT></ss>
<ss>But good intentions were not enough</ss>
<ss>In reality that 10-year period included an unprecedented buildup in military weapons and the flaring of aggression and use of force in almost every region of the world</ss>
<ss>We are now in <EVENT></ss>
<ss>The task at hand is to assure civilized behavior among nations, to unite behind an agenda of peace</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, the United States has put forward a broad-based, comprehensive series of proposals to reduce the risk of war</ss>
<ss>We have proposed four major points as an agenda for peace: elimination of landbased, intermediate-range missiles; a onethird reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads; a substantial reduction in <ORG> and <ORG> ground and air forces; and new safeguards to reduce the risk of accidental war</ss>
<ss>We urge the <NORP> Union <DATE> to join with us in this quest</ss>
<ss>We must act not for ourselves alone, but for all mankind</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, I announced United States objectives in arms control agreements</ss>
<ss>They must be equitable and militarily significant</ss>
<ss>They must stabilize forces at lower levels, and they must be verifiable</ss>
<ss>The United States and its allies have made specific, reasonable, and equitable proposals</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, our negotiating team in Geneva offered the <NORP> Union a draft treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces</ss>
<ss>We offered to cancel deployment of our Pershing II ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles in exchange for <NORP> elimination of the SS-20, SS-4, and SS-5 missiles</ss>
<ss>This proposal would eliminate with one stroke those systems about which both sides have expressed the greatest concern</ss>
<ss>The United States is also looking forward to beginning negotiations on strategic arms reductions with the <NORP> Union in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We will work hard to make these talks an opportunity for real progress in our quest for peace</ss>
<ss>On <DATE> I announced a phased approach to the reduction of strategic arms</ss>
<ss>In a <ORDINAL> phase, the number of ballistic missile warheads on each side would be reduced to about 5,000</ss>
<ss>No more than half the remaining warheads would be on landbased missiles</ss>
<ss>All ballistic missiles would be reduced to an equal level, at about one-half the current United States number</ss>
<ss>In the <ORDINAL> phase, we would reduce each side's overall destructive power to equal levels, including a mutual ceiling on ballistic missile throw-weight below the current <LOC> level</ss>
<ss>We are also prepared to discuss other elements of the strategic balance</ss>
<ss>Before I returned from <LOC> <DATE>, I met in Bonn with the leaders of <ORG></ss>
<ss>We agreed to introduce a major new <NORP> initiative for the Vienna negotiations on <ORG></ss>
<ss>Our approach calls for common, collective ceilings for both <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>After <DATE>, there would be a total of 700,000 ground forces and 900,000 ground and air force personnel combined</ss>
<ss>It also includes a package of associated measures to encourage cooperation and verify compliance</ss>
<ss>We urge the <NORP> Union and members of <ORG> to view our <NORP> proposal as a means to reach agreement in Vienna after <DATE> of inconclusive talks</ss>
<ss>We also urge them to implement the <DATE> <NORP> agreement on security and cooperation in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Let me stress that for agreements to work, both sides must be able to verify compliance</ss>
<ss>The building of mutual confidence in compliance can only be achieved through greater openness</ss>
<ss>I encourage the special session on disarmament to endorse the importance of these principles in arms control agreements</ss>
<ss>I have instructed our representatives at <ORG> to renew emphasis on verification and compliance</ss>
<ss>Based on a <LOC> proposal, a committee has been formed to examine these issues as they relate to restrictions on nuclear testing</ss>
<ss>We are also pressing the need for effective verification provisions in agreements banning chemical weapons</ss>
<ss>The use of chemical and biological weapons has long been viewed with revulsion by civilized nations</ss>
<ss>No peacemaking institution can ignore the use of those dread weapons and still live up to its mission</ss>
<ss>The need for a truly effective and verifiable chemical weapons agreement has been highlighted by recent events</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union and their allies are violating <LAW>, related rules of international law, and the <DATE> <LAW></ss>
<ss>There is conclusive evidence that <ORG> has provided toxins for use in Laos and Kampuchea, and are themselves using chemical weapons against freedom-fighters in Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>We have repeatedly protested to <ORG>, as well as to the Governments of Laos and Vietnam, their use of chemical and toxin weapons</ss>
<ss>We call upon them now to grant full and free access to their countries or to territories they control so that <ORG> experts can conduct an effective, independent investigation to verify cessation of these horrors</ss>
<ss>Evidence of noncompliance with existing arms control agreements underscores the need to approach negotiation of any new agreements with care</ss>
<ss>The democracies of the <LOC> are open societies</ss>
<ss>Information on our defenses is available to our citizens, our elected officials, and the world</ss>
<ss>We do not hesitate to inform potential adversaries of our military forces and ask in return for the same information concerning theirs</ss>
<ss>The amount and type of military spending by a country is important for the world to know, as a measure of its intentions and the threat that country may pose to its neighbors</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union and other closed societies go to extraordinary lengths to hide their true military spending, not only from other nations but from their own people</ss>
<ss>This practice contributes to distrust and fear about their intentions</ss>
<ss><DATE>, the United States proposes an international conference on military expenditures to build on the work of this body in developing a common system for accounting and reporting</ss>
<ss>We urge the <NORP> Union, in particular, to join this effort in good faith, to revise the universally discredited official figures it publishes, and to join with us in giving the world a true account of the resources we allocate to our armed forces</ss>
<ss><DATE> in Berlin, I said that I would leave no stone unturned in the effort to reinforce peace and lessen the risk of war</ss>
<ss>It's been clear to me steps should be taken to improve mutual communication, confidence, and lessen the likelihood of misinterpretation</ss>
<ss>I have, therefore, directed the exploration of ways to increase understanding and communication between the United States and the <NORP> Union in times of peace and of crisis</ss>
<ss>We will approach the <NORP> Union with proposals for reciprocal exchanges in such areas as advance notification of major strategic exercises that otherwise might be misinterpreted; advance notification of ICBM launches within, as well as beyond, national boundaries; and an expanded exchange of strategic forces data</ss>
<ss>While substantial information on <LOC> activities and forces in these areas already is provided, I believe that jointly and regularly sharing information would represent a qualitative improvement in the strategic nuclear environment and would help reduce the chance of misunderstandings</ss>
<ss>I call upon the <NORP> Union to join the United States in exploring these possibilities to build confidence, and I ask for your support of our efforts</ss>
<ss>One of the major items before this conference is the development of a comprehensive program of disarmament</ss>
<ss>We support the effort to chart a course of realistic and effective measures in the quest for peace</ss>
<ss>I have come to this hall to call for international recommitment to the basic tenet of <LAW> -- that all members practice tolerance and live together in peace as good neighbors under the rule of law, forsaking armed force as a means of settling disputes between nations</ss>
<ss>America urges you to support the agenda for peace that I have outlined <DATE></ss>
<ss>We ask you to reinforce the bilateral and multilateral arms control negotiations between members of <ORG> and <ORG> and to rededicate yourselves to maintaining international peace and security, and removing threats to peace</ss>
<ss>We, who have signed the <NORP> N</ss>
<ss>Charter, have pledged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territory or independence of any state</ss>
<ss>In these times when more and more lawless acts are going unpunished -- as some members of this very body show a growing disregard for the <NORP> N</ss>
<ss>Charter -- the peace-loving nations of the world must condemn aggression and pledge again to act in a way that is worthy of the ideals that we have endorsed</ss>
<ss>Let us finally make the charter live</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, <DATE>, representatives of 50 nations gathered on the other side of this continent, in <ORG></ss>
<ss><ORG> had crumbled, and <EVENT> still raged</ss>
<ss>But those men and nations were determined to find peace</ss>
<ss>The result was this charter for peace that is the framework of <ORG></ss>
<ss>President <PERSON> spoke of the revival of an old faith</ss>
<ss>He said the everlasting moral force of justice prompting that <ORG> -- such a force remains strong in America and in other countries where speech is free and citizens have the right to gather and make their opinions known</ss>
<ss>And President <PERSON> said, "If we should pay merely lip service to inspiring ideals, and later do violence to simple justice, we would draw down upon us the bitter wrath of generations yet unborn</ss>
<ss>" Those words of <PERSON> have special meaning for us <DATE> as we live with the potential to destroy civilization</ss>
<ss>"We must learn to live together in peace," he said</ss>
<ss>"We must build a new world -- a far better world</ss>
<ss>" What a better world it would be if the guns were silent, if neighbor no longer encroached on neighbor, and all peoples were free to reap the rewards of their toil and determine their own destiny and system of government, whatever their choice</ss>
<ss>During my recent audience with His <ORG> Pope <PERSON>, I gave him the pledge of the <NORP> people to do everything possible for peace and arms reduction</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people believe forging real and lasting peace to be their sacred trust</ss>
<ss>Let us never forget that such a peace would be a terrible hoax if the world were no longer blessed with freedom and respect for human rights</ss>
<ss>"<ORG>," <ORG> said, "was born out of the cataclysms of war</ss>
<ss>It should justify the sacrifices of all those who have died for freedom and justice</ss>
<ss>It is our duty to the past</ss>

<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: There's an old saying we've all heard a thousand times about the weather and how everyone talks about it but no one does anything about it</ss>
<ss>Well, many of you must be feeling that way about the present state of our economy</ss>
<ss>Certainly there's a lot of talk about it, but I want you to know we're doing something about it</ss>
<ss>And the reason I wanted to talk to you is because you can help us do something about it</ss>
<ss>Believe me, if some of you are confused, I can understand why</ss>
<ss>For some time, ever since we started planning the <DATE> budget for <DATE> beginning <DATE> <DATE>, there's been a steady drumbeat of "reports" on what we're supposed to be doing</ss>
<ss>I know you've read and heard on the news a variety of statements attributed to various "authoritative government sources who prefer not to have their names used</ss>
<ss>" Well, you know my name, and I think I'm an authoritative source on this since I'm right in the middle of what's going on here</ss>
<ss>So, I'd like to set the record straight on a few of the things that you might have heard lately</ss>
<ss>I'm sure you've heard that "we're proposing the largest single tax increase in history</ss>
<ss>" The truth is, we're proposing nothing of the kind</ss>
<ss>And then there's the one that "our economic recovery program has failed, so I've abandoned it and turned to increasing taxes instead of trying to reduce Federal spending</ss>
<ss>" Well, don't you believe that one either</ss>
<ss>Yes, there is a tax bill before the <ORG> tied to a program of further cuts in spending</ss>
<ss>It is not, however, the "greatest single tax increase in history</ss>
<ss>" Possibly it could be called the greatest tax reform in history, but it absolutely does not represent any reversal of policy or philosophy on the part of this administration or this President</ss>
<ss>Now, you may have heard that some special interests oppose this bill</ss>
<ss>And that's right; some do</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, some in the <ORG> of my own party object to this bill -- and strongly</ss>
<ss>I'm told by many that this bill is not politically popular, and it may not be</ss>
<ss>Why then do I support it? I support it because it's right for America</ss>
<ss>I support it because it's fair</ss>
<ss>I support it because it will, when combined with our cuts in government spending, reduce interest rates and put more <NORP> back to work again</ss>
<ss>Now, you'll recall that when our administration came into office <DATE>, we announced a plan for economic recovery</ss>
<ss>Recovery from what? From a <DATE> recession that saw inflation in double-digit figures for <DATE></ss>
<ss>It was <PERCENT> when we arrived</ss>
<ss>Interest rates had gone into outer space</ss>
<ss>They were at the highest they'd been in <DATE> with a prime rate that hit 2<MONEY> ? percent</ss>
<ss>There were almost 8 million <NORP> out of work</ss>
<ss>And in several hard-hit industrial States, there already were pockets of unemployment reaching figures of <MONEY>5, <DATE>, and even <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>I went to those areas; I know</ss>
<ss>The cost of government was increasing at a rate of <PERCENT> a year</ss>
<ss>There was little we could do about the budget already in place</ss>
<ss>But we could do something about the one that had been proposed for <DATE> beginning in <DATE></ss>
<ss>I'd campaigned on the belief that government costs should be reduced and that the percentage of the people's earnings taken by government in taxes should also be reduced</ss>
<ss>I also said that one area of government spending could not be reduced, but must instead be increased</ss>
<ss>That was the spending necessary to restore our nation's defenses, which had been allowed to deteriorate to a dangerous degree in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Interest rates continued high as <DATE> went by, and unemployment increased, particularly in the automobile industry and housing construction</ss>
<ss>Few could or would afford the high interest rates for home mortgages or installment buying of an automobile</ss>
<ss>Meantime, we were putting our economic recovery program in place</ss>
<ss>It wasn't easy</ss>
<ss>We didn't get all the cuts we wanted</ss>
<ss>And we got some tax measures we didn't want</ss>
<ss>But we were charting a complete turnaround in government policy, and we did get the major part of what we proposed</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> mandated spending cuts of <MONEY> over <DATE> and adopted the biggest tax cut in history</ss>
<ss>Now, this, too, was to be implemented over a 3-year period</ss>
<ss>It began with a 5-percent cut in the personal income tax beginning <DATE>, then a <MONEY>0-percent cut this <DATE>, and another scheduled for <DATE></ss>
<ss>These will be followed by indexing of the tax brackets so workers getting cost-of-living pay raises won't be moved up into higher brackets</ss>
<ss>We have to realize inflation itself is a tax</ss>
<ss>Government profits by inflation, but indexing will put a stop to that</ss>
<ss>There were tax cuts for business and industry to help provide capital for modernization of plant and equipment, changes in the estate tax, capital gains tax, and the marriage-penalty tax</ss>
<ss>Some who supported us on the spending cuts were fearful about cutting taxes in view of the continuing budget deficits</ss>
<ss>We felt that tax cuts had to be a part of our plan in order to provide incentive for individuals and for business to increase productivity and thus create jobs for the unemployed</ss>
<ss>Now, it's only been <DATE> since the <ORDINAL> phase of our program went into effect</ss>
<ss>As I said earlier, there are those who say it's been tried and it failed</ss>
<ss>Well, as <PERSON> used to say, "Let's look at the record</ss>
<ss>" Start with interest rates, the basic cause of the present recession: The prime rate was, as I said, <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Well, <DATE> it was <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>And as of <DATE>, three major banks have lowered it to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss><DATE> 90-day <ORG> bills were paying <PERCENT> interest</ss>
<ss><DATE> they were paying <MONEY>5 <MONEY>/2</ss>
<ss>That double-digit inflation, <PERCENT>, has been cut in half for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Real earnings are at last increasing for the <ORDINAL> time in quite a long time</ss>
<ss>Personal savings, which trended downward throughout <DATE>, are increasing</ss>
<ss>This means more money in the pool of investment capital</ss>
<ss>This will help further reduce interest rates</ss>
<ss>All of this in <DATE> hardly looks like a program that failed to me</ss>
<ss>Oh, yes, I failed to mention that in <DATE> just ended there was an increase in economic growth -- the <ORDINAL> such increase in a long time</ss>
<ss>Our biggest problem -- the last one to be solved in every recession -- is unemployment</ss>
<ss>I understand how tough it is for those who are waiting for the jobs that come with recovery</ss>
<ss>We can have no rest until our neighbors, our fellow citizens who want to work, are able once again to find jobs</ss>
<ss>Again, let me say, the main obstacle to their doing so is continued high interest rates</ss>
<ss>Those rates should be lower now than they are, with the success we've had in reducing inflation</ss>
<ss>But part of the problem is psychological -- a pessimism in the money markets that we won't stay the course and continue lowering the cost of government</ss>
<ss>The projected increase in budget deficits has added to that pessimism and fear</ss>
<ss>And this brings us back to that so-called greatest tax increase in history and the budget proposals now before the <ORG></ss>
<ss>When I submitted the <DATE> budget to the <ORG> in <DATE>, it contained very significant spending cuts on top of those we obtained <DATE></ss>
<ss>This time, however, we couldn't get the support we had <DATE></ss>
<ss>Some who had not been happy about the tax cuts then were now insisting we must have additional tax revenues</ss>
<ss>In fact, they wanted to cancel the reduction scheduled for <DATE> and cancel the indexing of tax brackets</ss>
<ss>Others proposed tax increases mounting to <MONEY> over a 3-year period</ss>
<ss>On top of this, there was resistance to the spending reductions we asked for, and even attempts to eliminate some of <DATE> cuts so as to actually increase spending</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> now we've been working to get a compromise budget that would further reduce spending and thus reduce the deficits</ss>
<ss>We also have stood firm on retaining the tax cuts already in place, because, as I said, they're essential to restoring the economy</ss>
<ss>We did, however, agree to limited revenue increases so long as they didn't harm the incentive features of our economic recovery program</ss>
<ss>We ourselves, <DATE>, had called attention to the possibility of better compliance with the tax laws -- collecting taxes legitimately owed but which were not being paid</ss>
<ss>Well, <DATE> and <DATE> of negotiations resulted in a congressional budget resolution combining revenue increases and further spending reductions</ss>
<ss>Revenues would increase over a 3-year period by <MONEY>, and outlays in that same period would be reduced by 280 billion</ss>
<ss>Now, as you can see, that figures out to about a 3-to-<MONEY> ratio -- <MONEY> less in spending outlays for each $<MONEY> of increased revenue</ss>
<ss>This compromise adds up to a total over <DATE> of a <MONEY> reduction in the budget deficits</ss>
<ss>And remember, our original tax reduction remains in place, which means your taxes will still be cut <MONEY> in <DATE>, even with the passage of this present tax bill</ss>
<ss>Now, let me take that <MONEY> tax program apart, and you decide whether it's the biggest tax increase in history</ss>
<ss>Of <MONEY>, 32 billion is collection of tax presently owed under the present laws and which is not being paid</ss>
<ss>Now, to all of you who are paying your tax, simple fairness says we should collect from those who are freeloading</ss>
<ss><MONEY> of the 99 billion represents closing off special-interest loopholes which have resulted in unintended tax advantages for some -- not all -- taxpayers, some who are financially well able to pay their share</ss>
<ss>Now, this is also a matter of simple fairness</ss>
<ss>So, <PERCENT> of the tax bill is not new tax at all, but is better collecting and correcting of flaws in the system</ss>
<ss>Now, this leaves <MONEY> over <DATE> of actual new taxes, which is far outweighed by the tax cuts which will benefit individuals</ss>
<ss>There is an excise tax on cigarettes, another on telephones</ss>
<ss>Well, for people who smoke a pack a day, that tax will mean an increase of <MONEY> a month</ss>
<ss>The telephone tax increase is <MONEY> a month for the average household</ss>
<ss>Right now the tax reduction that we passed <DATE> is saving the average family <MONEY> per year</ss>
<ss><DATE>, even after this new tax bill is passed, the savings will almost double; they'll go to $<MONEY></ss>
<ss>And here's what the totals look like</ss>
<ss>The new tax reform will raise in <DATE> about, as I say, 99 billion</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, as I said a moment ago, our tax-cut program even after this increase will save you 335 billion</ss>
<ss>Within the new bill there has, of course, been disagreement over some of the specific provisions</ss>
<ss>For example, there's considerable confusion over the proposal to have withholding of tax due on interest and dividends, just as it's withheld now on your wages and salaries</ss>
<ss>Many senior citizens have been led to believe this is a new tax added on top of the present income tax</ss>
<ss>Well, there is no truth whatsoever to that</ss>
<ss>We found that while the overwhelming majority of <NORP> faithfully report income from interest and dividends and pay taxes on it, some do not</ss>
<ss>It's one of the significant areas of noncompliance and is costing the government <MONEY> a year</ss>
<ss>In the case of those over <DATE>, withholding will only apply to those with incomes of $<MONEY> and up per individual and $<MONEY> for couples filing a joint return</ss>
<ss>Low-income citizens below 65 will be exempt if their income is less than <MONEY> for an individual or <MONEY>5,300 for those filing joint returns</ss>
<ss>And there will be an exemption for all interest payments of $<MONEY> or less</ss>
<ss>The only people whose taxes will be increased by this withholding are those who presently are evading their fair share of the tax burden</ss>
<ss>Once again, we're striving to see that all taxpayers are treated fairly</ss>
<ss>Now, this withholding will go into effect <DATE>, not <DATE>, as was earlier reported</ss>
<ss>Back during the campaign -- n <DATE>, to be exact -- I said my goal was to reduce by <DATE> the share of the gross national product taken by the government in taxes, reduce it to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>If we had done nothing, it would have risen to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>But even after passage of this bill, <ORG> in <DATE> will only be taking <PERCENT> of the gross national product</ss>
<ss>Make no mistake about it, this whole package is a compromise</ss>
<ss>I had to swallow hard to agree to any revenue increase</ss>
<ss>But there are two sides to a compromise</ss>
<ss>Those who supported the increased revenues swallowed hard to accept <MONEY> in outlay cuts</ss>
<ss>Others have accepted specific provisions with regard to taxes or spending cuts which they opposed</ss>
<ss>There's a provision in the bill for extended unemployment payments in States particularly hard hit by unemployment</ss>
<ss>If this provision is not enacted, 2 million unemployed people will use up their benefits by <DATE></ss>
<ss>I repeat: Much of this bill will make our tax system more fair for every <NORP>, especially those in lower income brackets</ss>
<ss>I'm still dedicated to reducing the level of spending until it's within our income, and I still want to see the base of the economy broadened so that the individual's tax burden can be further reduced</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, growth in government and deficit spending have been built into our system</ss>
<ss>Now, it'd be nice if we could just cut that out of our system with a single, sharp slice</ss>
<ss>That, however, can't be done without bringing great hardship down on many of our less fortunate</ss>
<ss>neighbors who are not in a position to provide for themselves</ss>
<ss>And none of us wants that</ss>
<ss>Our effort to restore fiscal integrity and common sense to the Federal establishment isn't limited to the budget cuts and tax policy</ss>
<ss>Vice President <PERSON> heads up a task force that's been reviewing excessive regulations</ss>
<ss>Already enough unnecessary and duplicative regulations have been eliminated or revised to save <MONEY> <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our Inspectors General have been mobilized into a task force aimed at ferreting out waste and fraud</ss>
<ss>They've conducted tens of thousands of audits, secured thousands of indictments resulting in many convictions</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> alone, they found <MONEY> of savings and improved use of funds</ss>
<ss>Computer cross-checking has uncovered thousands of government checks still going to people who've been dead for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Task forces from the private sector are engaged in a study of the management structure of government</ss>
<ss>What they've learned already indicates a great potential for savings by simply bringing government procedures up to ordinary modern business standards</ss>
<ss>Our private sector initiatives force, under <PERSON>, has uncovered hundreds of community and statewide projects performing services voluntarily that once were thought to be the province of government</ss>
<ss>Some of the most innovative have to do with job training and placement, particularly for young people</ss>
<ss>What we need now is an end to the bickering here in the <LOC></ss>
<ss>We need the bipartisan, comprehensive package of revenue increases and spending cuts now before the <ORG></ss>
<ss>We need it to be passed</ss>
<ss>We're not proposing a quick fix, an artificial stimulant to the economy, such as we've seen in the several recessions in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The present recession is bottoming out without resorting to quick fixes</ss>
<ss>Now, there won't be a sudden boom or upsurge</ss>
<ss>But slowly and surely, we'll have a sound and lasting recovery based on solid values and increased productivity and an end to deficit spending</ss>
<ss>It may not be easy, but it's the best way, the only way to real and lasting prosperity for all our people</ss>
<ss>Think of it, we've only had one balanced budget in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Let's look forward to <DATE> when we begin making payments to reduce the national debt, instead of turning it all over to our children</ss>
<ss>You helped us start this economic recovery program <DATE> when you told your representatives you wanted it</ss>
<ss>You can help again -- whether you're a <NORP>, a <NORP>, or an Independent -- by letting them know that you want it continued, letting them know that you understand that this legislation is a price worth paying for lower interest rates, economic recovery, and more jobs</ss>
<ss>The single most important question facing us <TIME> is, do we reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying their fair share? Or do we accept bigger budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment simply because we disagree on certain features of a legislative package which offers hope for millions of <NORP> at home, on the farm, and in the workplace? Do we tell these <NORP> to give up hope, that their ship of state lies dead in the water because those entrusted with manning that ship can't agree on which sail to raise? We're within sight of the safe port of economic recovery</ss>
<ss>Do we make port or go aground on the shoals of selfishness, partisanship, and just plain bullheadedness? The measure the <ORG> is about to vote on, while not perfect in the eyes of any one of us, will bring us closer to the goal of a balanced budget, restored industrial power, and employment for all who want to work</ss>
<ss>Together we can reach that goal</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>God bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: Today has been <DATE> that should make us proud</ss>
<ss>It marked the end of the successful evacuation of <ORG> from Beirut, Lebanon</ss>
<ss>This peaceful step could never have been taken without the good offices of the United <ORG>s and especially the truly heroic work of a great <NORP> diplomat, Ambassador <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Thanks to his efforts, I'm happy to announce that the <PERSON> Marine contingent helping to supervise the evacuation has accomplished its mission</ss>
<ss>Our young men should be out of Lebanon within <DATE></ss>
<ss>They, too, have served the cause of peace with distinction, and we can all be very proud of them</ss>
<ss>But the situation in Lebanon is only part of the overall problem of conflict in <LOC></ss>
<ss>So, over <DATE>, while events in Beirut dominated the front page, America was engaged in a quiet, behind-the-scenes effort to lay the groundwork for a broader peace in the region</ss>
<ss>For once there were no premature leaks as <PERSON> diplomatic missions traveled to <LOC> capitals, and I met here at home with a wide range of experts to map out an <NORP> peace initiative for the long-suffering peoples of <LOC> -- <NORP> and <NORP> alike</ss>
<ss>It seemed to me that with the agreement in Lebanon we had an opportunity for a more far-reaching peace effort in the region, and I was determined to seize that moment</ss>
<ss>In the words of the scripture, the time had come to "follow after the things which make for peace</ss>
<ss>" <TIME> I want to report to you the steps we've taken and the prospects they can open up for a just and lasting peace in <LOC></ss>
<ss>America has long been committed to bringing peace to this troubled region</ss>
<ss>For more than a generation, successive United <ORG>s administrations have endeavored to develop a fair and workable process that could lead to a true and lasting <NORP>-<NORP> peace</ss>
<ss>Our involvement in the search for <LOC> peace is not a matter of preference; it's a moral imperative</ss>
<ss>The strategic importance of the region to the United <ORG>s is well known, but our policy is motivated by more than strategic interests</ss>
<ss>We also have an irreversible commitment to the survival and territorial integrity of friendly states</ss>
<ss>Nor can we ignore the fact that the well-being of much of the world's economy is tied to stability in the strife-torn <LOC></ss>
<ss>Finally, our traditional humanitarian concerns dictated a continuing effort to peacefully resolve conflicts</ss>
<ss>When our administration assumed office in <DATE>, I decided that the general framework for our <LOC> policy should follow the broad guidelines laid down by my predecessors</ss>
<ss>There were two basic issues we had to address</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, there was the strategic threat to the region posed by the <NORP> Union and its surrogates, best demonstrated by the brutal war in Afghanistan, and, <ORDINAL>, the peace process between Israel and its <NORP> neighbors</ss>
<ss>With regard to the <NORP> threat, we have strengthened our efforts to develop with our friends and allies a joint policy to deter the <NORP> and their surrogates from further expansion in the region and, if necessary, to defend against it</ss>
<ss>With respect to the <NORP>-<NORP> conflict, we've embraced the <FAC> framework as the only way to proceed</ss>
<ss>We have also recognized, however, solving the <NORP>-<NORP> conflict in and of itself cannot assure peace throughout a region as vast and troubled as <LOC></ss>
<ss>Our first objective under the <FAC> process was to ensure the successful fulfillment of the <NORP>-<NORP> peace treaty</ss>
<ss>This was achieved with the peaceful return of the <LOC> to Egypt in <DATE></ss>
<ss>To accomplish this, we worked hard with our <NORP> and <NORP> friends and, eventually, with other friendly countries to create the multinational force which now operates in the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Throughout this period of difficult and time-consuming negotiations, we never lost sight of the next step of <FAC> -- autonomy talks to pave the way for permitting the <NORP> people to exercise their legitimate rights</ss>
<ss>However, owing to the tragic assassination of President <PERSON> and other crises in the area, it was not until <DATE> that we were able to make a major effort to renew these talks</ss>
<ss>Secretary of <ORG> <PERSON> and Ambassador <PERSON> made three visits to Israel and Egypt <DATE> to pursue the autonomy talks</ss>
<ss>Considerable progress was made in developing the basic outline of an <NORP> approach which was to be presented to Egypt and Israel after <DATE></ss>
<ss>The successful completion of Israel's withdrawal from <LOC> and the courage shown on this occasion by Prime Minister <PERSON> and President <PERSON> in living up to their agreements convinced me the time had come for a new <NORP> policy to try to bridge the remaining differences between Egypt and Israel on the autonomy process</ss>
<ss>So, in <DATE> called for specific measures and a timetable for consultations with the Governments of Egypt and Israel on the next steps in the peace process</ss>
<ss>However, before this effort could be launched, the conflict in Lebanon preempted our efforts</ss>
<ss>The autonomy talks were basically put on hold while we sought to untangle the parties in Lebanon and still the guns of war</ss>
<ss><EVENT>, tragic as it was, has left us with a new opportunity for <LOC> peace</ss>
<ss>We must seize it now and bring peace to this troubled area so vital to world stability while there is still time</ss>
<ss>It was with this strong conviction that over <DATE>, before the present negotiations in Beirut had been completed, I directed Secretary of <ORG> <PERSON> to again review our policy and to consult a wide range of outstanding <NORP> on the best ways to strengthen chances for peace in <LOC></ss>
<ss>We have consulted with many of the officials who were historically involved in the process, with Members of the <ORG>, and with individuals from the private sector</ss>
<ss>And I have held extensive consultations with my own advisers on the principles that I will outline to you <TIME></ss>
<ss>The evacuation of the <ORG> from Beirut is now complete, and we can now help the <NORP> to rebuild their war-torn country</ss>
<ss>We owe it to ourselves and to posterity to move quickly to build upon this achievement</ss>
<ss>A stable and revived Lebanon is essential to all our hopes for peace in the region</ss>
<ss>The people of Lebanon deserve the best efforts of the international community to turn the nightmares of <DATE> into a new dawn of hope</ss>
<ss>But the opportunities for peace in <LOC> do not begin and end in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>As we help Lebanon rebuild, we must also move to resolve the root causes of conflict between <NORP> and <NORP></ss>
<ss>The war in Lebanon has demonstrated many things, but two consequences are key to the peace process</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>; the military losses of the <ORG> have not diminished the yearning of the <NORP> people for a just solution of their claims; and, <ORDINAL>, while Israel's military successes in Lebanon have demonstrated that its armed forces are <ORDINAL> to none in the region, they alone cannot bring just and lasting peace to Israel and her neighbors</ss>
<ss>The question now is how to reconcile Israel's legitimate security concerns with the legitimate rights of the <NORP></ss>
<ss>And that answer can only come at the negotiating table</ss>
<ss>Each party must recognize that the outcome must be acceptable to all and that true peace will require compromises by all</ss>
<ss>So, <TIME> I'm calling for a fresh start</ss>
<ss>This is the moment for all those directly concerned to get involved -- or lend their support -- to a workable basis for peace</ss>
<ss>The <FAC> agreement remains the foundation of our policy</ss>
<ss>Its language provides all parties with the leeway they need for successful negotiations</ss>
<ss>I call on Israel to make clear that the security for which she yearns can only be achieved through genuine peace, a peace requiring magnanimity, vision, and courage</ss>
<ss>I call on the <NORP> people to recognize that their own political aspirations are inextricably bound to recognition of Israel's right to a secure future</ss>
<ss>And I call on the <NORP> <ORG>s to accept the reality of Israel -- and the reality that peace and justice are to be gained only through hard, fair, direct negotiation</ss>
<ss>In making these calls upon others, I recognize that the United <ORG>s has a special responsibility</ss>
<ss>No other nation is in a position to deal with the key parties to the conflict on the basis of trust and reliability</ss>
<ss>The time has come for a new realism on the part of all the peoples of <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <ORG> of Israel is an accomplished fact; it deserves unchallenged legitimacy within the community of nations</ss>
<ss>But Israel's legitimacy has thus far been recognized by too few countries and has been denied by every <NORP> <ORG> except Egypt</ss>
<ss>Israel exists; it has a right to exist in peace behind secure and defensible borders; and it has a right to demand of its neighbors that they recognize those facts</ss>
<ss>I have personally followed and supported Israel's heroic struggle for survival, ever since the founding of the <ORG> of Israel <DATE></ss>
<ss>In the <DATE> borders Israel was <QUANTITY> wide at its narrowest point</ss>
<ss>The bulk of Israel's population lived within artillery range of hostile <NORP> armies</ss>
<ss>I am not about to ask Israel to live that way again</ss>
<ss>The war in Lebanon has demonstrated another reality in the region</ss>
<ss>The departure of the <NORP> from Beirut dramatizes more than ever the homelessness of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss><NORP> feel strongly that their cause is more than a question of refugees</ss>
<ss>I agree</ss>
<ss>The <FAC> agreement recognized that fact when it spoke of the legitimate rights of the <NORP> people and their just requirements</ss>
<ss>For peace to endure it must involve all those who have been most deeply affected by the conflict</ss>
<ss>Only through broader participation in the peace process, most immediately by Jordan and by the <NORP>, will Israel be able to rest confident in the knowledge that its security and integrity will be respected by its neighbors</ss>
<ss>Only through the process of negotiation can all the nations of <LOC> achieve a secure peace</ss>
<ss>These, then, are our general goals</ss>
<ss>What are the specific new <NORP> positions, and why are we taking them? In the <FAC> talks thus far, both Israel and Egypt have felt free to express openly their views as to what the outcome should be</ss>
<ss>Understandably their views have differed on many points</ss>
<ss>The United <ORG>s has thus far sought to play the role of mediator</ss>
<ss>We have avoided public comment on the key issues</ss>
<ss>We have always recognized and continue to recognize that only the voluntary agreement of those parties most directly involved in the conflict can provide an enduring solution</ss>
<ss>But it's become evident to me that some clearer sense of America's position on the key issues is necessary to encourage wider support for the peace process</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, as outlined in the <FAC> accords, there must be a period of time during which the <NORP> inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza will have full autonomy over their own affairs</ss>
<ss>Due consideration must be given to the principle of self-government by the inhabitants of the territories and to the legitimate security concerns of the parties involved</ss>
<ss>The purpose of the 5-year period of transition which would begin after free elections for a self-governing <NORP> authority is to prove to the <NORP> that they can run their own affairs and that such <NORP> autonomy poses no threat to Israel's security</ss>
<ss>The United <ORG>s will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements during the transitional period</ss>
<ss>Indeed, the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel, more than any other action, could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks</ss>
<ss>Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel and only diminishes the confidence of the <NORP> that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated</ss>
<ss>I want to make the <NORP> position well understood</ss>
<ss>The purpose of this transitional period is the peaceful and orderly transfer of authority from Israel to the <NORP> inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza</ss>
<ss>At the same time, such a transfer must not interfere with Israel's security requirements</ss>
<ss>Beyond the transition period, as we look to the future of the West Bank and Gaza, it is clear to me that peace cannot be achieved by the formation of an independent <NORP> state in those territories, nor is it achievable on the basis of <NORP> sovereignty or permanent control over the West Bank and Gaza</ss>
<ss>So, the United <ORG>s will not support the establishment of an independent <NORP> state in the West Bank and Gaza, and we will not support annexation or permanent control by Israel</ss>
<ss>There is, however, another way to peace</ss>
<ss>The final status of these lands must, of course, be reached through the give and take of negotiations</ss>
<ss>But it is the firm view of the United <ORG>s that self-government by the <NORP> of the West Bank and Gaza in association with Jordan offers the best chance for a durable, just, and lasting peace</ss>
<ss>We base our approach squarely on the principle that the <NORP>-<NORP> conflict should be resolved through negotiations involving an exchange of territory for peace</ss>
<ss>This exchange is enshrined in <ORG> <LAW>, which is, in turn, incorporated in all its parts in the <FAC> agreements</ss>
<ss><PERSON> 242 remains wholly valid as the foundation stone of America's <LOC> peace effort</ss>
<ss>It is the United <ORG>s position that, in return for peace, the withdrawal provision of <LAW> applies to all fronts, including the West Bank and Gaza</ss>
<ss>When the border is negotiated between Jordan and Israel, our view on the extent to which Israel should be asked to give up territory will be heavily affected by the extent of true peace and normalization, and the security arrangements offered in return</ss>
<ss>Finally, we remain convinced that Jerusalem must remain undivided, but its final status should be decided through negotiation</ss>
<ss>In the course of the negotiations to come, the United <ORG>s will support positions that seem to us fair and reasonable compromises and likely to promote a sound agreement</ss>
<ss>We will also put forward our own detailed proposals when we believe they can be helpful</ss>
<ss>And, make no mistake, the United <ORG>s will oppose any proposal from any party and at any point in the negotiating process that threatens the security of Israel</ss>
<ss>America's commitment to the security of Israel is ironclad, and, I might add, so is mine</ss>
<ss>During <DATE>, our Ambassadors in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi <NORP>ia have presented to their host governments the proposals, in full detail, that I have outlined here <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now I'm convinced that these proposals can bring justice, bring security, and bring durability to an <NORP>-<NORP> peace</ss>
<ss>The United <ORG>s will stand by these principles with total dedication</ss>
<ss>They are fully consistent with Israel's security requirements and the aspirations of the <NORP></ss>
<ss>We will work hard to broaden participation at the peace table as envisaged by the <FAC> accords</ss>
<ss>And I fervently hope that the <NORP> and Jordan, with the support of their <NORP> colleagues, will accept this opportunity</ss>
<ss>Tragic turmoil in <LOC> runs back to the dawn of history</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, conflict after conflict has taken its brutal toll there</ss>
<ss>In an age of nuclear challenge and economic interdependence, such conflicts are a threat to all the people of the world, not just <LOC> itself</ss>
<ss>It's time for us all -- in <LOC> and around the world -- to call a halt to conflict, hatred, and prejudice</ss>
<ss>It's time for us all to launch a common effort for reconstruction, peace, and progress</ss>
<ss>It has often been said -- and, regrettably, too often been true -- that the story of the search for peace and justice in <LOC> is a tragedy of opportunities missed</ss>
<ss>In the aftermath of the settlement in Lebanon, we now face an opportunity for a broader peace</ss>
<ss>This time we must not let it slip from our grasp</ss>
<ss>We must look beyond the difficulties and obstacles of the present and move with a fairness and resolve toward a brighter future</ss>
<ss>We owe it to ourselves -- and to posterity -- to do no less</ss>
<ss>For if we miss this chance to make a fresh start, we may look back on this moment from some later vantage point and realize how much that failure cost us all</ss>
<ss>These, then, are the principles upon which <NORP> policy toward the <NORP>-<NORP> conflict will be based</ss>
<ss>I have made a personal commitment to see that they endure and, <PERSON> willing, that they will come to be seen by all reasonable, compassionate people as fair, achievable, and in the interests of all who wish to see peace in <LOC></ss>
<ss><TIME>, on the eve of what can be a dawning of new hope for the people of the troubled <LOC> -- and for all the world's people who dream of a just and peaceful future -- I ask you, my fellow <NORP>, for your support and your prayers in this great undertaking</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and <PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: The scenes that the whole world witnessed <DATE> were among the most heart-rending in the long nightmare of Lebanon's agony</ss>
<ss>Millions of us have seen pictures of the <NORP> victims of this tragedy</ss>
<ss>There is little that words can add, but there are actions we can and must take to bring that nightmare to an end</ss>
<ss>It's not enough for us to view this as some remote event in which we, ourselves, are not involved</ss>
<ss>For our friends in Lebanon and Israel, for our friends in <LOC> and elsewhere in <LOC>, and for us as <NORP>, this tragedy, horrible as it is, reminds us of the absolute imperative of bringing peace to that troubled country and region</ss>
<ss>By working for peace in <LOC>, we serve the cause of world peace and the future of mankind</ss>
<ss>For the criminals who did this deed, no punishment is enough to remove the blot of their crime</ss>
<ss>But for the rest of us, there are things that we can learn and things that we must do</ss>
<ss>The people of Lebanon must have learned that the cycle of massacre upon massacre must end</ss>
<ss>Children are not avenged by the murder of other children</ss>
<ss>Israel must have learned that there is no way it can impose its own solutions on hatreds as deep and bitter as those that produced this tragedy</ss>
<ss>If it seeks to do so, it will only sink more deeply into the quagmire that looms before it</ss>
<ss>Those outsiders who have fed the flames of civil war in Lebanon for so many years need to learn that the fire will consume them, too, if it is not put out</ss>
<ss>And we must all rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace</ss>
<ss>I reemphasize my call for early progress to solve the <NORP> issue and repeat the U</ss>
<ss>S</ss>
<ss>proposals which are now even more urgent</ss>
<ss>For now is not the time for talk alone; now is a time for action-to act together to restore peace to Beirut, to help a stable government emerge that can restore peace and independence to all of Lebanon, and to bring a just and lasting resolution to the conflict between Israel and its <NORP> neighbors, one that satisfies the legitimate rights of the <NORP>, who are all too often its victims</ss>
<ss>Our basic objectives in Lebanon have not changed, for they're the objectives of the Government and the people of Lebanon themselves</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> and foremost, we seek the restoration of a strong and stable central government in that country, brought into being by orderly constitutional processes</ss>
<ss>Lebanon elected a new President <DATE>, only to see him murdered even before he could assume his office</ss>
<ss><DATE> a distressed Lebanon will again be electing a new President</ss>
<ss>May <PERSON> grant him safety as well as the wisdom and courage to lead his country into a new and happier era</ss>
<ss>The international community has an obligation to assist <ORG> in reasserting authority over all its territory</ss>
<ss>Foreign forces and armed factions have too long obstructed the legitimate role of <ORG> security forces</ss>
<ss>We must pave the way for withdrawal of foreign forces</ss>
<ss>The place to begin this task is in Beirut</ss>
<ss><ORG> must be permitted to restore internal security in its capital</ss>
<ss>It cannot do this if foreign forces remain in or near Beirut</ss>
<ss>With this goal in mind, I have consulted with our <NORP> and <NORP> allies</ss>
<ss>We have agreed to form a new multinational force, similar to the one which served so well <DATE>, with the mission of enabling the <NORP> Government to resume full sovereignty over its capital, the essential precondition for extending its control over the entire country</ss>
<ss><ORG>, with the support of its people, requested this help</ss>
<ss>For this multinational force to succeed, it is essential that Israel withdraw from Beirut</ss>
<ss>With the expected cooperation of all parties, the multinational force will return to Beirut for a limited period of time</ss>
<ss>Its purpose is not to act as a police force, but to make it possible for the lawful authorities of Lebanon to discharge those duties for themselves</ss>
<ss>Secretary <PERSON>, on my behalf, has also reiterated our views to the Government of Israel through its Ambassador in Washington</ss>
<ss>Unless Israel moves quickly and courageously to withdraw, it will find itself ever more deeply involved in problems that are not its own and which it cannot solve</ss>
<ss>The participation of <NORP> forces in Beirut will again be for a limited period</ss>
<ss>But I've concluded there is no alternative to their returning to Lebanon if that country is to have a chance to stand on its own feet</ss>
<ss>Peace in Beirut is only a <ORDINAL> step</ss>
<ss>Together with the people of Lebanon, we seek the removal of all foreign military forces from that country</ss>
<ss>The departure of all foreign forces at the request of the <NORP> authorities has been widely endorsed by <NORP> as well as other states</ss>
<ss>Israel and Syria have both indicated that they have no territorial ambitions in Lebanon and are prepared to withdraw</ss>
<ss>It is now urgent that specific arrangements for withdrawal of all foreign forces be agreed upon</ss>
<ss>This must happen very soon</ss>
<ss>The legitimate security concerns of neighboring states, including, particularly, the safety of Israel's northern population, must be provided for</ss>
<ss>But this is not a difficult task, if the political will is there</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people must be allowed to chart their own future</ss>
<ss>They must rely solely on <ORG> who are willing and able to bring security to their country</ss>
<ss>They must be allowed to do so, and the sooner the better</ss>
<ss>Ambassador <PERSON>, who's been in close consultation with the parties concerned in Lebanon, will remain in the area to work for the full implementation of our proposal</ss>
<ss>Ambassador <PERSON> will join him, will represent me at the inauguration of the new President of Lebanon, and will consult with the leaders in the area</ss>
<ss>He will return promptly to Washington to report to me</ss>
<ss>Early in <DATE>, our government met its responsibility to help resolve a severe crisis and to relieve the <NORP> people of a crushing burden</ss>
<ss>We succeeded</ss>
<ss>Recent events have produced new problems, and we must again assume our responsibility</ss>
<ss>I am especially anxious to end the agony of Lebanon because it is both right and in our national interest</ss>
<ss>But I am also determined to press ahead on the broader effort to achieve peace between Israel and its <NORP> neighbors</ss>
<ss>The events in Beirut of <DATE> have served only to reinforce my conviction that such a peace is desperately needed and that the initiative we undertook on <DATE> is the right way to proceed</ss>
<ss>We will not be discouraged or deterred in our efforts to seek peace in Lebanon and a just and lasting peace throughout <LOC></ss>
<ss>All of us must learn the appropriate lessons from this tragedy and assume the responsibilities that it imposes upon us</ss>
<ss>We owe it to ourselves and to our children</ss>
<ss>The whole world will be a safer place when this region which has known so much trouble can begin to know peace instead</ss>
<ss>Both our purpose and our actions are peaceful, and we're taking them in a spirit of international cooperation</ss>
<ss>So, <TIME>, I ask for your prayers and your support as our country continues its vital role as a leader for world peace, a role that all of us as <NORP> can be proud of</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and <PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Ladies and gentlemen, Mr</ss>
<ss>Chairman, reverend clergy, <PERSON>, I thank you very much for those very kind words, and I thank all of you for certainly a most hearty and warm welcome</ss>
<ss>I'm grateful to <ORG>, Young <NORP> for <ORG>, and <ORG> for organizing this <ORDINAL> <DATE> memorial service for the <NORP> platform of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Someone asked me why I wanted to make it three in a row</ss>
<ss>Well, you know how the <NORP> love wakes</ss>
<ss>But I'm delighted to be back here with you, at your <ORDINAL> <DATE> conference</ss>
<ss>In my last two addresses, I've talked about our common perceptions and goals, and I thought I might report to you here <TIME> on where we stand in achieving those goals -- a sort of state of the <PERSON> report, if you will</ss>
<ss>Now, I'm the <ORDINAL> to acknowledge that there's a good deal left unfinished on the conservative agenda</ss>
<ss>Our cleanup crew will need <DATE> to deal with the mess left by others for <DATE></ss>
<ss>But I'm not disheartened</ss>
<ss>In fact, my attitude about that unfinished agenda isn't very different from that expressed in an anecdote about one of my favorite Presidents, <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Some of you may know that after Cal <PERSON> was introduced to the sport of fishing by his <ORG> detail, it got to be quite a passion with him, if you can use that word about "<WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>" Anyway, he was once asked by reporters how many fish were in one of his favorite angling places, <LOC></ss>
<ss>And <PERSON> said the waters were estimated to carry 45,000 trout</ss>
<ss>And then he said, "I haven't caught them all yet, but I sure have intimidated them</ss>
<ss>" Well, it's true we haven't brought about every change important to the conscience of a conservative, but we <NORP> can take a great deal of honest pride in what we have achieved</ss>
<ss>In <TIME> I want to talk about just how far we've come and what we need to do to win further victories</ss>
<ss>But right now, I think a word or two on strategy is in order</ss>
<ss>You may remember that in the past, I mentioned that it was not our task as <NORP> to just point out the mistakes made over <DATE> of liberal government, not just to form an able opposition, but to govern, to lead a nation</ss>
<ss>And I noted this would make new demands upon our movement, upon all of us</ss>
<ss>For the <ORDINAL> time in <DATE>, we've developed a whole new cadre of young <NORP> in government</ss>
<ss>We've shown that <NORP> can do more than criticize; we've shown that we can govern and move our legislation through the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Now, I know there's concern over attempts to roll back some of the gains that we've made</ss>
<ss>And it seems to me that here we ought to give some thought to strategy -- to making sure that we stop and think before we act</ss>
<ss>For example, some of our critics have been saying recently that they want to take back the people's <DATE> tax cut and abolish tax indexing</ss>
<ss>And some others, including members of my staff, wanted immediately to open up a verbal barrage against them</ss>
<ss>Well, I hope you know that sometimes it's better if a President doesn't say exactly what's on his mind</ss>
<ss>There's an old story about a farmer and a lawyer that illustrates my point</ss>
<ss>It seems that these two got into a pretty bad collision, a traffic accident</ss>
<ss>They both got out of their cars</ss>
<ss>The farmer took one look at the lawyer, walked back to his car, got a package, brought it back</ss>
<ss>There was a bottle inside, and he said, "Here, you look pretty shook up</ss>
<ss>I think you ought to take a nip of this, it'll steady your nerves</ss>
<ss>" Well, the lawyer did</ss>
<ss>And the farmer said, "You still look a little bit pale</ss>
<ss>How about another?" And the lawyer took another swallow</ss>
<ss>And under the urging of the farmer, he took another and another and another</ss>
<ss>And then, finally, he said he was feeling pretty good and asked the farmer if he didn't think that he ought to have a little nip, too</ss>
<ss>And the farmer said, "Not me, I'm waiting for the <ORG> trooper</ss>
<ss>" I wonder if we can't learn something from that farmer</ss>
<ss>If our liberal friends really want to head into the next election under the banner of taking away from the <NORP> people their <ORDINAL> real tax cut in <DATE>; if, after peering into their heart of hearts, they feel they must tell the <NORP> people that over <DATE> they want to reduce the income of an average family by $<MONEY>; and if they want to voice these deeply held convictions in <DATE> -- well, fellow <NORP>, who are we to stifle the voices of conscience? Now, in talking about our legislative agenda, I know that some of you have been disturbed by the notion of standby tax increases in the so-called <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, I wasn't wild about the idea myself</ss>
<ss>But the economy is getting better, and I believe these improvements are only the beginning</ss>
<ss>And with some luck, and if the <NORP> people respond with the kind of energy and initiative they've always shown in the past, well, maybe it's time we started thinking about some standby tax cuts, too</ss>
<ss>But you know, the great thing about that standby tax increase is that if it's passed, they can't put it into effect unless they have <ORDINAL> agreed to all our spending cuts</ss>
<ss>It does give them something to think about</ss>
<ss>But you know, with regard to the economy, I wonder if our political adversaries haven't once again proved that they're our best allies</ss>
<ss>They spent <DATE> or so placing all the responsibility for the state of the economy on our shoulders</ss>
<ss>And with some help from the media, it's been a pretty impressive campaign</ss>
<ss>They've created quite an image -- we're responsible for the economy</ss>
<ss>Well, I assume that we're responsible then for inflation which, after back-to-back <DATE> in double digits before we got here, has now been reduced to <PERCENT> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>And for <DATE>, it ran at <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> real wages increased for the <ORDINAL> time in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Interest rates, as you've already been told, have dropped dramatically, with the prime rate shrinking by <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>And in <DATE>, the index of leading indicators was a full <PERCENT> above <DATE> low point and has risen in 8 of <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE> housing starts were up <PERCENT> and building permits <PERCENT> over <DATE> at this time</ss>
<ss>New home sales are up by <PERCENT> since <DATE>, and inventories of unsold homes are at the lowest levels in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Auto production <DATE> is scheduled to increase by <PERCENT>, and <ORG> alone is putting 21,400 of their workers back on the job</ss>
<ss><DATE> sharp decline in the unemployment rate was the most heartening sign of all</ss>
<ss>It would have taken a <MONEY> jobs bill to reduce unemployment by the same amount -- and it didn't cost us anything</ss>
<ss>It's time to admit our guilt, time we admitted that our liberal critics have been right all the time</ss>
<ss>And they should go right on telling the <NORP> people that the state of the economy is precisely the fault of that wicked creature, <PERSON> and its havoc-breaking truth, <ORG></ss>
<ss>Let's confess, let's admit that we've turned the corner on the economy</ss>
<ss>And we're especially proud of one thing: When we hit heavy weather, we didn't panic, we didn't go for fast bromides and quick fixes, the huge tax increases or wage and price controls recommended by so many</ss>
<ss>And our stubbornness, if you want to call it that, will quite literally pay off for every <NORP> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>So, let me pledge to you <TIME>: Carefully, we have set out on the road to recovery</ss>
<ss>We will not be deterred</ss>
<ss>We will not be turned back</ss>
<ss>I reject the policies of the past, the policies of tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect</ss>
<ss>The lesson of these failed policies is clear; I've said this before: You can't drink yourself sober or spend yourself rich, and you can't prime the pump without pumping the prime -- as somebody did, like to <PERCENT> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>And a word is in order here on the most historic of all the legislative reforms we've achieved in <DATE> -- that of tax indexing</ss>
<ss>You can understand the terror that strikes in the heart of those whose principal constituency is big government</ss>
<ss>Bracket creep is government's hidden incentive to inflate the currency and bring on inflation, and indexing will end that</ss>
<ss>It will end those huge, hidden subsidies for bigger and bigger government</ss>
<ss>In the future, if we get indexing planted firmly as a law of the land, the advocates of big government who want money, more money for their social spending, their social engineering schemes, will have to go to the people and say right out loud: We want more money from your <DATE> paycheck, so we're raising your taxes</ss>
<ss>Do that instead of sneaking it out by way of inflation, which they have helped bring on</ss>
<ss>So, all the professional <NORP>, from bureaucrats to lobbyists to the special interest groups, are frightened -- plain scared -- and they're working overtime to take this one back</ss>
<ss>Well, I think I speak for all <NORP> when I say: Tax indexing is nonnegotiable</ss>
<ss>It's a fight we'll take to the people, and we'll win</ss>
<ss>But I think you can see how even this debate shows things are changing for the better</ss>
<ss>It highlights the essential differences between two philosophies now contending for power in <NORP> political life</ss>
<ss>One is the philosophy of the past -- a philosophy that has as its constituents an ill-assorted mix of elitists and special-interest groups who see government as the principal vehicle of social change, who believe that the only thing we have to fear is the people, who must be watched and regulated and superintended from Washington</ss>
<ss>On the other hand, our political philosophy is at the heart of the new political consensus that emerged in America at <DATE>, one that I believe all -- well, I believe it will dominate <NORP> politics for <DATE></ss>
<ss>The economic disasters brought about by too much government were the catalysts for this consensus</ss>
<ss>During the seventies, the <NORP> people began to see misdirected, overgrown government as the source of many of our social problems -- not the solution</ss>
<ss>This new consensus has a view of government that's essentially that of our <ORG> -- that government is the servant, not the master; that it was meant to maintain order, to protect our nation's safety, but otherwise, in the words of that noted political philosopher, schnozzle <PERSON>, "Don't put no constrictions on da people</ss>
<ss>Leave 'em da heck alone</ss>
<ss>" The overriding goal during <DATE> has been to give the government back to the <NORP> people, to make it responsive again to their wishes and desires, to do more than bring about a healthy economy or a growing gross national product</ss>
<ss>We've truly brought about a quiet revolution in <ORG></ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, bureaucratic self-interest and political maneuvering held sway over efficiency and honesty in government</ss>
<ss><ORG> dollars were treated as the property of bureaucrats, not taxpayers</ss>
<ss>Those in <ORG> who pointed to the misuse of those dollars were looked upon as malcontents or troublemakers</ss>
<ss>Well, this administration has broken with what was a kind of a buddy system</ss>
<ss>There have been dramatic turnabouts in some of the more scandal-ridden and wasteful <ORG> agencies and programs</ss>
<ss><DATE>, <ORG> was racked by indictments and report after report of inefficiency and waste</ss>
<ss><DATE> at <ORG>, <PERSON> has not only put the whistle-blowers back in charge, he's promoted them and given them new responsibilities</ss>
<ss>Just listen to this little set of figures</ss>
<ss><DATE>, <ORG> work-in-progress time is down from <DATE> to 7, even while the agency has sustained budget cuts of <PERCENT>, office space reductions of <PERCENT>, and the attrition of 7,000 employees</ss>
<ss>At <ORG>, under <PERSON>, losses of <MONEY> have suddenly been ended as the workforce was cut through attrition and a hiring freeze, and overtime pay was cut by <MONEY> in <DATE> alone</ss>
<ss>The Government publication program, which ran a cumulative loss of <MONEY> over a 3-year period, registered a <MONEY> profit, and the <ORG> as a whole has experienced a profit of <MONEY> <DATE></ss>
<ss>It is said by some that this administration has turned a blind eye to waste and fraud at the <ORG> while overzealously concentrating on the social programs</ss>
<ss>Well, at the <ORG>, under <PERSON> leadership and our superb service Secretaries, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>, we have identified <MONEY> in savings on waste and fraud and, over <DATE>, multiyear procurement and other acquisition initiatives will save us <MONEY></ss>
<ss>Now, these are only three examples of what we're attempting to do to make government more efficient</ss>
<ss>The list goes on</ss>
<ss>We have wielded our inspectors general as a strike force accounting for <MONEY> in savings in <DATE></ss>
<ss>With <PERSON> help, we've called on top management executives and experts from the private sector to suggest modern management techniques for every aspect of government operations</ss>
<ss>And with an exciting new project called <FAC>, we're going to streamline and reorganize the processes that control the money, information, personnel, and property of the <ORG> bureaucracy -- the maze through which <MONEY> passes <DATE> and which includes 350 different payroll systems and 1,750 personnel offices</ss>
<ss>There is more, much more -- from cutting down wasteful travel practices to reducing paperwork, from aggressively pursuing the <MONEY> in bad debts owed <ORG> to reducing publication of more than 70 million copies of wasteful or unnecessary government publications</ss>
<ss>But, you know, making government responsive again to the people involves more than eliminating waste and fraud and inefficiency</ss>
<ss>During <DATE> when government was intruding into areas where it's neither competent nor needed, it was also ignoring its legitimate and constitutional duties such as preserving the domestic peace and providing for the common defense</ss>
<ss>I'll talk about defense in a moment</ss>
<ss>I know you've already heard about that <DATE>, some of you</ss>
<ss>But on the matter of domestic order, a few things need to be said</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> of all, it is abundantly clear that much of our crime problem was provoked by a social philosophy that saw man as primarily a creature of his material environment</ss>
<ss>The same liberal philosophy that saw an era of prosperity and virtue ushered in by changing man's environment through massive <ORG> spending programs also viewed criminals as the unfortunate products of poor socioeconomic conditions or an underprivileged upbringing</ss>
<ss>Society, not the individual, they said, was at fault for criminal wrongdoing</ss>
<ss>We were to blame</ss>
<ss>Well, <DATE>, a new political consensus utterly rejects this point of view</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people demand that government exercise its legitimate and constitutional duty to punish career criminals -- those who consciously choose to make their life by preying on the innocent</ss>
<ss>Now, we <NORP> have been warning about the crime problem for <DATE>, about that permissive social philosophy that did so much to foster it, about a legal system that seemed to specialize in letting hardened criminals go free</ss>
<ss>And now we have the means and the power to do something</ss>
<ss>Let's get to work</ss>
<ss>Drugpusher after drugpusher, <PERSON> after <PERSON> has escaped justice by taking advantage of our flawed bail and parole system</ss>
<ss>Criminals who have committed atrocious acts have cynically utilized the technicalities of the exclusionary rule, a miscarriage of justice unique to our legal system</ss>
<ss>Indeed, one <ORG> study showed that of those arrested for drug felonies in Los Angeles County in <DATE>, <PERCENT> were back out on the streets because of perceived problems with the exclusionary rule</ss>
<ss>Now, the exclusionary rule -- that isn't a law that was passed by <ORG> or a <ORG> legislature, it's what is called case law, the result of judicial decisions</ss>
<ss>If a law enforcement officer obtains evidence as the result of a violation of the laws regarding search and seizure, that evidence cannot be introduced in a trial even if it proves the guilt of the accused</ss>
<ss>Now, this is hardly punishment of the officer for his violation of legal procedures, and it's only effect, in many cases, is to free someone patently guilty of a crime</ss>
<ss>I don't know, maybe I've told you this before, but I have to give you a glaring example of what I've taken too much time to explain here</ss>
<ss>San Bernardino, California, <DATE>: Two narcotics agents, based on the evidence that they had, obtained a legal warrant to search a home of a man and woman suspected of peddling heroin</ss>
<ss>They searched the home</ss>
<ss>They didn't find anything</ss>
<ss>But as they were leaving, just on a hunch, they turned back to the baby in the crib and took down the diapers, and there was the stash of heroin</ss>
<ss>The evidence was thrown out of court and the couple went free because the baby hadn't given permission for the violation of its constitutional rights</ss>
<ss>Well, this administration has proposed vital reforms of our bail and parole systems and criminal forfeiture and sentencing statutes</ss>
<ss>These reforms were passed by the <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our anticrime package never got out of committee in <ORG></ss>
<ss>Do you see a target there? The <NORP> people want these reforms, and they want them now</ss>
<ss>I'm asking <TIME> that you mobilize all the powerful resources of this political movement to get these measures passed by the <ORG></ss>
<ss>On another front, all of you know how vitally important it is for us to reverse the decline in <NORP> education, to take responsibility for the education of our children out of the hands of the bureaucrats and put it back in the hands of parents and teachers</ss>
<ss>That's why the <ORG> must stop dithering</ss>
<ss>We need those tuition tax credits</ss>
<ss>We need a voucher system for the parents of disadvantaged children</ss>
<ss>We need education savings accounts, a sort of IRA for college</ss>
<ss>And finally -- and don't think for a moment I've given up -- we need to eliminate that unnecessary and politically engendered <ORG></ss>
<ss>There are other steps we're taking to restore government to its rightful duties, to restore the political consensus upon which this nation was founded</ss>
<ss>Our <ORG> prohibited a <ORG> establishment of religion, but there is no evidence that they intended to set up a wall of separation between the state and religious belief itself</ss>
<ss>The evidence of this is all around us</ss>
<ss>In the Declaration of Independence, alone, there are no fewer than four mentions of a Supreme Being</ss>
<ss>"In God We Trust" is engraved on our coinage</ss>
<ss><ORG> opens its proceedings with a religious invocation</ss>
<ss>And the <ORG> opens <DATE> with prayer from its chaplains</ss>
<ss>The schoolchildren of the United <ORG>s are entitled to the same privileges as <ORG> Justices and <ORG>men</ss>
<ss>Join me in persuading the <ORG> to accede to the overwhelming desire of the <NORP> people for a constitutional amendment permitting prayer in our schools</ss>
<ss>And finally, on our domestic agenda, there is a subject that weighs heavily on all of us -- the tragedy of abortion on demand</ss>
<ss>This is a grave moral evil and one that requires the fullest discussion on the floors of the <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>As we saw in <DATE> with the issue of slavery, any attempt by the <ORG> to stifle or compromise away discussion of important moral issues only further inflames emotions on both sides and leads ultimately to even more social disruption and disunity</ss>
<ss>So, <TIME>, I would ask that the <ORG> discuss the issue of abortion openly and freely on the floors of the <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>Let those who believe the practice of abortion to be a moral evil join us in taking this case to our fellow <NORP></ss>
<ss>And let us do so rationally, calmly, and with an honest regard for our fellow <NORP></ss>
<ss>Speaking for myself, I believe that once the implications of abortion on demand are fully aired and understood by the <NORP> people, they will resolutely seek its abolition</ss>
<ss>Now, I know there are many who sincerely believe that limiting the right of abortion violates the freedom of choice of the individual</ss>
<ss>But if the unborn child is a living entity, then there are two individuals, each with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness</ss>
<ss>Unless and until someone can prove the unborn is not alive -- and all medical evidence indicates it is -- then we must concede the benefit of the doubt to the unborn infant</ss>
<ss>But whether it's cutting spending and taxing, shrinking the size of the deficit, ending overregulation, inefficiency, fraud, and waste in government, cracking down on career criminals, revitalizing <NORP> education, pressing for prayer and abortion legislation, I think you can see that the agenda we've put before America <DATE> has been a conservative one</ss>
<ss>Oh, and there are two other matters that I think you'd be interested in</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, as part of our federalism effort, <DATE> we will be sending to the <ORG> our proposal for four megablock grants that will return vital prerogatives to the <ORG>s where they belong</ss>
<ss>And <ORDINAL>, <ORG> will press ahead with new regulations prohibiting the use of <ORG> tax dollars for purposes of political advocacy</ss>
<ss>And these important domestic initiatives have been complemented by the conservative ideas we've brought to the pursuit of foreign policy</ss>
<ss>In the struggle now going on for the world, we have not been afraid to characterize our adversaries for what they are</ss>
<ss>We have focused world attention on forced labor on the <NORP> pipeline and <NORP> repression in Poland and all the other nations that make up what is called the "<ORDINAL> world" -- those living under <NORP> rule who long for freedom</ss>
<ss>We publicized the evidence of chemical warfare and other atrocities in Cambodia, which we're now supposed to call <PERSON>, and in Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>We pointed out that <NORP> powers hold a radically different view of morality and human dignity than we do</ss>
<ss>We must develop a forward strategy for freedom, one based on our hope that someday representative government will be enjoyed by all the people and all the nations of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>We've been striving to give the world the facts about the international arms race</ss>
<ss>Ever since our nearly total demobilization after <EVENT>, we in the <LOC> have been playing catchup</ss>
<ss>Yes, there's been an international arms race, as some of the declared <NORP> candidates for the Presidency tell us</ss>
<ss>But let them also tell us, there's only been one side doing the racing</ss>
<ss>Those of you in the frontline of the conservative movement can be of special assistance in furthering our strategy for freedom, our fight against <NORP>ism</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> of all, there is no more important foreign policy initiative in this administration, and none that frightens our adversaries more, than our attempts through our international radios to build constituencies for peace in nations dominated by <NORP>, militaristic regimes</ss>
<ss>We've proposed to the <ORG> modest but vitally important expenditures for <ORG>, <ORG>, and <ORG></ss>
<ss>These proposals stalled <DATE>, but with your help we can get them through the <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>And believe me, nothing could mean more to the <NORP>, <NORP>, <NORP>, and all the millions of others living in that <ORDINAL> world</ss>
<ss>Now, it would be also unconscionable during any discussion of the need for candor in our foreign policy not to mention here the tragic event that <DATE> shocked the world -- the attack on His Holiness, Pope <PERSON> -- an act of unspeakable evil, an assault on man and God</ss>
<ss>It was an international outrage and merits the fullest possible investigation</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I want to take this opportunity to applaud the courage and resourcefulness of <ORG> in bringing this matter to the attention of the world</ss>
<ss>And, contrary to what some have suggested, you can depend on it, there is no one on our side that is acting embarrassed or feeling embarrassed because they're going ahead with that investigation</ss>
<ss>We mean to help them</ss>
<ss>And, now, <PERSON>, you can breathe easy, because here we come</ss>
<ss>We must continue to revitalize and strengthen our <ORG></ss>
<ss><PERSON> been waging an heroic's battle on this front</ss>
<ss>I'm asking you, the conservative leaders here <TIME>, to make support for our defense buildup one of your top priorities</ss>
<ss>But besides progress in furthering all of these items on the conservative agenda, something else is occurring -- something that someday we <NORP> may be very proud happened under our leadership</ss>
<ss>Even with all our recent economic hardships, I believe a feeling of optimism is now entering the <NORP> consciousness, a belief that the <DATE> of division and discord are behind us and that an era of unity and national renewal is upon us</ss>
<ss>A vivid reminder of how our nation has learned and grown and transcended the tragedies of the past was given to us here in Washington <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE>, on the <LOC>, between <FAC> and <FAC>, a new memorial was dedicated -- one of dark, low-lying walls inscribed with the names of those who gave their lives in <EVENT></ss>
<ss>Soon, there will be added a sculpture of three infantrymen representing different racial and ethnic backgrounds</ss>
<ss>During the dedication ceremonies, the rolls of the missing and dead were read for <DATE>, <TIME>, in a candlelight ceremony at <FAC></ss>
<ss>And those veterans of Vietnam who were never welcomed home with speeches and bands, but who were undefeated in battle and were heroes as surely as any who ever fought in a noble cause, staged their own parade on <FAC></ss>
<ss>As America watched them, some in wheelchairs, all of them proud, there was a feeling that as a nation we were coming together, coming together again, and that we had at long last brought the boys home</ss>
<ss>"A lot of healing</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>went on," said <PERSON>, the wounded combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial</ss>
<ss>And then there was this newspaper account that appeared after the ceremonies</ss>
<ss>I'd like to read it to you</ss>
<ss>"<DATE>, crowds returned to the memorial</ss>
<ss>Among them was <PERSON>, a machinist and former marine from New Orleans</ss>
<ss>'<TIME>,' he said, standing near the wall, 'I went out to dinner with some ex-marines</ss>
<ss>There was also a group of college students in the restaurant</ss>
<ss>We started talking to each other, and before we left, they stood up and cheered</ss>
<ss>'<DATE>,' <ORG> said, his eyes red, 'it was worth it just for that</ss>
<ss>'" It has been worth it</ss>
<ss>We <NORP> have learned again to listen to each other, to trust each other</ss>
<ss>We've learned that government owes the people an explanation and needs their support for its actions at home and abroad</ss>
<ss>And we've learned -- and I pray this time for good -- that we must never again send our young men to fight and die in conflicts that our leaders are not prepared to win</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss>Yet, the most valuable lesson of all, the preciousness of human freedom, has been relearned not just by <NORP> but all the people of the world</ss>
<ss>It is "the stark lesson" that <PERSON>, one of the founders of <ORG>, a former <PERSON> minister and vice-minister of the postwar <NORP> government, spoke of recently when he explained why he fled Vietnam for freedom</ss>
<ss>"No previous regime in my country," he wrote about the concentration camps and boat people of Vietnam, "brought such numbers of people to such desperation</ss>
<ss>Not the military dictators, not the colonialists, not even the ancient <NORP> warlords</ss>
<ss>It is a lesson that my compatriots and I learned through witnessing and through suffering in our own lives the fate of our countrymen</ss>
<ss>It is a lesson that must eventually move the conscience of the world</ss>
<ss>" This man who had fought on the other side learned the value of freedom only after helping to destroy it and seeing those who had had to give it up</ss>
<ss>The task that has fallen to us as <NORP> is to move the conscience of the world, to keep alive the hope and dream of freedom</ss>
<ss>For if we fail or falter, there'll be no place for the world's oppressed to flee to</ss>
<ss>This is not a role we sought</ss>
<ss>We preach no manifest destiny</ss>
<ss>But like the <NORP> who brought a new nation into <DATE>, history has asked much of us in our time</ss>
<ss>Much we've already given; much more we must be prepared to give</ss>
<ss>This is not a task we shrink from; it's a task we welcome</ss>
<ss>For with the privilege of living in this kindly, pleasant, greening land called America, this land of generous spirit and great ideals, there is also a destiny and a duty, a duty to preserve and hold in sacred trust mankind's age-old aspirations of peace and freedom and a better life for generations to come</ss>
<ss>God bless you all, and thank you for what you're doing</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: This solemn occasion marks the <ORDINAL> time that a <PERSON> of the United <ORG>s has reported on the <ORG> of the <ORG> since <PERSON> <ORDINAL> did so in <DATE></ss>
<ss>That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new things to say about the <ORG> of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>The very key to our success has been our ability, foremost among nations, to preserve our lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us</ss>
<ss>I would like to talk with you <TIME> about what we can do together -- not as <NORP> and <NORP>, but as <NORP>-to make <DATE>'s America happy and prosperous at home, strong and respected abroad, and at peace in the world</ss>
<ss>As we gather here <TIME>, the state of our <ORG> is strong, but our economy is troubled</ss>
<ss>For too many of our fellow citizens-farmers, steel and auto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers-this is a painful period</ss>
<ss>We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end</ss>
<ss>It has fallen to us, in our time, to undo damage that was a long time in the making, and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a better future for ourselves and our children</ss>
<ss>We have a long way to go, but thanks to the courage, patience, and strength of our people, America is on the mend</ss>
<ss>But let me give you just one important reason why I believe this -- it involves many members of this body</ss>
<ss><DATE>, after <DATE> of debate and deadlock, <ORG> accomplished the seemingly impossible</ss>
<ss>Social security, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster</ss>
<ss>I, myself, have been talking about this problem for <DATE></ss>
<ss>As <DATE> began, the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim of our economic ills</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, <DATE> of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living</ss>
<ss>Then the recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wage base and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million <NORP> who depend on it</ss>
<ss>When the <PERSON> of the <ORG>, the <ORG> majority leader, and I performed the bipartisan -- or formed <ORG>, pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting interests would prevent the <ORG> from agreeing on a plan to save social security</ss>
<ss>Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are wrong</ss>
<ss>Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the <ORG> overcame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan</ss>
<ss>They proved that, when it comes to the national welfare, <NORP> can still pull together for the common good</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I'm especially pleased to join with the <PERSON> and the <ORG> majority leader in urging the <ORG> to enact this plan by <ORG></ss>
<ss>There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken together it performs a package that all of us can support</ss>
<ss>It asks for some sacrifice by all -- the self-employed, beneficiaries, workers, government employees, and the better-off among the retired -- but it imposes an undue burden on none</ss>
<ss>And, in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the <NORP> people: The integrity of the social security system will be preserved, and no one's payments will be reduced</ss>
<ss>The <ORG>'s plan will do the job; indeed, it must do the job</ss>
<ss>We owe it to <DATE>'s older <NORP> and <DATE>'s younger workers</ss>
<ss>So, before we go any further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the <ORG> who are here <TIME> and <ORG> Majority Leader <PERSON> and <PERSON> <PERSON> for a job well done</ss>
<ss>I hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face the challenges of <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE>, in this <DATE>, another <NORP> <PERSON>, <PERSON>, in his <ORDINAL> <ORG> of the <ORG> message, urged America to look to the future, to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that looks forward, not backward</ss>
<ss>"Throughout the world," he said, "change is the order of <DATE></ss>
<ss>In every nation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to  many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared</ss>
<ss>" He also reminded us that "the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in <ORG> than in politics</ss>
<ss>" So, let us, in <DATE> -- men and women of both parties, every political shade -- concentrate on the long-range, bipartisan responsibilities of government, not the short-range or short-term temptations of partisan politics</ss>
<ss>The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected; the recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted</ss>
<ss>Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted</ss>
<ss>Unemployment is far too high</ss>
<ss>Projected Federal spending -- if government refuses to tighten its own belt-will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway</ss>
<ss>This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer items and capital goods -- the stimulus we need to restart our stalled economic engines</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people have already stepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed to modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry</ss>
<ss>The inflationary expectations that led to a 21 1/2-percent interest prime rate and soaring mortgage rates <DATE> are now reduced by almost half</ss>
<ss>Leaders have started to realize that double-digit inflation is no longer a way of life</ss>
<ss>I misspoke there</ss>
<ss>I should have said "lenders</ss>
<ss>" So, interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos</ss>
<ss>The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in</ss>
<ss>Housing starts for <DATE> were up <PERCENT> from <DATE>, and housing permits, a sure indicator of future growth, were up a whopping <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>We're witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that <NORP> industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and abroad, ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the <ORG>'s work force</ss>
<ss>But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience</ss>
<ss>Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such a heavy price to cure</ss>
<ss>The permanent recovery in employment, production, and investment we seek won't come in a sharp, short spurt</ss>
<ss>It'll build carefully and steadily in <DATE></ss>
<ss>In the meantime, the challenge of government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>The federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems</ss>
<ss>Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future</ss>
<ss>Failure to cope with this problem now could mean <MONEY> more in national debt in <DATE> alone</ss>
<ss>That would average $<MONEY> in additional debt for every man, woman, child, and baby in our nation</ss>
<ss>To assure a sustained recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down</ss>
<ss>If we don't, the recovery will be too short, unemployment will remain too high, and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children</ss>
<ss>That we must not do</ss>
<ss>Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from</ss>
<ss>Contrary to the drumbeat we've been hearing for <DATE>, the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending</ss>
<ss>Taken as a percentage of the gross national product, our defense spending happens to be only about four-fifths of what it was in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Nor is the deficit, as some would have it, rooted in tax cuts</ss>
<ss>Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they were in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The fact is, our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending</ss>
<ss>During the <DATE>'s, the share of our national income devoted to this domestic spending increased by <PERCENT>, from <MONEY> out of every dollar produced by the <NORP> people to <MONEY></ss>
<ss>In spite of all our economies and efficiencies, and without adding any new programs, basic, necessary domestic spending provided for in <DATE>'s budget will grow to <MONEY> over <DATE></ss>
<ss>The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our Republic</ss>
<ss>We need a plan to overcome this danger -- a plan based on these principles</ss>
<ss>It must be bipartisan</ss>
<ss>Conquering the deficits and putting the <ORG>'s house in order will require the best effort of all of us</ss>
<ss>It must be fair</ss>
<ss>Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery, all would share fairly in the burden of transition</ss>
<ss>It must be prudent</ss>
<ss>The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy</ss>
<ss>And finally, it must be realistic</ss>
<ss>We can't rely on hope alone</ss>
<ss>With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, in my budget message, I will recommend a Federal spending freeze</ss>
<ss>I know this is strong medicine, but so far, we have only cut the rate of increase in Federal spending</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> has continued to spend more money <DATE>, though not as much more as it did in the past</ss>
<ss>Taken as a whole, the budget I'm proposing for <DATE> will increase no more than the rate of inflation</ss>
<ss>In other words, <ORG> will hold the line on real spending</ss>
<ss>Now, that's far less than many <NORP> families have had to do in these difficult times</ss>
<ss>I will request that the proposed 6-month freeze in cost-of-living adjustments recommended by the bipartisan <ORG> be applied to other government-related retirement programs</ss>
<ss>I will, also, propose a 1-<DATE> freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs, and for Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs</ss>
<ss>And let me say right here, I'm sorry, with regard to the military, in asking that of them, because for <DATE> they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing</ss>
<ss>But I'm sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair</ss>
<ss>Second, I will ask the <ORG> to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs</ss>
<ss>These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by <PERCENT> since <DATE></ss>
<ss>They are the largest single cause of the built-in or structural deficit problem</ss>
<ss>Our standard here will be fairness, ensuring that the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars go only to the truly needy; that none of them are turned away, but that fraud and waste are stamped out</ss>
<ss>And I'm sorry to say, there's a lot of it out there</ss>
<ss>In the food stamp program alone, <DATE>, we identified almost 1</ss>
<ss>1 billion in overpayments</ss>
<ss>The taxpayers aren't the only victims of this kind of abuse</ss>
<ss>The truly needy suffer as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the greedy</ss>
<ss>For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption</ss>
<ss>Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing <MONEY> in defense savings over <DATE></ss>
<ss>These are savings recommended to me by the Secretary of <ORG>, who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger America's security</ss>
<ss>We will not gamble with our national survival</ss>
<ss>And <ORDINAL>, because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over <DATE>, I will propose a standby tax, limited to <PERCENT> of the gross national product, to start in <DATE></ss>
<ss>It would last <DATE>, and it would start only if the <ORG> has <ORDINAL> approved our spending freeze and budget control program</ss>
<ss>And there are several other conditions also that must be met, all of them in order for this program to be triggered</ss>
<ss>Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a remedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely necessary</ss>
<ss>In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all <NORP></ss>
<ss>This is a goal that every <NORP> who's ever struggled with a tax form can understand</ss>
<ss>At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax reforms that we've already enacted, including the 10-percent tax break coming to taxpayers <DATE> and the tax indexing which will protect all <NORP> from inflationary bracket creep in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, I realize that this four-part plan is easier to describe than it will be to enact</ss>
<ss>But the looming deficits that hang over us and over America's future must be reduced</ss>
<ss>The path I've outlined is fair, balanced, and realistic</ss>
<ss>If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in deficits, aiming toward a balanced budget by <DATE></ss>
<ss>It's the only path that will lead to a strong, sustained recovery</ss>
<ss>Let us follow that path together</ss>
<ss>No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent jobs for all <NORP> who want to work</ss>
<ss>The recovery program will provide jobs for most, but others will need special help and training for new skills</ss>
<ss>Shortly, I will submit to the <ORG> <LAW> of <DATE>, designed to get at the special problems of the long-term unemployed, as well as young people trying to enter the job market</ss>
<ss>I'll propose extending unemployment benefits, including special incentives to employers who hire the long-term unemployed, providing programs for displaced workers, and helping federally funded and <ORG>-administered unemployment insurance programs provide workers with training and relocation assistance</ss>
<ss>Finally, our proposal will include new incentives for <DATE> youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market</ss>
<ss>We must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our unemployed</ss>
<ss>I hope we can work together on this</ss>
<ss>I hope we can work together as we did <DATE> in enacting the landmark Job Training Partnership Act</ss>
<ss>Regulatory reform legislation, a responsible clean air act, and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity</ss>
<ss>One of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade</ss>
<ss>So, I will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade -- one that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America's farmers and workers in the world marketplace</ss>
<ss>We must have adequate export financing to sell <NORP> products overseas</ss>
<ss>I will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets</ss>
<ss>We must strengthen the organization of our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow of <NORP> goods, services, and investments</ss>
<ss>Our trade position can also be improved by making our port system more efficient</ss>
<ss>Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coalfields, railroads, trucking industry, and ports</ss>
<ss>After <DATE> of debate, it's time for us to get together and enact a port modernization bill</ss>
<ss>Education, training, and retraining are fundamental to our success as are research and development and productivity</ss>
<ss>Labor, management, and government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools of growth</ss>
<ss>Tax policy, regulatory practices, and government programs all need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness</ss>
<ss>Every <NORP> has a role and a stake in international trade</ss>
<ss>We <NORP> are still the technological leaders in most fields</ss>
<ss>We must keep that edge, and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics -- starting with our educational system</ss>
<ss>While we grew complacent, others have acted</ss>
<ss>Japan, with a population only about half the size of ours, graduates from its universities more engineers than we do</ss>
<ss>If a child doesn't receive adequate math and science teaching by <DATE>, he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer</ss>
<ss>We must join together-parents, teachers, grass roots groups, organized labor, and the business community-to revitalize <NORP> education by setting a standard of excellence</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> we seek four major education goals: a quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the <ORG>s; establishment of education savings accounts that will give middle and lower-income families an incentive to save for their children's college education and, at the same time, encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth; passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools; a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer</ss>
<ss>God should never have been expelled from America's classrooms in the <ORDINAL> place</ss>
<ss>Our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic equity for women, and eliminate, once and for all, all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the United <ORG>s Code</ss>
<ss>We will not tolerate wage discrimination based on sex, and we intend to strengthen enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents, most of whom are women, do not suffer unfair financial hardship</ss>
<ss>We will also take action to remedy inequities in pensions</ss>
<ss>These initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women</ss>
<ss>Also in the area of fairness and equity, we will ask for extension of <ORG>, which is due to expire <DATE></ss>
<ss>The <ORG> is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America, and we strongly support its reauthorization</ss>
<ss>Effective enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, we'll work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all <NORP></ss>
<ss>The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking</ss>
<ss>It's high time that we make our cities safe again</ss>
<ss>This administration hereby declares an all-out war on big-time organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people</ss>
<ss>We will also implement recommendations of our <ORG> on Victims of Crime, which will report to me <DATE></ss>
<ss><NORP> agriculture, the envy of the world, has become the victim of its own successes</ss>
<ss>With one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself and 77 other people, America is confronted with record surplus crops and commodity prices below the cost of production</ss>
<ss>We must strive, through innovations like the payment-in-kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy, to restore health and vitality to rural America</ss>
<ss>Meanwhile, I have instructed <ORG> to work individually with farmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, our <ORG> on Private Sector Initiatives has successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business, labor, education, and government to address the training needs of <NORP> workers</ss>
<ss>Thanks to <ORG>, private sector initiatives are now underway in all 50 <ORG>s of the <ORG>, and thousands of working people have been helped in making the shift from dead-end jobs and low-demand skills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy</ss>
<ss>Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community child care</ss>
<ss><ORG> on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, we will also act to improve the quality of life for <NORP> by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many</ss>
<ss>And we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older <NORP></ss>
<ss>I will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to <ORG>s and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society</ss>
<ss>During <DATE>, I will send to the <ORG> a series of detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working with you on the development of these initiatives</ss>
<ss>So far, now, I've concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future</ss>
<ss>But in almost every home and workplace in America, we're already witnessing reason for great hope -- the <ORDINAL> flowering of the manmade miracles of high technology, a field pioneered and still led by our country</ss>
<ss>To many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing, cybernetics, and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when that <ORDINAL> Model T rattled down <FAC>, <ORG> But as surely as America's pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of <DATE>, the same pioneer spirit <DATE> is opening up on another vast front of opportunity, the frontier of high technology</ss>
<ss>In conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries, but we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of <DATE></ss>
<ss>This administration is committed to keeping America the technological leader of the world now and into <DATE></ss>
<ss>But let us turn briefly to the international arena</ss>
<ss>America's leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society: free elections, a free press, freedom of religious choice, free trade unions, and above all, freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state</ss>
<ss>These values are the bedrock of our strength</ss>
<ss>They unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in <ORG>, in <LOC>, in <LOC>, and elsewhere</ss>
<ss>They are also the values which in the recent past some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye</ss>
<ss>Fortunately, we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common democratic values, and we're applying them as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom</ss>
<ss>In London <DATE>, I announced the commitment of the United <ORG>s to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world</ss>
<ss>We intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously</ss>
<ss>The future belongs not to governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples, but to democratic systems of self-government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom</ss>
<ss>But our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strength -- economic strength and military strength</ss>
<ss>A strong <NORP> economy is essential to the well-being and security of our friends and allies</ss>
<ss>The restoration of a strong, healthy <NORP> economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy</ss>
<ss>The progress I've been able to report to you <TIME> will, I know, be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>We must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably linked to the world economy</ss>
<ss>We export over <PERCENT> of our industrial production, and <PERCENT> of our farmland produces for export</ss>
<ss>We will continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of <LOC> and Japan and with <ORG> to ensure it has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong, noninflationary growth</ss>
<ss>As the leader of the <LOC> and as a country that has become great and rich because of economic freedom, America must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade</ss>
<ss>As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, our strategy cannot be to follow them, but to lead the way toward freer trade</ss>
<ss>To this end, in <DATE> will host an economic summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia</ss>
<ss>As we begin <DATE>, we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of <DATE></ss>
<ss>We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails</ss>
<ss>Our Armed Forces are finally properly paid; after <DATE> of neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied</ss>
<ss>And the <NORP> uniform is once again worn with pride</ss>
<ss>Most of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway, and we will be addressing one key system, the <PRODUCT> missile, in consultation with the <ORG> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>America's foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on realism, strength, full partnership, in consultation with our allies, and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries</ss>
<ss>From <LOC> to southern <LOC> to Geneva, <NORP> diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels</ss>
<ss>We should be proud of our role as peacemakers</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> <DATE>, the United <ORG>s played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the <ORG> from Beirut</ss>
<ss><DATE>, I outlined principles to carry on the peace process begun so promisingly at <ORG></ss>
<ss>All the people of <LOC> should know that in <DATE> we will not flag in our efforts to build on that foundation to bring them the blessings of peace</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> and <LOC>, we are likewise engaged in a partnership for peace, prosperity, and democracy</ss>
<ss>Final passage of the remaining portions of our <LOC> Initiative, which passed the <ORG> <DATE>, is one of this administration's top legislative priorities for <DATE></ss>
<ss>The security and economic assistance policies of this administration in <LOC> and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race</ss>
<ss>This undertaking is a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches, and I'm counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the <ORG> to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal</ss>
<ss>At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the <NORP> <ORG></ss>
<ss><DATE> saw a change in <NORP> leadership</ss>
<ss>We're prepared for a positive change in <NORP> relations</ss>
<ss>But the <NORP> <ORG> must show by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rights and sovereignty of the family of nations</ss>
<ss>Responsible members of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbors</ss>
<ss>And they restrain their allies from aggression</ss>
<ss>For our part, we're vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the <NORP> <ORG></ss>
<ss>Supported by our allies, we've put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels</ss>
<ss>We insist on an equal balance of forces</ss>
<ss>And given the overwhelming evidence of <NORP> violations of international treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons, we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable</ss>
<ss>In the case of intermediate-range nuclear forces, we have proposed the complete elimination of the entire class of land-based missiles</ss>
<ss>We're also prepared to carefully explore serious <NORP> proposals</ss>
<ss>At the same time, let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions</ss>
<ss>With firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate</ss>
<ss>Deep down, the <NORP> must know it's in their interest as well as ours to prevent a wasteful arms race</ss>
<ss>And once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence, they will have every reason to join us in the search for greater security and major arms reductions</ss>
<ss>When that moment comes -- and I'm confident that it will -- we will have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world's people</ss>
<ss>A very wise man, <PERSON>, once said that America has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path</ss>
<ss>Our country is a special place, because we <NORP> have always been sustained, through good times and bad, by a noble vision -- a vision not only of what the world around us is <DATE> but what we as a free people can make it be <DATE></ss>
<ss>We're realists; we solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us</ss>
<ss>But we're also idealists, for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world</ss>
<ss>Right now we need both realism and idealism</ss>
<ss>Millions of our neighbors are without work</ss>
<ss>It is up to us to see they aren't without hope</ss>
<ss>This is a task for all of us</ss>
<ss>And may I say, <NORP> have rallied to this cause, proving once again that we are the most generous people on <LOC></ss>
<ss>We who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy</ss>
<ss>And here all that time, I thought you were reading the paper</ss>
<ss>The single thing -- the single thing that can start the wheels of industry turning again is further reduction of interest rates</ss>
<ss>Just another 1 or 2 points can mean tens of thousands of jobs</ss>
<ss>Right now, with inflation as low as it is, <PERCENT>, there is room for interest rates to come down</ss>
<ss>Only fear prevents their reduction</ss>
<ss>A lender, as we know, must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollars loaned</ss>
<ss>And that depreciation is, of course, the amount of inflation</ss>
<ss><DATE>, interest rates are based on fear -- fear that government will resort to measures, as it has in the past, that will send inflation zooming again</ss>
<ss>We who serve here in this <ORG> must erase that fear by making it absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation; that, together, we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth</ss>
<ss>Yes, the problems confronting us are large and forbidding</ss>
<ss>And, certainly, no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment</ss>
<ss>But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful</ss>
<ss>Back over <DATE>, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened; sometimes when its very existence was at stake</ss>
<ss>Always with courage and common sense, they met the crises of their time and lived to see a stronger, better, and more prosperous country</ss>
<ss>The present situation is no worse and, in fact, is not as bad as some of those they faced</ss>
<ss>Time and again, they proved that there is nothing we <NORP> cannot achieve as free men and women</ss>
<ss>Yes, we still have problems -- plenty of them</ss>
<ss>But it's just plain wrong -- unjust to our country and unjust to our people -- to let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all: America is on the mend</ss>
<ss>We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can</ss>
<ss>No one can quarrel with that</ss>
<ss>We must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis</ss>
<ss>But the big story about America <DATE> is the way that millions of confident, caring people-those extraordinary "ordinary" <NORP> who never make the headlines and will never be interviewed -- are laying the foundation, not just for recovery from our present problems but for a better <DATE> for all our people</ss>
<ss>From coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories, at new construction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors are helping neighbors</ss>
<ss>And they've already begun the building, the research, the work, and the giving that will make our country great again</ss>
<ss>I believe this, because I believe in them-in the strength of their hearts and minds, in the commitment that each one of them brings to their <DATE> lives, be they high or humble</ss>
<ss>The challenge for us in government is to be worthy of them -- to make government a help, not a hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising <DATE> ahead</ss>
<ss>If we do that, if we care what our children and our children's children will say of us, if we want them <DATE> to be thankful for what we did here in these temples of freedom, we will work together to make America better for our having been here-not just in <DATE> or <DATE> but in <DATE> and beyond</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and God bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Reverend clergy all, Senator <PERSON>, distinguished members of the Florida congressional delegation, and all of you: I can't tell you how you have warmed my heart with your welcome</ss>
<ss>I'm delighted to be here <DATE></ss>
<ss>Those of you in <ORG> are known for your spiritual and humanitarian work</ss>
<ss>And I would be especially remiss if I didn't discharge right now one personal debt of gratitude</ss>
<ss>Thank you for your prayers</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I have felt their presence many times in many ways</ss>
<ss>And believe me, for us they've made all the difference</ss>
<ss>The other day in <LOC> of <FAC> at a meeting there, someone asked me whether I was aware of all the people out there who were praying for the President</ss>
<ss>And I had to say, "Yes, I am</ss>
<ss>I've felt it</ss>
<ss>I believe in intercessionary prayer</ss>
<ss>" But I couldn't help but say to that questioner after he'd asked the question that -- or at least say to them that if sometime when he was praying he got a busy signal, it was just me in there ahead of him</ss>
<ss>I think I understand how <PERSON> felt when he said, "I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go</ss>
<ss>" From the joy and the good feeling of this conference, I go to a political reception</ss>
<ss>Now, I don't know why, but that bit of scheduling reminds me of a story --  -- which I'll share with you</ss>
<ss>An evangelical minister and a politician arrived at Heaven's gate <DATE> together</ss>
<ss>And <PERSON>, after doing all the necessary formalities, took them in hand to show them where their quarters would be</ss>
<ss>And he took them to a small, single room with a bed, a chair, and a table and said this was for the clergyman</ss>
<ss>And the politician was a little worried about what might be in store for him</ss>
<ss>And he couldn't believe it then when <PERSON> stopped in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely grounds, many servants, and told him that these would be his quarters</ss>
<ss>And he couldn't help but ask, he said, "But wait, how -- there's something wrong -- how do I get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room?" And <PERSON> said, "You have to understand how things are up here</ss>
<ss>We've got thousands and thousands of clergy</ss>
<ss>You're the <ORDINAL> politician who ever made it</ss>
<ss>"  But I don't want to contribute to a stereotype</ss>
<ss>So, I tell you there are a great many <PERSON>-fearing, dedicated, noble men and women in public life, present company included</ss>
<ss>And, yes, we need your help to keep us ever mindful of the ideas and the principles that brought us into the public arena in the <ORDINAL> place</ss>
<ss>The basis of those ideals and principles is a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that, itself, is grounded in the much deeper realization that freedom prospers only where the blessings of <PERSON> are avidly sought and humbly accepted</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> experiment in democracy rests on this insight</ss>
<ss>Its discovery was the great triumph of our <ORG>, voiced by <PERSON> when he said: "If we will not be governed by <PERSON>, we must be governed by tyrants</ss>
<ss>" Explaining the inalienable rights of men, <PERSON> said, "The <PERSON> who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time</ss>
<ss>" And it was <PERSON> who said that "of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports</ss>
<ss>" And finally, that shrewdest of all observers of <NORP> democracy, <PERSON>, put it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of America's greatness and genius -- and he said: "Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the greatness and the genius of America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>America is good</ss>
<ss>And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great</ss>
<ss>" Well, I'm pleased to be here <DATE> with you who are keeping America great by keeping her good</ss>
<ss>Only through your work and prayers and those of millions of others can we hope to survive <DATE> and keep alive this experiment in liberty, this last, best hope of man</ss>
<ss>I want you to know that this administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of America in you, her people, and in your families, churches, neighborhoods, communities -- the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Now, I don't have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to, or at least out of step with, a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern-day secularism, discarding the tried and time-tested values upon which our very civilization is based</ss>
<ss>No matter how well intentioned, their value system is radically different from that of most <NORP></ss>
<ss>And while they proclaim that they're freeing us from superstitions of the past, they've taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation</ss>
<ss>Sometimes their voices are louder than ours, but they are not yet a majority</ss>
<ss>An example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in Washington</ss>
<ss>And since I'm involved, I've been waiting to hear from the parents of young America</ss>
<ss>How far are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents? Let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can</ss>
<ss>An organization of citizens, sincerely motivated and deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent, sometime ago established a nationwide network of clinics to offer help to these girls and, hopefully, alleviate this situation</ss>
<ss>Now, again, let me say, I do not fault their intent</ss>
<ss>However, in their well-intentioned effort, these clinics have decided to provide advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their parents</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> now, the federal government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics</ss>
<ss>In providing for this, the <ORG> decreed that every effort would be made to maximize parental participation</ss>
<ss>Nevertheless, the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting parental consent or giving notification after they've done so</ss>
<ss>Girls termed "sexually active" -- and that has replaced the word "promiscuous" -- are given this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion</ss>
<ss>Well, we have ordered clinics receiving federal funds to notify the parents such help has been given</ss>
<ss>One of the nation's leading newspapers has created the term "squeal rule" in editorializing against us for doing this, and we're being criticized for violating the privacy of young people</ss>
<ss>A judge has recently granted an injunction against an enforcement of our rule</ss>
<ss>I've watched TV panel shows discuss this issue, seen columnists pontificating on our error, but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex</ss>
<ss>Is all of <NORP> tradition wrong? Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm? And isn't it the parents' right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives? Many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government</ss>
<ss>We're going to fight in the courts</ss>
<ss>The right of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washington-based bureaucrats and social engineers</ss>
<ss>But the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of <NORP> democracy</ss>
<ss>Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under <PERSON> is acknowledged</ss>
<ss>When our <ORG> passed the <ORDINAL> amendment, they sought to protect churches from government interference</ss>
<ss>They never intended to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself</ss>
<ss>The evidence of this permeates our history and our government</ss>
<ss>The Declaration of Independence mentions <FAC> no less than four times</ss>
<ss>"In <WORK_OF_ART>" is engraved on our coinage</ss>
<ss><ORG> opens its proceedings with a religious invocation</ss>
<ss>And the members of <ORG> open their sessions with a prayer</ss>
<ss>I just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as <ORG> Justices and <ORG>men</ss>
<ss><DATE>, I sent the <ORG> a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools</ss>
<ss>Already this session, there's growing bipartisan support for the amendment, and I am calling on the <ORG> to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray</ss>
<ss>Perhaps some of you read recently about the Lubbock school case, where a judge actually ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student groups, even when the group meetings were being held during the students' own time</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech</ss>
<ss>Senators <PERSON> and <PERSON> have proposed legislation in the <ORG> on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech</ss>
<ss>Such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students</ss>
<ss>And I hope the <ORG> considers these bills quickly</ss>
<ss>And with your help, I think it's possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE>, a <ORG> decision literally wiped off the books of 50 states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children</ss>
<ss>Abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children <DATE></ss>
<ss>Human life legislation ending this tragedy will <DATE> pass the <ORG>, and you and I must never rest until it does</ss>
<ss>Unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity, then its right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must be protected</ss>
<ss>You may remember that when abortion on demand began, many, and, indeed, I'm sure many of you, warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life, that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life -- infanticide or mercy killing</ss>
<ss>Tragically enough, those warnings proved all too true</ss>
<ss><DATE> a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant</ss>
<ss>I have directed <ORG> to make clear to every health care facility in the United States that <LAW> of <DATE> protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps, including infants</ss>
<ss>And we have taken the further step of requiring that each and every recipient of federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that "discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by federal law</ss>
<ss>" It also lists a 24-hour, toll-free number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infant's life</ss>
<ss>In addition, recent legislation introduced in the <ORG> by Representative <PERSON> of Illinois not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions, it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide</ss>
<ss>I urge the <ORG> to begin hearings and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children, including the disabled or handicapped</ss>
<ss>Now, I'm sure that you must get discouraged at times, but you've done better than you know, perhaps</ss>
<ss>There's a great spiritual awakening in America, a renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of America's goodness and greatness</ss>
<ss>One recent survey by a Washington-based research council concluded that <NORP> were far more religious than the people of other nations; <PERCENT> of those surveyed expressed a belief in <PERSON> and a huge majority believed the Ten Commandments had real meaning in their lives</ss>
<ss>And another study has found that an overwhelming majority of <NORP> disapprove of adultery, teenage sex, pornography, abortion, and hard drugs</ss>
<ss>And this same study showed a deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief</ss>
<ss>I think the items that we've discussed here <DATE> must be a key part of the nation's political agenda</ss>
<ss>For the <ORDINAL> time the <ORG> is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the prayer and abortion issues -- and that's enormous progress right there</ss>
<ss>I repeat: America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal</ss>
<ss>And with your biblical keynote, I say <DATE>, "Yes, let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream</ss>
<ss>" Now, obviously, much of this new political and social consensus I've talked about is based on a positive view of <NORP> history, one that takes pride in our country's accomplishments and record</ss>
<ss>But we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man</ss>
<ss>We know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the phenomenology of evil or, as theologians would put it, the doctrine of sin</ss>
<ss>There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by <ORG> and <WORK_OF_ART> to oppose it with all our might</ss>
<ss>Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal</ss>
<ss>The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past</ss>
<ss>For example, the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights, once a source of disunity and civil war, is now a point of pride for all <NORP></ss>
<ss>We must never go back</ss>
<ss>There is no room for racism, anti-Semitism, or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country</ss>
<ss>I know that you've been horrified, as have I, by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice</ss>
<ss>Use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst</ss>
<ss>The commandment given us is clear and simple: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</ss>
<ss>" But whatever sad episodes exist in our past, any objective observer must hold a positive view of <NORP> history, a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into reality</ss>
<ss>Especially in <DATE>, America has kept alight the torch of freedom, but not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world</ss>
<ss>And this brings me to my final point <DATE></ss>
<ss>During my <ORDINAL> press conference as President, in answer to a direct question, I pointed out that, as good <NORP>-Leninists, the <NORP> leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause, which is world revolution</ss>
<ss>I think I should point out I was only quoting Lenin, their guiding spirit, who said in <DATE> that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas -- that's their name for religion -- or ideas that are outside class conceptions</ss>
<ss>Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war</ss>
<ss>And everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old, exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat</ss>
<ss>Well, I think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of <NORP> doctrine illustrates an historical reluctance to see <NORP> powers for what they are</ss>
<ss>We saw this phenomenon in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We see it too often <DATE></ss>
<ss>This doesn't mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them</ss>
<ss>I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent, to remind them that it was the <LOC> that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the forties and fifties for territorial gain and which now proposes 50-percent cut in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>At the same time, however, they must be made to understand we will never compromise our principles and standards</ss>
<ss>We will never give away our freedom</ss>
<ss>We will never abandon our belief in <PERSON></ss>
<ss>And we will never stop searching for a genuine peace</ss>
<ss>But we can assure none of these things America stands for through the so-called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by some</ss>
<ss>The truth is that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud, for that is merely the illusion of peace</ss>
<ss>The reality is that we must find peace through strength</ss>
<ss>I would agree to a freeze if only we could freeze the <NORP>' global desires</ss>
<ss>A freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the <NORP> to negotiate seriously in Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed</ss>
<ss>Instead, they would achieve their objectives through the freeze</ss>
<ss>A freeze would reward the <NORP> Union for its enormous and unparalleled military buildup</ss>
<ss>It would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of United States and allied defenses and would leave our aging forces increasingly vulnerable</ss>
<ss>And an honest freeze would require extensive prior negotiations on the systems and numbers to be limited and on the measures to ensure effective verification and compliance</ss>
<ss>And the kind of a freeze that has been suggested would be virtually impossible to verify</ss>
<ss>Such a major effort would divert us completely from our current negotiations on achieving substantial reductions</ss>
<ss><DATE>, I heard a young father, a very prominent young man in the entertainment world, addressing a tremendous gathering in California</ss>
<ss>It was during the time of <EVENT>, and communism and our own way of life were very much on people's minds</ss>
<ss>And he was speaking to that subject</ss>
<ss>And suddenly, though, I heard him saying, "I love my little girls more than anything -- -- " And I said to myself, "Oh, no, don't</ss>
<ss>You can't -- don't say that</ss>
<ss>" But I had underestimated him</ss>
<ss>He went on: "I would rather see my little girls die now, still believing in <PERSON>, than have them grow up under communism and <DATE> die no longer believing in <PERSON></ss>
<ss>" There were thousands of young people in that audience</ss>
<ss>They came to their feet with shouts of joy</ss>
<ss>They had instantly recognized the profound truth in what he had said, with regard to the physical and the soul and what was truly important</ss>
<ss>Yes, let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that <NORP> darkness -- pray they will discover the joy of knowing <PERSON></ss>
<ss>But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the <LOC>, they are the focus of evil in the modern world</ss>
<ss>It was <PERSON> who, in his unforgettable "<WORK_OF_ART>," wrote: "The greatest evil is not done now in those sordid 'dens of crime' that <PERSON> loved to paint</ss>
<ss>It is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps</ss>
<ss>In those we see its final result</ss>
<ss>But it is conceived and ordered  in clear, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice</ss>
<ss>" Well, because these "quiet men" do not "raise their voices," because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace, because, like other dictators before them, they're always making "their final territorial demand," some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses</ss>
<ss>But if history teaches anything, it teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly</ss>
<ss>It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom</ss>
<ss>So, I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority</ss>
<ss>You know, I've always believed that old Screwtape reserved his best efforts for those of you in the church</ss>
<ss>So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride -- the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil</ss>
<ss>I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our efforts, this administration's efforts, to keep America strong and free, while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear arsenals and <DATE>, with <PERSON>'s help, their total elimination</ss>
<ss>While America's military strength is important, let me add here that I've always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets, by armies or military might</ss>
<ss>The real crisis we face <DATE> is a spiritual one; at root, it is a test of moral will and faith</ss>
<ss><ORG>, the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of the terrible traumas of our time, the <ORG> case, wrote that the crisis of the <LOC>ern World exists to the degree in which the <LOC> is indifferent to <PERSON>, the degree to which it collaborates in communism's attempt to make man stand alone without <PERSON></ss>
<ss>And then he said, for <ORG> is actually the <ORDINAL> oldest faith, <ORDINAL> proclaimed in <LOC> with the words of temptation, "Ye shall be as gods</ss>
<ss>" <WORK_OF_ART> can answer this challenge, he wrote, "but only provided that its faith in <PERSON> and the freedom He enjoins is as great as communism's faith in Man</ss>
<ss>" I believe we shall rise to the challenge</ss>
<ss>I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written</ss>
<ss>I believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual</ss>
<ss>And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man</ss>
<ss>For in the words of <PERSON>: "He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increased strength</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>" Yes, change your world</ss>
<ss>One of our <ORG>, <PERSON>, said, "We have it within our power to begin the world over again</ss>
<ss>" We can do it, doing together what no one church could do by itself</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and thank you very much</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>, thank you for sharing your time with me <TIME></ss>
<ss>The subject I want to discuss with you, peace and national security, is both timely and important</ss>
<ss>Timely, because I've reached a decision which offers a new hope for our children in <DATE>, a decision I'll tell you about in <TIME></ss>
<ss>And important because there's a very big decision that you must make for yourselves</ss>
<ss>This subject involves the most basic duty that any President and any people share, the duty to protect and strengthen the peace</ss>
<ss>At <DATE>, I submitted to the <ORG> a defense budget which reflects my best judgment of the best understanding of the experts and specialists who advise me about what we and our allies must do to protect our people in <DATE></ss>
<ss>That budget is much more than a long list of numbers, for behind all the numbers lies America's ability to prevent the greatest of human tragedies and preserve our free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world</ss>
<ss>It is part of a careful, long-term plan to make America strong again after too many <DATE> of neglect and mistakes</ss>
<ss>Our efforts to rebuild America's defenses and strengthen the peace began <DATE> when we requested a major increase in the defense program</ss>
<ss>Since then, the amount of those increases we <ORDINAL> proposed has been reduced by half, through improvements in management and procurement and other savings</ss>
<ss>The budget request that is now before the <ORG> has been trimmed to the limits of safety</ss>
<ss>Further deep cuts cannot be made without seriously endangering the security of the Nation</ss>
<ss>The choice is up to the men and women you've elected to the <ORG>, and that means the choice is up to you</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I want to explain to you what this defense debate is all about and why I'm convinced that the budget now before the <ORG> is necessary, responsible, and deserving of your support</ss>
<ss>And I want to offer hope for the future</ss>
<ss>But <ORDINAL>, let me say what the defense debate is not about</ss>
<ss>It is not about spending arithmetic</ss>
<ss>I know that in <DATE> you've been bombarded with numbers and percentages</ss>
<ss>Some say we need only a 5-percent increase in defense spending</ss>
<ss>The so-called alternate budget backed by liberals in <ORG> would lower the figure to <PERCENT>, cutting our defense spending by <MONEY> over <DATE></ss>
<ss>The trouble with all these numbers is that they tell us little about the kind of defense program America needs or the benefits and security and freedom that our defense effort buys for us</ss>
<ss>What seems to have been lost in all this debate is the simple truth of how a defense budget is arrived at</ss>
<ss>It isn't done by deciding to spend a certain number of dollars</ss>
<ss>Those loud voices that are occasionally heard charging that the Government is trying to solve a security problem by throwing money at it are nothing more than noise based on ignorance</ss>
<ss>We start by considering what must be done to maintain peace and review all the possible threats against our security</ss>
<ss>Then a strategy for strengthening peace and defending against those threats must be agreed upon</ss>
<ss>And, finally, our defense establishment must be evaluated to see what is necessary to protect against any or all of the potential threats</ss>
<ss>The cost of achieving these ends is totaled up, and the result is the budget for national defense</ss>
<ss>There is no logical way that you can say, let's spend <MONEY> less</ss>
<ss>You can only say, which part of our defense measures do we believe we can do without and still have security against all contingencies? Anyone in the <ORG> who advocates a percentage or a specific dollar cut in defense spending should be made to say what part of our defenses he would eliminate, and he should be candid enough to acknowledge that his cuts mean cutting our commitments to allies or inviting greater risk or both</ss>
<ss>The defense policy of the United States is based on a simple premise: The United States does not start fights</ss>
<ss>We will never be an aggressor</ss>
<ss>We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression-to preserve freedom and peace</ss>
<ss>Since the dawn of the atomic age, we've sought to reduce the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by seeking genuine arms control</ss>
<ss>"Deterrence" means simply this: making sure any adversary who thinks about attacking the United States, or our allies, or our vital interests, concludes that the risks to him outweigh any potential gains</ss>
<ss>Once he understands that, he won't attack</ss>
<ss>We maintain the peace through our strength; weakness only invites aggression</ss>
<ss>This strategy of deterrence has not changed</ss>
<ss>It still works</ss>
<ss>But what it takes to maintain deterrence has changed</ss>
<ss>It took one kind of military force to deter an attack when we had far more nuclear weapons than any other power; it takes another kind now that the <NORP>, for example, have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapons to destroy virtually all of our missiles on the ground</ss>
<ss>Now, this is not to say that the <NORP> Union is planning to make war on us</ss>
<ss>Nor do I believe a war is inevitable -- quite the contrary</ss>
<ss>But what must be recognized is that our security is based on being prepared to meet all threats</ss>
<ss>There was a time when we depended on coastal forts and artillery batteries, because, with the weaponry of <DATE>, any attack would have had to come by sea</ss>
<ss>Well, this is a different world, and our defenses must be based on recognition and awareness of the weaponry possessed by other nations in the nuclear age</ss>
<ss>We can't afford to believe that we will never be threatened</ss>
<ss>There have been two world wars in my lifetime</ss>
<ss>We didn't start them and, indeed, did everything we could to avoid being drawn into them</ss>
<ss>But we were ill-prepared for both</ss>
<ss>Had we been better prepared, peace might have been preserved</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> the <NORP> Union has been accumulating enormous military might</ss>
<ss>They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability</ss>
<ss>And they haven't stopped now</ss>
<ss>During <DATE>, the <NORP> have built up a massive arsenal of new strategic nuclear weapons -- weapons that can strike directly at the United States</ss>
<ss>As an example, the United States introduced its last new intercontinental ballistic missile, <PERSON>, in <DATE>, and we're now dismantling our even older Titan missiles</ss>
<ss>But what has the <NORP> Union done in <DATE>? Well, since <DATE> the <NORP> Union has built five new classes of <ORG>'s, and upgraded these eight times</ss>
<ss>As a result, their missiles are much more powerful and accurate than they were <DATE>, and they continue to develop more, while ours are increasingly obsolete</ss>
<ss>The same thing has happened in other areas</ss>
<ss>Over the same period, the <NORP> Union built 4 new classes of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and over 60 new missile sub<NORP></ss>
<ss>We built 2 new types of submarine missiles and actually withdrew 10 sub<NORP> from strategic missions</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union built over 200 new <ORG> bombers, and their brand new <PERSON> bomber is now under development</ss>
<ss>We haven't built a new long-range bomber since our B-52's were deployed about a quarter of a century ago, and we've already retired several hundred of those because of old age</ss>
<ss>Indeed, despite what many people think, our strategic forces only cost <PERCENT> of the defense budget</ss>
<ss>Another example of what's happened: In <DATE> the <NORP> had 600 intermediate-range nuclear missiles based on land and were beginning to add the <ORG>-20 -- a new, highly accurate, mobile missile with 3 warheads</ss>
<ss>We had none</ss>
<ss>Since then the <NORP> have strengthened their lead</ss>
<ss>By <DATE>, when <NORP> leader <PERSON> declared "a balance now exists," the <NORP> had over 800 warheads</ss>
<ss>We still had none</ss>
<ss><DATE>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> pledged a moratorium, or freeze, on <ORG>-20 deployment</ss>
<ss>But by <DATE>, their 800 warheads had become more than 1,200</ss>
<ss>We still had none</ss>
<ss>Some freeze</ss>
<ss>At this time <NORP> Defense Minister <PERSON> announced "approximate parity of forces continues to exist</ss>
<ss>" But the <NORP> are still adding an average of 3 new warheads <DATE>, and now have 1,300</ss>
<ss>These warheads can reach their targets in a matter of <TIME></ss>
<ss>We still have none</ss>
<ss>So far, it seems that the <NORP> definition of parity is a box score of 1,300 to nothing, in their favor</ss>
<ss>So, together with our <ORG> allies, we decided in <DATE> to deploy new weapons, beginning <DATE>, as a deterrent to their <ORG> -- 20's and as an incentive to the <NORP> Union to meet us in serious arms control negotiations</ss>
<ss>We will begin that deployment <DATE></ss>
<ss>At the same time, however, we're willing to cancel our program if the <NORP> will dismantle theirs</ss>
<ss>This is what we've called a zero-zero plan</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> are now at the negotiating table -- and I think it's fair to say that without our planned deployments, they wouldn't be there</ss>
<ss>Now, let's consider conventional forces</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE> the United States has produced 3,050 tactical combat aircraft</ss>
<ss>By contrast, the <NORP> Union has produced twice as many</ss>
<ss>When we look at attack sub<NORP>, the United States has produced 27 while the <NORP> Union has produced 61</ss>
<ss>For armored vehicles, including tanks, we have produced 11,200</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union has produced 54,000 -- nearly 5 to 1 in their favor</ss>
<ss>Finally, with artillery, we've produced 950 artillery and rocket launchers while the <NORP> have produced more than 13,000 -- a staggering 14-to-1 ratio</ss>
<ss>There was a time when we were able to offset superior <NORP> numbers with higher quality, but <DATE> they are building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own</ss>
<ss>As the <NORP> have increased their military power, they've been emboldened to extend that power</ss>
<ss>They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies</ss>
<ss>The following aerial photographs, most of them secret until now, illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home: <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>They're not dramatic photographs</ss>
<ss>But I think they help give you a better understanding of what I'm talking about</ss>
<ss>This <NORP> intelligence collection facility, less than a hundred miles from our coast, is the largest of its kind in the world</ss>
<ss>The acres and acres of antennae fields and intelligence monitors are targeted on key <PERSON> military installations and sensitive activities</ss>
<ss>The installation in Lourdes, Cuba, is manned by 1,500 <NORP> technicians</ss>
<ss>And the satellite ground station allows instant communications with Moscow</ss>
<ss>This 28-square-mile facility has grown by <PERCENT> in size and capability during <DATE></ss>
<ss>In western Cuba, we see this military airfield and it complement of modern, <NORP>-built Mig-23 aircraft</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union uses this <NORP> airfield for its own long-range reconnaissance missions</ss>
<ss>And <DATE>, two modern <NORP> antisubmarine warfare aircraft began operating from it</ss>
<ss>During <DATE>, the level of <NORP> arms exports to Cuba can only be compared to the levels reached during the <NORP> missile crisis <DATE></ss>
<ss>This <ORDINAL> photo, which is the only one in this series that has been previously made public, shows <NORP> military hardware that has made its way to <LOC></ss>
<ss>This airfield with its MI-8 helicopters, anti-aircraft guns, and protected fighter sites is one of a number of military facilities in Nicaragua which has received <NORP> equipment funneled through Cuba, and reflects the massive military buildup going on in that country</ss>
<ss>On the small island of <PERSON>, at the southern end of the <LOC> chain, the <NORP>, with <NORP> financing and backing, are in the process of building an airfield with a 10,000-foot runway</ss>
<ss><PERSON> doesn't even have an air force</ss>
<ss>Who is it intended for? The <LOC> is a very important passageway for our international commerce and military lines of communication</ss>
<ss>More than half of all <NORP> oil imports now pass through the <LOC></ss>
<ss>The rapid buildup of <PERSON>'s military potential is unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under 110,000 people and totally at odds with the pattern of other eastern <LOC>, most of which are unarmed</ss>
<ss>The <NORP>-<NORP> militarization of <PERSON>, in short, can only be seen as power projection into the region</ss>
<ss>And it is in this important economic and strategic area that we're trying to help the Governments of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, and others in their struggles for democracy against guerrillas supported through Cuba and Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>These pictures only tell a small part of the story</ss>
<ss>I wish I could show you more without compromising our most sensitive intelligence sources and methods</ss>
<ss>But the <NORP> Union is also supporting <NORP> military forces in Angola and Ethiopia</ss>
<ss>They have bases in Ethiopia and South Yemen, near <LOC> oil fields</ss>
<ss>They've taken over the port that we built at <FAC> in Vietnam</ss>
<ss>And now for the <ORDINAL> time in history, <ORG> is a force to be reckoned with in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Some people may still ask: Would the <NORP> ever use their formidable military power? Well, again, can we afford to believe they won't? There is Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>And in Poland, the <NORP> denied the will of the people and in so doing demonstrated to the world how their military power could also be used to intimidate</ss>
<ss>The final fact is that the <NORP> Union is acquiring what can only be considered an offensive military force</ss>
<ss>They have continued to build far more intercontinental ballistic missiles than they could possibly need simply to deter an attack</ss>
<ss>Their conventional forces are trained and equipped not so much to defend against an attack as they are to permit sudden, surprise offensives of their own</ss>
<ss>Our <ORG> allies have assumed a great defense burden, including the military draft in most countries</ss>
<ss>We're working with them and our other friends around the world to do more</ss>
<ss>Our defensive strategy means we need military forces that can move very quickly, forces that are trained and ready to respond to any emergency</ss>
<ss>Every item in our defense program -- our ships, our tanks, our planes, our funds for training and spare parts -- is intended for one all-important purpose: to keep the peace</ss>
<ss>Unfortunately, <DATE> of neglecting our military forces had called into question our ability to do that</ss>
<ss>When I took office in <DATE>, I was appalled by what I found: <NORP> planes that couldn't fly and <NORP> ships that couldn't sail for lack of spare parts and trained personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training</ss>
<ss>The inevitable result of all this was poor morale in our <ORG>, difficulty in recruiting the brightest young <NORP> to wear the uniform, and difficulty in convincing our most experienced military personnel to stay on</ss>
<ss>There was a real question then about how well we could meet a crisis</ss>
<ss>And it was obvious that we had to begin a major modernization program to ensure we could deter aggression and preserve the peace in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We had to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and staying power of our conventional forces, so they could meet -- and therefore help deter -- a crisis</ss>
<ss>We had to make up for <DATE> of investment by moving forward with a long-term plan to prepare our forces to counter the military capabilities our adversaries were developing for the future</ss>
<ss>I know that all of you want peace, and so do <ORG> I know too that many of you seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace</ss>
<ss>But a freeze now would make us less, not more, secure and would raise, not reduce, the risks of war</ss>
<ss>It would be largely unverifiable and would seriously undercut our negotiations on arms reduction</ss>
<ss>It would reward the <NORP> for their massive military buildup while preventing us from modernizing our aging and increasingly vulnerable forces</ss>
<ss>With their present margin of superiority, why should they agree to arms reductions knowing that we were prohibited from catching up? Believe me, it wasn't pleasant for someone who had come to Washington determined to reduce government spending, but we had to move forward with the task of repairing our defenses or we would lose our ability to deter conflict now and in the future</ss>
<ss>We had to demonstrate to any adversary that aggression could not succeed, and that the only real solution was substantial, equitable, and effectively verifiable arms reduction -- the kind we're working for right now in Geneva</ss>
<ss>Thanks to your strong support, and bipartisan support from the <ORG>, we began to turn things around</ss>
<ss>Already, we're seeing some very encouraging results</ss>
<ss>Quality recruitment and retention are up dramatically-more high school graduates are choosing military careers, and more experienced career personnel are choosing to stay</ss>
<ss>Our men and women in uniform at last are getting the tools and training they need to do their jobs</ss>
<ss>Ask around <DATE>, especially among our young people, and I think you will find a whole new attitude toward serving their country</ss>
<ss>This reflects more than just better pay, equipment, and leadership</ss>
<ss>You the <NORP> people have sent a signal to these young people that it is once again an honor to wear the uniform</ss>
<ss>That's not something you measure in a budget, but it's a very real part of our nation's strength</ss>
<ss>It'll take us longer to build the kind of equipment we need to keep peace in the future, but we've made a good start</ss>
<ss>We haven't built a new long-range bomber for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now we're building the B-1</ss>
<ss>We hadn't launched one new strategic submarine for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now we're building one <PRODUCT> submarine <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our land-based missiles are increasingly threatened by the many huge, new <NORP> <ORG>'s</ss>
<ss>We're determining how to solve that problem</ss>
<ss>At the same time, we're working in the <ORG> and <ORG> negotiations with the goal of achieving deep reductions in the strategic and intermediate nuclear arsenals of both sides</ss>
<ss>We have also begun the long-needed modernization of our conventional forces</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> is getting its <ORDINAL> new tank in <DATE></ss>
<ss><ORG> is modernizing</ss>
<ss>We're rebuilding our <ORG>, which shrank from about a thousand ships in the late <DATE>'s to 453 during the <DATE>'s</ss>
<ss>Our nation needs a superior <ORG> to support our military forces and vital interests overseas</ss>
<ss>We're now on the road to achieving a 600-ship <ORG> and increasing the amphibious capabilities of our <NORP>, who are now serving the cause of peace in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>And we're building a real capability to assist our friends in the vitally important <LOC> and <LOC> region</ss>
<ss>This adds up to a major effort, and it isn't cheap</ss>
<ss>It comes at a time when there are many other pressures on our budget and when the <NORP> people have already had to make major sacrifices during the recession</ss>
<ss>But we must not be misled by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>The fact is that in <DATE> we have seen a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayer's dollar</ss>
<ss>Back in <DATE>, payments to individuals took up <PERCENT> of the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, these payments steadily increased and, <DATE>, will account for <PERCENT> of the budget</ss>
<ss>By contrast, in <DATE> defense took up more than half of the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>By <DATE> this spending had fallen to a low of <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Even with the increase that I am requesting <DATE>, defense will still amount to <PERCENT> of the budget</ss>
<ss>The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice, simple arithmetic</ss>
<ss>They're the same kind of talk that led the democracies to neglect their defenses in the <DATE>'s and invited the tragedy of <EVENT></ss>
<ss>We must not let that grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or neglect</ss>
<ss>This is why I'm speaking to you <TIME>-to urge you to tell your Senators and <ORG>men that you know we must continue to restore our military strength</ss>
<ss>If we stop in midstream, we will send a signal of decline, of lessened will, to friends and adversaries alike</ss>
<ss>Free people must voluntarily, through open debate and democratic means, meet the challenge that <NORP> pose by compulsion</ss>
<ss>It's up to us, in our time, to choose and choose wisely between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day</ss>
<ss>The solution is well within our grasp</ss>
<ss>But to reach it, there is simply no alternative but to continue <DATE>, in this budget, to provide the resources we need to preserve the peace and guarantee our freedom</ss>
<ss>Now, thus far <TIME> I've shared with you my thoughts on the problems of national security we must face together</ss>
<ss>My predecessors in <FAC> have appeared before you on other occasions to describe the threat posed by <NORP> power and have proposed steps to address that threat</ss>
<ss>But since the advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation</ss>
<ss>This approach to stability through offensive threat has worked</ss>
<ss>We and our allies have succeeded in preventing nuclear war for <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, however, my advisers, including in particular <ORG>, have underscored the necessity to break out of a future that relies solely on offensive retaliation for our security</ss>
<ss>Over the course of these discussions, I've become more and more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings by threatening their existence</ss>
<ss>Feeling this way, I believe we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reducing tensions and for introducing greater stability into the strategic calculus on both sides</ss>
<ss>One of the most important contributions we can make is, of course, to lower the level of all arms, and particularly nuclear arms</ss>
<ss>We're engaged right now in several negotiations with the <NORP> Union to bring about a mutual reduction of weapons</ss>
<ss>I will report to you <DATE> from <DATE> my thoughts on that score</ss>
<ss>But let me just say, I'm totally committed to this course</ss>
<ss>If the <NORP> Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance</ss>
<ss>Nevertheless, it will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation, on mutual threat</ss>
<ss>And that's a sad commentary on the human condition</ss>
<ss>Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them? Are we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a truly lasting stability? I think we are</ss>
<ss>Indeed, we must</ss>
<ss>After careful consultation with my advisers, including <ORG>, I believe there is a way</ss>
<ss>Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope</ss>
<ss>It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome <NORP> missile threat with measures that are defensive</ss>
<ss>Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy <DATE></ss>
<ss>What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant <PERSON> retaliation to deter a <NORP> attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies? I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may not be accomplished before <DATE></ss>
<ss>Yet, current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort</ss>
<ss>It will take <DATE>, probably <DATE> of effort on many fronts</ss>
<ss>There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs</ss>
<ss>And as we proceed, we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response</ss>
<ss>But isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war? We know it is</ss>
<ss>In the meantime, we will continue to pursue real reductions in nuclear arms, negotiating from a position of strength that can be ensured only by modernizing our strategic forces</ss>
<ss>At the same time, we must take steps to reduce the risk of a conventional military conflict escalating to nuclear war by improving our nonnuclear capabilities</ss>
<ss>America does possess -- now -- the technologies to attain very significant improvements in the effectiveness of our conventional, nonnuclear forces</ss>
<ss>Proceeding boldly with these new technologies, we can significantly reduce any incentive that the <NORP> Union may have to threaten attack against the United States or its allies</ss>
<ss>As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies, we recognize that our allies rely upon our strategic offensive power to deter attacks against them</ss>
<ss>Their vital interests and ours are inextricably linked</ss>
<ss>Their safety and ours are one</ss>
<ss>And no change in technology can or will alter that reality</ss>
<ss>We must and shall continue to honor our commitments</ss>
<ss>I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations and raise certain problems and ambiguities</ss>
<ss>If paired with offensive systems, they can be viewed as fostering an aggressive policy, and no one wants that</ss>
<ss>But with these considerations firmly in mind, I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete</ss>
<ss><TIME>, consistent with our obligations of the <LAW> treaty and recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies, I'm taking an important <ORDINAL> step</ss>
<ss>I am directing a comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long-term research and development program to begin to achieve our ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>This could pave the way for arms control measures to eliminate the weapons themselves</ss>
<ss>We seek neither military superiority nor political advantage</ss>
<ss>Our only purpose -- one all people share -- is to search for ways to reduce the danger of nuclear war</ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>, <TIME> we're launching an effort which holds the promise of changing the course of human history</ss>
<ss>There will be risks, and results take time</ss>
<ss>But I believe we can do it</ss>
<ss>As we cross this threshold, I ask for your prayers and your support</ss>
<ss>Thank you, good night, and <PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: I'm coming before you <TIME> about the <NORP> airline massacre, the attack by the <NORP> Union against 269 innocent men, women, and children aboard an unarmed <NORP> passenger plane</ss>
<ss>This crime against humanity must never be forgotten, here or throughout the world</ss>
<ss>Our prayers <TIME> are with the victims and their families in their time of terrible grief</ss>
<ss>Our hearts go out to them -- to brave people like <PERSON>, the wife of a <ORG>man whose composure and eloquence on <DATE> of her husband's death moved us all</ss>
<ss>He will be sorely missed by all of us here in government</ss>
<ss>The parents of one slain couple wired me: "Our daughter</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>and her husband</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>died on <PRODUCT></ss>
<ss>Their deaths were the result of the <NORP> Union violating every concept of human rights</ss>
<ss>" The emotions of these parents -- grief, shock, anger -- are shared by civilized people everywhere</ss>
<ss>From around the world press accounts reflect an explosion of condemnation by people everywhere</ss>
<ss>Let me state as plainly as I can: There was absolutely no justification, either legal or moral, for what the <NORP> did</ss>
<ss>One newspaper in India said, "If every passenger plane</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>is fair game for home air forces</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>it will be the end to civil aviation as we know it</ss>
<ss>" This is not the <ORDINAL> time the <NORP> Union has shot at and hit a civilian airliner when it overflew its territory</ss>
<ss>In another tragic incident in <DATE>, the <NORP> also shot down an unarmed civilian airliner after having positively identified it as such</ss>
<ss>In that instance, the <NORP> interceptor pilot clearly identified the civilian markings on the side of the aircraft, repeatedly questioned the order to fire on a civilian airliner, and was ordered to shoot it down anyway</ss>
<ss>The aircraft was hit with a missile and made a crash landing</ss>
<ss>Several innocent people lost their lives in this attack, killed by shrapnel from the blast of a <NORP> missile</ss>
<ss>Is this a practice of other countries in the world? The answer is no</ss>
<ss>Commercial aircraft from the <NORP> Union and Cuba on a number of occasions have overflown sensitive United States military facilities</ss>
<ss>They weren't shot down</ss>
<ss>We and other civilized countries believe in the tradition of offering help to mariners and pilots who are lost or in distress on the sea or in the air</ss>
<ss>We believe in following procedures to prevent a tragedy, not to provoke one</ss>
<ss>But despite the savagery of their crime, the universal reaction against it, and the evidence of their complicity, the <NORP> still refuse to tell the truth</ss>
<ss>They have persistently refused to admit that their pilot fired on the <NORP> aircraft</ss>
<ss>Indeed, they've not even told their own people that a plane was shot down</ss>
<ss>They have spun a confused tale of tracking the plane by radar until it just mysteriously disappeared from their radar screens, but no one fired a shot of any kind</ss>
<ss>But then they coupled this with charges that it was a spy plane sent by us and that their planes fired tracer bullets past the plane as a warning that it was in <NORP> airspace</ss>
<ss>Let me recap for a moment and present the incontrovertible evidence that we have</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> airliner, a <ORG> <PRODUCT>, left Anchorage, Alaska, bound for Seoul, Korea, on a course south and west which would take it across Japan</ss>
<ss>Out over the <LOC>, in international waters, it was for a brief time in the vicinity of one of our reconnaissance planes, an RC-135, on a routine mission</ss>
<ss>At no time was the RC-135 in <NORP> airspace</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> airliner flew on, and the two planes were soon widely separated</ss>
<ss>The <PRODUCT> is equipped with the most modern computerized navigation facilities, but a computer must respond to input provided by human hands</ss>
<ss>No one will ever know whether a mistake was made in giving the computer the course or whether there was a malfunction</ss>
<ss>Whichever, the <PRODUCT> was flying a course further to the west than it was supposed to fly -- a course which took it into <NORP> airspace</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> tracked this plane for <TIME> while it flew a straight-line course at <QUANTITY></ss>
<ss>Only civilian airliners fly in such a manner</ss>
<ss>At one point, the <NORP> pilot gave <NORP> air control his position as east of Hokkaido, Japan, showing that he was unaware they were off course by as much or more than a hundred miles</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> scrambled jet interceptors from a base in <LOC></ss>
<ss><NORP> ground sites recorded the interceptor planes' radio transmissions -- their conversations with their own ground control</ss>
<ss>We only have the voices from the pilots; the <NORP> ground-to-air transmissions were not recorded</ss>
<ss>It's plain, however, from the pilot's words that he's responding to orders and queries from his own ground control</ss>
<ss>Here is a brief segment of the tape which we're going to play in its entirety for <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>Those were the voices of the <NORP> pilots</ss>
<ss>In this tape, the pilot who fired the missile describes his search for what he calls the target</ss>
<ss>He reports he has it in sight; indeed, he pulls up to within <QUANTITY> of the <NORP> plane, mentions its flashing strobe light and that its navigation lights are on</ss>
<ss>He then reports he's reducing speed to get behind the airliner, gives his distance from the plane at various points in this maneuver, and finally announces what can only be called <ORG></ss>
<ss>He says he has locked on the radar, which aims his missiles, has launched those missiles, the target has been destroyed, and he is breaking off the attack</ss>
<ss>Let me point out something here having to do with his close-up view of the airliner on what we know was <TIME> with <TIME></ss>
<ss>The <PRODUCT> has a unique and distinctive silhouette, unlike any other plane in the world</ss>
<ss>There is no way a pilot could mistake this for anything other than a civilian airliner</ss>
<ss>And if that isn't enough, let me point out our RC-135 that I mentioned earlier had been back at its base in Alaska, on the ground for <TIME>, when the murderous attack took place over <LOC></ss>
<ss>And make no mistake about it, this attack was not just against ourselves or the Republic of Korea</ss>
<ss>This was the <NORP> Union against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere</ss>
<ss>It was an act of barbarism, born of a society which wantonly disregards individual rights and the value of human life and seeks constantly to expand and dominate other nations</ss>
<ss>They deny the deed, but in their conflicting and misleading protestations, the <NORP> reveal that, yes, shooting down a plane -- even one with hundreds of innocent men, women, children, and babies -- is a part of their normal procedure if that plane is in what they claim as their airspace</ss>
<ss>They owe the world an apology and an offer to join the rest of the world in working out a system to protect against this ever happening again</ss>
<ss>Among the rest of us there is one protective measure: an international radio wavelength on which pilots can communicate with planes of other nations if they are in trouble or lost</ss>
<ss><NORP> military planes are not so equipped, because that would make it easier for pilots who might want to defect</ss>
<ss>Our request to send vessels into <NORP> waters to search for wreckage and bodies has received no satisfactory answer</ss>
<ss>Bereaved families of the <NORP> victims were harassed by <NORP> patrol boats when they tried to get near where the plane is believed to have gone down in order to hold a ceremony for their dead</ss>
<ss>But we shouldn't be surprised by such inhuman brutality</ss>
<ss>Memories come back of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, the gassing of villages in Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>If the massacre and their subsequent conduct is intended to intimidate, they have failed in their purpose</ss>
<ss>From every corner of the globe the word is defiance in the face of this unspeakable act and defiance of the system which excuses it and tries to cover it up</ss>
<ss>With our horror and our sorrow, there is a righteous and terrible anger</ss>
<ss>It would be easy to think in terms of vengeance, but that is not a proper answer</ss>
<ss>We want justice and action to see that this never happens again</ss>
<ss>Our immediate challenge to this atrocity is to ensure that we make the skies safer and that we seek just compensation for the families of those who were killed</ss>
<ss>Since my return to Washington, we've held long meetings, the most recent <DATE> with the congressional leadership</ss>
<ss>There was a feeling of unity in the room, and I received a number of constructive suggestions</ss>
<ss>We will continue to work with the <ORG> regarding our response to this massacre</ss>
<ss>As you know, we immediately made known to the world the shocking facts as honestly and completely as they came to us</ss>
<ss>We have notified the <NORP> that we will not renew our bilateral agreement for cooperation in the field of transportation so long as they threaten the security of civil aviation</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE> the <NORP> airline <ORG> has been denied the right to fly to the United States</ss>
<ss>We have reaffirmed that order and are examining additional steps we can take with regard to <ORG> facilities in this country</ss>
<ss>We're cooperating with other countries to find better means to ensure the safety of civil aviation and to join us in not accepting <ORG> as a normal member of the international civil air community unless and until the <NORP> satisfy the cries of humanity for justice</ss>
<ss>I am pleased to report that Canada <DATE> suspended <ORG>'s landing and refueling privileges for <DATE></ss>
<ss>We have joined with other countries to press <ORG> to investigate this crime at an urgent special session of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>At the same time, we're listening most carefully to private groups, both <NORP> and international, airline pilots, passenger associations, and others, who have a special interest in civil air safety</ss>
<ss>I am asking the <ORG> to pass a joint resolution of condemnation of this <NORP> crime</ss>
<ss>We have informed the <NORP> that we're suspending negotiations on several bilateral arrangements we had under consideration</ss>
<ss>Along with Korea and Japan, we called an emergency meeting of <ORG> which began on <DATE></ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, France, China, the United Kingdom, Zaire, New Zealand, and West Germany all joined us in denouncing the <NORP> action and expressing our horror</ss>
<ss>We expect to hear from additional countries as debate resumes <DATE></ss>
<ss>We intend to work with the 13 countries who had citizens aboard the <NORP> airliner to seek reparations for the families of all those who were killed</ss>
<ss>The United States will be making a claim against the <NORP> Union within <DATE> to obtain compensation for the benefit of the victims' survivors</ss>
<ss>Such compensation is an absolute moral duty which the <NORP> must assume</ss>
<ss>In the economic area in general, we're redoubling our efforts with our allies to end the flow of military and strategic items to the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>Secretary <PERSON> is going to Madrid to meet with representatives of 35 countries who, for <DATE>, have been negotiating an agreement having to do with, among other things, human rights</ss>
<ss>Foreign Minister <PERSON> of the <NORP> Union is scheduled to attend that meeting</ss>
<ss>If he does come to the meeting, Secretary <PERSON> is going to present him with our demands for disclosure of the facts, corrective action, and concrete assurances that such a thing will not happen again and that restitution be made</ss>
<ss>As we work with other countries to see that justice is done, the real test of our resolve is whether we have the will to remain strong, steady, and united</ss>
<ss>I believe more than ever -- as evidenced by your thousands and thousands of wires and phone calls in <DATE> -- that we do</ss>
<ss>I have outlined some of the steps we're taking in response to the tragic massacre</ss>
<ss>There is something I've always believed in, but which now seems more important than ever</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> will be facing key national security issues when it returns from recess</ss>
<ss>There has been legitimate difference of opinion on this subject, I know, but I urge the Members of that distinguished body to ponder long and hard the <NORP>' aggression as they consider the security and safety of our people -- indeed, all people who believe in freedom</ss>
<ss>Senator <PERSON>, a wise and revered statesman and one who probably understood the <NORP> as well as any <NORP> in history, warned us, "the greatest threat the United States now faces is posed by the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>" But Senator <PERSON> said, "If America maintains a strong deterrent -- and only if it does -- this nation will continue to be a leader in the crucial quest for enduring peace among nations</ss>
<ss>" The late Senator made those statements in <DATE> on the <ORG> floor, speaking in behalf of the <PRODUCT> missile program he considered vital to restore America's strategic parity with the <NORP></ss>
<ss>When <PERSON> was President, defense spending as a share of the <ORG> budget was <PERCENT> greater than it is <DATE></ss>
<ss>Since then, the <NORP> Union has carried on the most massive military buildup the world has ever seen</ss>
<ss>Until they are willing to join the rest of the world community, we must maintain the strength to deter their aggression</ss>
<ss>But while we do so, we must not give up our effort to bring them into the world community of nations</ss>
<ss>Peace through strength as long as necessary, but never giving up our effort to bring peace closer through mutual, verifiable reduction in the weapons of war</ss>
<ss>I've told you of negotiations we've suspended as a result of the <NORP> airline massacre, but we cannot, we must not give up our effort to reduce the arsenals of destructive weapons threatening the world</ss>
<ss>Ambassador <PERSON> has returned to Geneva to resume the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Equally, we will continue to press for arms reductions in the <ORG> talks that resume in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We are more determined than ever to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the threat hanging over mankind</ss>
<ss>We know it will be hard to make a nation that rules its own people through force to cease using force against the rest of the world</ss>
<ss>But we must try</ss>
<ss>This is not a role we sought</ss>
<ss>We preach no manifest destiny</ss>
<ss>But like <NORP> who began this country and brought forth this last, best hope of mankind, history has asked much of the <NORP> of our own time</ss>
<ss>Much we have already given; much more we must be prepared to give</ss>
<ss>Let us have faith, in <PERSON> words, "that right makes might, and in that faith let us, to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it</ss>
<ss>" If we do, if we stand together and move forward with courage, then history will record that some good did come from this monstrous wrong that we will carry with us and remember for the rest of our lives</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>God bless you, and good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: Some 2 months ago we were shocked by the brutal massacre of 269 men, women, and children, more than 60 of them <NORP>, in the shooting down of a <NORP> airliner</ss>
<ss>Now, in <DATE>, violence has erupted again, in Lebanon and <PERSON></ss>
<ss>In Lebanon, we have some 1,600 <NORP>, part of a multinational force that's trying to help the people of Lebanon restore order and stability to that troubled land</ss>
<ss>Our <NORP> are assigned to the south of the city of Beirut, near the only airport operating in Lebanon</ss>
<ss><QUANTITY> or so to the north is the <NORP> contingent and not far from them, the <NORP> and a company of <NORP> soldiers</ss>
<ss>This past <DATE>, at <TIME> after 6 Beirut time, with dawn just breaking, a truck, looking like a lot of other vehicles in the city, approached the airport on a busy, main road</ss>
<ss>There was nothing in its appearance to suggest it was any different than the trucks or cars that were normally seen on and around the airport</ss>
<ss>But this one was different</ss>
<ss>At the wheel was a young man on a suicide mission</ss>
<ss>The truck carried <QUANTITY> of explosives, but there was no way our marine guards could know this</ss>
<ss>Their <ORDINAL> warning that something was wrong came when the truck crashed through a series of barriers, including a chain-link fence and barbed wire entanglements</ss>
<ss>The guards opened fire, but it was too late</ss>
<ss>The truck smashed through the doors of the headquarters building in which our <NORP> were sleeping and instantly exploded</ss>
<ss>The four-story concrete building collapsed in a pile of rubble</ss>
<ss>More than 200 of the sleeping men were killed in that one hideous, insane attack</ss>
<ss>Many others suffered injury and are hospitalized here or in <LOC></ss>
<ss>This was not the end of the horror</ss>
<ss>At almost the same instant, another vehicle on a suicide and murder mission crashed into the headquarters of the <NORP> peacekeeping force, an eight-story building, destroying it and killing more than 50 <NORP> soldiers</ss>
<ss>Prior to <DATE> of horror, there had been several tragedies for our men in the multinational force</ss>
<ss>Attacks by snipers and mortar fire had taken their toll</ss>
<ss>I called bereaved parents and/or widows of the victims to express on behalf of all of us our sorrow and sympathy</ss>
<ss>Sometimes there were questions</ss>
<ss>And now many of you are asking: Why should our young men be dying in Lebanon? Why is Lebanon important to us? Well, it's true, Lebanon is a small country, more than five-and-a-half thousand miles from our shores on the edge of what we call <LOC></ss>
<ss>But every President who has occupied this office in <DATE> has recognized that peace in <LOC> is of vital concern to our nation and, indeed, to our allies in <LOC> and Japan</ss>
<ss>We've been concerned because <LOC> is a powderkeg; four times in <DATE>, the <NORP> and <NORP> have gone to war</ss>
<ss>And each time, the world has teetered near the edge of catastrophe</ss>
<ss>The area is key to the economic and political life of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Its strategic importance, its energy resources, <LOC>, and the well-being of the nearly 200 million people living there -- all are vital to us and to world peace</ss>
<ss>If that key should fall into the hands of a power or powers hostile to the free world, there would be a direct threat to the United States and to our allies</ss>
<ss>We have another reason to be involved</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE> our Nation has recognized and accepted a moral obligation to assure the continued existence of Israel as a nation</ss>
<ss>Israel shares our democratic values and is a formidable force an invader of <LOC> would have to reckon with</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, Lebanon has been torn by internal strife</ss>
<ss>Once a prosperous, peaceful nation, its government had become ineffective in controlling the militias that warred on each other</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we were watching on our TV screens the shelling and bombing of Beirut which was being used as a fortress by <ORG> bands</ss>
<ss>Hundreds and hundreds of civilians were being killed and wounded in the <DATE> battles</ss>
<ss>Syria, which makes no secret of its claim that Lebanon should be a part of a Greater Syria, was occupying a large part of Lebanon</ss>
<ss><DATE>, Syria has become a home for 7,000 <NORP> advisers and technicians who man a massive amount of <NORP> weaponry, including SS-21 ground-to-ground missiles capable of reaching vital areas of Israel</ss>
<ss>A little over <DATE>, hoping to build on the <FAC> accords, which had led to peace between Israel and Egypt, I proposed a peace plan for <LOC> to end the wars between the <NORP> States and Israel</ss>
<ss>It was based on <LOC> resolutions 242 and 338 and called for a fair and just solution to the <NORP> problem, as well as a fair and just settlement of issues between the <NORP> States and Israel</ss>
<ss>Before the necessary negotiations could begin, it was essential to get all foreign forces out of Lebanon and to end the fighting there</ss>
<ss>So, why are we there? Well, the answer is straightforward: to help bring peace to Lebanon and stability to the vital <LOC></ss>
<ss>To that end, the multinational force was created to help stabilize the situation in Lebanon until a government could be established and a <NORP> <ORG> mobilized to restore <NORP> sovereignty over its own soil as the foreign forces withdrew</ss>
<ss>Israel agreed to withdraw as did Syria, but Syria then reneged on its promise</ss>
<ss>Over 10,000 <NORP> who had been bringing ruin down on Beirut, however, did leave the country</ss>
<ss>Lebanon has formed a government under the leadership of President <PERSON>, and that government, with our assistance and training, has set up its own <ORG></ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, that <ORG> has been rebuilt</ss>
<ss>It's a good <ORG>, composed of <NORP> of all factions</ss>
<ss>A few weeks ago, the <NORP> <ORG> pulled back to <LOC> in southern Lebanon</ss>
<ss>Despite fierce resistance by <NORP>-backed forces, the <NORP> <ORG> was able to hold the line and maintain the defensive perimeter around Beirut</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> that our <NORP> have been there, Lebanon has made important steps toward stability and order</ss>
<ss>The physical presence of the <NORP> lends support to both <ORG> and its <ORG></ss>
<ss>It allows the hard work of diplomacy to go forward</ss>
<ss>Indeed, without the peacekeepers from <LOC>, France, Italy, and Britain, the efforts to find a peaceful solution in Lebanon would collapse</ss>
<ss>As to that narrower question -- what exactly is the operational mission of the <NORP>-the answer is, to secure a piece of Beirut, to keep order in their sector, and to prevent the area from becoming a battlefield</ss>
<ss>Our <NORP> are not just sitting in an airport</ss>
<ss>Part of their task is to guard that airport</ss>
<ss>Because of their presence, the airport has remained operational</ss>
<ss>In addition, they patrol the surrounding area</ss>
<ss>This is their part -- a limited, but essential part -- in the larger effort that I've described</ss>
<ss>If our <NORP> must be there, I'm asked, why can't we make them safer? Who committed this latest atrocity against them and why? Well, we'll do everything we can to ensure that our men are as safe as possible</ss>
<ss>We ordered the battleship New Jersey to join our naval forces offshore</ss>
<ss>Without even firing them, the threat of its 16-inch guns silenced those who once fired down on our <NORP> from the hills, and they're a good part of the reason we suddenly had a ceasefire</ss>
<ss>We're doing our best to make our forces less vulnerable to those who want to snipe at them or send in future suicide missions</ss>
<ss>Secretary <PERSON> called me <DATE> from <LOC>, where he was meeting with <EVENT> of our allies in the multinational force</ss>
<ss>They remain committed to our task</ss>
<ss>And plans were made to share information as to how we can improve security for all our men</ss>
<ss>We have strong circumstantial evidence that the attack on the <NORP> was directed by terrorists who used the same method to destroy our <PRODUCT> in Beirut</ss>
<ss>Those who directed this atrocity must be dealt justice, and they will be</ss>
<ss>The obvious purpose behind the sniping and, now, this attack was to weaken <NORP> will and force the withdrawal of <PERSON> and <NORP> forces from Lebanon</ss>
<ss>The clear intent of the terrorists was to eliminate our support of <ORG> and to destroy the ability of the <NORP> people to determine their own destiny</ss>
<ss>To answer those who ask if we're serving any purpose in being there, let me answer a question with a question</ss>
<ss>Would the terrorists have launched their suicide attacks against the multinational force if it were not doing its job? The multinational force was attacked precisely because it is doing the job it was sent to do in Beirut</ss>
<ss>It is accomplishing its mission</ss>
<ss>Now then, where do we go from here? What can we do now to help Lebanon gain greater stability so that our <NORP> can come home? Well, I believe we can take three steps now that will make a difference</ss>
<ss>First, we will accelerate the search for peace and stability in that region</ss>
<ss>Little attention has been paid to the fact that we've had special envoys there working, literally, around the clock to bring the warring factions together</ss>
<ss>This coming <DATE> in Geneva, President <PERSON> of Lebanon will sit down with other factions from his country to see if national reconciliation can be achieved</ss>
<ss>He has our firm support</ss>
<ss>I will soon be announcing a replacement for <PERSON>, who was preceded by <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Both worked tirelessly and must be credited for much if not most of the progress we've made</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we'll work even more closely with our allies in providing support for the Government of Lebanon and for the rebuilding of a national consensus</ss>
<ss>Third, we will ensure that the multinational peace-keeping forces, our <NORP>, are given the greatest possible protection</ss>
<ss>Our Commandant of <ORG>, General <PERSON>, returned from Lebanon <DATE> and will be advising us on steps we can take to improve security</ss>
<ss>Vice President <PERSON> returned <TIME> from Beirut and gave me a full report of his brief visit</ss>
<ss>Beyond our progress in Lebanon, let us remember that our main goal and purpose is to achieve a broader peace in all of <LOC></ss>
<ss>The factions and bitterness that we see in Lebanon are just a microcosm of the difficulties that are spread across much of that region</ss>
<ss>A peace initiative for the entire <LOC>, consistent with the <FAC> accords and <LOC> resolutions 242 and 338, still offers the best hope for bringing peace to the region</ss>
<ss>Let me ask those who say we should get out of Lebanon: If we were to leave Lebanon now, what message would that send to those who foment instability and terrorism? If America were to walk away from Lebanon, what chance would there be for a negotiated settlement, producing a unified democratic Lebanon? If we turned our backs on Lebanon now, what would be the future of Israel? At stake is the fate of only the <ORDINAL> <NORP> country to negotiate a major agreement with Israel</ss>
<ss>That's another accomplishment of <DATE>, the <DATE> accord signed by Lebanon and Israel</ss>
<ss>If terrorism and intimidation succeed, it'll be a devastating blow to the peace process and to Israel's search for genuine security</ss>
<ss>It won't just be Lebanon sentenced to a future of chaos</ss>
<ss>Can the United States, or the free world, for that matter, stand by and see <LOC> incorporated into the <NORP> bloc? What of <LOC> and Japan's dependence on <LOC> oil for the energy to fuel their industries? <LOC> is, as I've said, vital to our national security and economic well-being</ss>
<ss>Brave young men have been taken from us</ss>
<ss>Many others have been grievously wounded</ss>
<ss>Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted? They gave their lives in defense of our national security every bit as much as any man who ever died fighting in a war</ss>
<ss>We must not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from their courageous sacrifice</ss>
<ss>We're a nation with global responsibilities</ss>
<ss>We're not somewhere else in the world protecting someone else's interests; we're there protecting our own</ss>
<ss>I received a message from the father of a marine in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>He told me, "In a world where we speak of human rights, there is a sad lack of acceptance of responsibility</ss>
<ss>My son has chosen the acceptance of responsibility for the privilege of living in this country</ss>
<ss>Certainly in this country one does not inherently have rights unless the responsibility for these rights is accepted</ss>
<ss>" Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said that while he was waiting to learn if his son was one of the dead</ss>
<ss>I was thrilled for him to learn <DATE> that his son <PERSON> is alive and well and carrying on his duties in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>Let us meet our responsibilities</ss>
<ss>For longer than any of us can remember, the people of <LOC> have lived from war to war with no prospect for any other future</ss>
<ss>That dreadful cycle must be broken</ss>
<ss>Why are we there? Well, a <NORP> mother told one of our Ambassadors that her little girl had only attended school 2 of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, because of our presence there, she said her daughter could live a normal life</ss>
<ss>With patience and firmness, we can help bring peace to that strife-torn region -- and make our own lives more secure</ss>
<ss>Our role is to help the <NORP> put their country together, not to do it for them</ss>
<ss>Now, I know another part of the world is very much on our minds, a place much closer to our shores: <PERSON></ss>
<ss>The island is only twice the size of the District of Columbia, with a total population of about 110,000 people</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and a half dozen other <LOC> islands here were, until recently, <NORP> colonies</ss>
<ss>They're now independent states and members of the <NORP> <ORG></ss>
<ss>While they respect each other's independence, they also feel a kinship with each other and think of themselves as one people</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> trouble came to <PERSON></ss>
<ss><PERSON>, a protege of <PERSON>, staged a military coup and overthrew the government which had been elected under the constitution left to the people by the <NORP></ss>
<ss>He sought the help of Cuba in building an airport, which he claimed was for tourist trade, but which looked suspiciously suitable for military aircraft, including <NORP>-built long-range bombers</ss>
<ss>The six sovereign countries and one remaining colony are joined together in what they call <ORG></ss>
<ss>The six became increasingly alarmed as <PERSON> built an <ORG> greater than all of theirs combined</ss>
<ss>Obviously, it was not purely for defense</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, Prime Minister <PERSON> gave indications that he might like better relations with the United States</ss>
<ss>He even made a trip to our country and met with senior officials of <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>Whether he was serious or not, we'll never know</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, a small group in his militia seized him and put him under arrest</ss>
<ss>They were, if anything, more radical and more devoted to <PERSON>'s Cuba than he had been</ss>
<ss><DATE>, a crowd of citizens appeared before <PERSON>'s home, freed him, and escorted him toward the headquarters of the military council</ss>
<ss>They were fired upon</ss>
<ss>A number, including some children, were killed, and <PERSON> was seized</ss>
<ss>He and several members of his cabinet were subsequently executed, and a 24-hour shoot-to-kill curfew was put in effect</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was without a government, its only authority exercised by a self-proclaimed band of military men</ss>
<ss>There were then about 1,000 of our citizens on <PERSON>, 800 of them students in St</ss>
<ss>George's <ORG></ss>
<ss>Concerned that they'd be harmed or held as hostages, I ordered a flotilla of ships, then on its way to Lebanon with <NORP>, part of our regular rotation program, to circle south on a course that would put them somewhere in the vicinity of <PERSON> in case there should be a need to evacuate our people</ss>
<ss><DATE>, I was awakened in <TIME> and told that six members of <ORG>, joined by Jamaica and Barbados, had sent an urgent request that we join them in a military operation to restore order and democracy to <PERSON></ss>
<ss>They were proposing this action under the terms of a treaty, a mutual assistance pact that existed among them</ss>
<ss>These small, peaceful nations needed our help</ss>
<ss>Three of them don't have armies at all, and the others have very limited forces</ss>
<ss>The legitimacy of their request, plus my own concern for our citizens, dictated my decision</ss>
<ss>I believe our government has a responsibility to go to the aid of its citizens, if their right to life and liberty is threatened</ss>
<ss>The nightmare of our hostages in Iran must never be repeated</ss>
<ss>We knew we had little time and that complete secrecy was vital to ensure both the safety of the young men who would undertake this mission and the <NORP> they were about to rescue</ss>
<ss><ORG> worked around the clock to come up with a plan</ss>
<ss>They had little intelligence information about conditions on the island</ss>
<ss>We had to assume that several hundred <NORP> working on the airport could be military reserves</ss>
<ss>Well, as it turned out, the number was much larger, and they were a military force</ss>
<ss>Six hundred of them have been taken prisoner, and we have discovered a complete base with weapons and communications equipment, which makes it clear a <NORP> occupation of the island had been planned</ss>
<ss><TIME> we released the <ORDINAL> photos from <PERSON></ss>
<ss>They included pictures of a warehouse of military equipment-one of three we've uncovered so far</ss>
<ss>This warehouse contained weapons and ammunition stacked almost to the ceiling, enough to supply thousands of terrorists</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, we were told, was a friendly island paradise for tourism</ss>
<ss>Well, it wasn't</ss>
<ss>It was a <NORP>-<NORP> colony, being readied as a major military bastion to export terror and undermine democracy</ss>
<ss>We got there just in time</ss>
<ss>I can't say enough in praise of our military-<ORG> rangers and paratroopers, <ORG>, <ORG>, and <ORG> personnel-those who planned a brilliant campaign and those who carried it out</ss>
<ss>Almost instantly, our military seized the two airports, secured the campus where most of our students were, and are now in the mopping-up phase</ss>
<ss>It should be noted that in all the planning, a top priority was to minimize risk, to avoid casualties to our own men and also the <NORP> forces as much as humanly possible</ss>
<ss>But there were casualties, and we all owe a debt to those who lost their lives or were wounded</ss>
<ss>They were few in number, but even one is a tragic price to pay</ss>
<ss>It's our intention to get our men out as soon as possible</ss>
<ss>Prime Minister <PERSON> of <PERSON> -- I called that wrong; she pronounces it <PERSON> -- she is Chairman of <ORG></ss>
<ss>She's calling for help from <ORG> nations in giving the people their right to establish a constitutional government on <PERSON></ss>
<ss>We anticipate that the Governor General, a <NORP>, will participate in setting up a provisional government in the interim</ss>
<ss>The events in Lebanon and <PERSON>, though oceans apart, are closely related</ss>
<ss>Not only has Moscow assisted and encouraged the violence in both countries, but it provides direct support through a network of surrogates and terrorists</ss>
<ss>It is no coincidence that when the thugs tried to wrest control over <PERSON>, there were 30 <NORP> advisers and hundreds of <NORP> military and paramilitary forces on the island</ss>
<ss>At the moment of our landing, we communicated with the Governments of Cuba and the <NORP> Union and told them we would offer shelter and security to their people on <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Regrettably, <PERSON> ordered his men to fight to the death, and some did</ss>
<ss>The others will be sent to their homelands</ss>
<ss>You know, there was a time when our national security was based on a standing <ORG> here within our own borders and shore batteries of artillery along our coasts, and, of course, a navy to keep the sealanes open for the shipping of things necessary to our well-being</ss>
<ss>The-world has changed</ss>
<ss><DATE>, our national security can be threatened in faraway places</ss>
<ss>It's up to all of us to be aware of the strategic importance of such places and to be able to identify them</ss>
<ss><PERSON> once said that freedom is not something a nation can work for once and win forever</ss>
<ss>He said it's like an insurance policy; its premiums must be kept up to date</ss>
<ss>In order to keep it, we have to keep working for it and sacrificing for it just as long as we live</ss>
<ss>If we do not, our children may not know the pleasure of working to keep it, for it may not be theirs to keep</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, I've been more sure than I've ever been that we <NORP> of <DATE> will keep freedom and maintain peace</ss>
<ss>I've been made to feel that by the magnificent spirit of our young men and women in uniform and by something here in our Nation's Capital</ss>
<ss>In this city, where political strife is so much a part of our lives, I've seen <NORP> leaders in the <ORG> join their <NORP> colleagues, send a message to the world that we're all <NORP> before we're anything else, and when our country is threatened, we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of our men and women in <ORG></ss>
<ss>May I share something with you I think you'd like to know? It's something that happened to the Commandant of our <ORG>, General <PERSON>, while he was visiting our critically injured <NORP> in an <ORG> hospital</ss>
<ss>It says more than any of us could ever hope to say about the gallantry and heroism of these young men, young men who serve so willingly so that others might have a chance at peace and freedom in their own lives and in the life of their country</ss>
<ss>I'll let General <PERSON>'s words describe the incident</ss>
<ss>He spoke of a "young marine with more tubes going in and out of his body than I have ever seen in one body</ss>
<ss>" "He couldn't see very well</ss>
<ss>He reached up and grabbed my four stars, just to make sure I was who I said I was</ss>
<ss>He held my hand with a firm grip</ss>
<ss>He was making signals, and we realized he wanted to tell me something</ss>
<ss>We put a pad of paper in his hand -- and he wrote '<PERSON></ss>
<ss>'" Well, if you've been a marine or if, like myself, you're an admirer of the <NORP>, you know those words are a battle-cry, a greeting, and a legend in <ORG></ss>
<ss>They're marine shorthand for the motto of the <ORG> -- "<PERSON>" -- "always faithful</ss>
<ss>" General <PERSON> has a reputation for being a very sophisticated general and a very tough marine</ss>
<ss>But he cried when he saw those words, and who can blame him? That marine and all those others like him, living and dead, have been faithful to their ideals</ss>
<ss>They've given willingly of themselves so that a nearly defenseless people in a region of great strategic importance to the free world will have a chance someday to live lives free of murder and mayhem and terrorism</ss>
<ss>I think that young marine and all of his comrades have given every one of us something to live up to</ss>
<ss>They were not afraid to stand up for their country or, no matter how difficult and slow the journey might be, to give to others that last, best hope of a better future</ss>
<ss>We cannot and will not dishonor them now and the sacrifices they've made by failing to remain as faithful to the cause of freedom and the pursuit of peace as they have been</ss>
<ss>I will not ask you to pray for the dead, because they're safe in <PERSON>'s loving arms and beyond need of our prayers</ss>
<ss>I would like to ask you all -- wherever you may be in this blessed land -- to pray for these wounded young men and to pray for the bereaved families of those who gave their lives for our freedom</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: <DATE> we were shocked by the brutal massacre of 269 men, women, and children, more than 60 of them <NORP>, in the shooting down of a <NORP> airliner</ss>
<ss>Now, in <DATE>, violence has erupted again, in Lebanon and <PERSON></ss>
<ss>In Lebanon, we have some 1,600 <NORP>, part of a multinational force that's trying to help the people of Lebanon restore order and stability to that troubled land</ss>
<ss>Our <NORP> are assigned to the south of the city of Beirut, near the only airport operating in Lebanon</ss>
<ss><QUANTITY> or so to the north is the <NORP> contingent and not far from them, the <NORP> and a company of <NORP> soldiers</ss>
<ss>This past <DATE>, at <TIME> after 6 Beirut time, with dawn just breaking, a truck, looking like a lot of other vehicles in the city, approached the airport on a busy, main road</ss>
<ss>There was nothing in its appearance to suggest it was any different than the trucks or cars that were normally seen on and around the airport</ss>
<ss>But this one was different</ss>
<ss>At the wheel was a young man on a suicide mission</ss>
<ss>The truck carried <QUANTITY> of explosives, but there was no way our marine guards could know this</ss>
<ss>Their <ORDINAL> warning that something was wrong came when the truck crashed through a series of barriers, including a chain-link fence and barbed wire entanglements</ss>
<ss>The guards opened fire, but it was too late</ss>
<ss>The truck smashed through the doors of the headquarters building in which our <NORP> were sleeping and instantly exploded</ss>
<ss>The four-story concrete building collapsed in a pile of rubble</ss>
<ss>More than 200 of the sleeping men were killed in that one hideous, insane attack</ss>
<ss>Many others suffered injury and are hospitalized here or in <LOC></ss>
<ss>This was not the end of the horror</ss>
<ss>At almost the same instant, another vehicle on a suicide and murder mission crashed into the headquarters of the <NORP> peacekeeping force, an eight-story building, destroying it and killing more than 50 <NORP> soldiers</ss>
<ss>Prior to <DATE> of horror, there had been several tragedies for our men in the multinational force</ss>
<ss>Attacks by snipers and mortar fire had taken their toll</ss>
<ss>I called bereaved parents and/or widows of the victims to express on behalf of all of us our sorrow and sympathy</ss>
<ss>Sometimes there were questions</ss>
<ss>And now many of you are asking: Why should our young men be dying in Lebanon? Why is Lebanon important to us? Well, it's true, Lebanon is a small country, more than five-and-a-half thousand miles from our shores on the edge of what we call <LOC></ss>
<ss>But every President who has occupied this office in <DATE> has recognized that peace in <LOC> is of vital concern to our nation and, indeed, to our allies in <LOC> and Japan</ss>
<ss>We've been concerned because <LOC> is a powderkeg; four times in <DATE>, the <NORP> and <NORP> have gone to war</ss>
<ss>And each time, the world has teetered near the edge of catastrophe</ss>
<ss>The area is key to the economic and political life of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Its strategic importance, its energy resources, <LOC>, and the well-being of the nearly 200 million people living there -- all are vital to us and to world peace</ss>
<ss>If that key should fall into the hands of a power or powers hostile to the free world, there would be a direct threat to the United States and to our allies</ss>
<ss>We have another reason to be involved</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE> our Nation has recognized and accepted a moral obligation to assure the continued existence of Israel as a nation</ss>
<ss>Israel shares our democratic values and is a formidable force an invader of <LOC> would have to reckon with</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, Lebanon has been torn by internal strife</ss>
<ss>Once a prosperous, peaceful nation, its government had become ineffective in controlling the militias that warred on each other</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we were watching on our TV screens the shelling and bombing of Beirut which was being used as a fortress by <ORG> bands</ss>
<ss>Hundreds and hundreds of civilians were being killed and wounded in the <DATE> battles</ss>
<ss>Syria, which makes no secret of its claim that Lebanon should be a part of a Greater Syria, was occupying a large part of Lebanon</ss>
<ss><DATE>, Syria has become a home for 7,000 <NORP> advisers and technicians who man a massive amount of <NORP> weaponry, including SS-21 ground-to-ground missiles capable of reaching vital areas of Israel</ss>
<ss>A little over <DATE>, hoping to build on the <FAC> accords, which had led to peace between Israel and Egypt, I proposed a peace plan for <LOC> to end the wars between the <NORP> States and Israel</ss>
<ss>It was based on <LOC> resolutions 242 and 338 and called for a fair and just solution to the <NORP> problem, as well as a fair and just settlement of issues between the <NORP> States and Israel</ss>
<ss>Before the necessary negotiations could begin, it was essential to get all foreign forces out of Lebanon and to end the fighting there</ss>
<ss>So, why are we there? Well, the answer is straightforward: to help bring peace to Lebanon and stability to the vital <LOC></ss>
<ss>To that end, the multinational force was created to help stabilize the situation in Lebanon until a government could be established and a <NORP> <ORG> mobilized to restore <NORP> sovereignty over its own soil as the foreign forces withdrew</ss>
<ss>Israel agreed to withdraw as did Syria, but Syria then reneged on its promise</ss>
<ss>Over 10,000 <NORP> who had been bringing ruin down on Beirut, however, did leave the country</ss>
<ss>Lebanon has formed a government under the leadership of President <PERSON>, and that government, with our assistance and training, has set up its own <ORG></ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, that <ORG> has been rebuilt</ss>
<ss>It's a good <ORG>, composed of <NORP> of all factions</ss>
<ss>A few weeks ago, the <NORP> <ORG> pulled back to <LOC> in southern Lebanon</ss>
<ss>Despite fierce resistance by <NORP>-backed forces, the <NORP> <ORG> was able to hold the line and maintain the defensive perimeter around Beirut</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> that our <NORP> have been there, Lebanon has made important steps toward stability and order</ss>
<ss>The physical presence of the <NORP> lends support to both <ORG> and its <ORG></ss>
<ss>It allows the hard work of diplomacy to go forward</ss>
<ss>Indeed, without the peacekeepers from <LOC>, France, Italy, and Britain, the efforts to find a peaceful solution in Lebanon would collapse</ss>
<ss>As to that narrower question -- what exactly is the operational mission of the <NORP> -- the answer is, to secure a piece of Beirut, to keep order in their sector, and to prevent the area from becoming a battlefield</ss>
<ss>Our <NORP> are not just sitting in an airport</ss>
<ss>Part of their task is to guard that airport</ss>
<ss>Because of their presence, the airport has remained operational</ss>
<ss>In addition, they patrol the surrounding area</ss>
<ss>This is their part -- a limited, but essential part -- in the larger effort that I've described</ss>
<ss>If our <NORP> must be there, I'm asked, why can't we make them safer? Who committed this latest atrocity against them and why? Well, we'll do everything we can to ensure that our men are as safe as possible</ss>
<ss>We ordered the battleship New Jersey to join our naval forces offshore</ss>
<ss>Without even firing them, the threat of its 16-inch guns silenced those who once fired down on our <NORP> from the hills, and they're a good part of the reason we suddenly had a ceasefire</ss>
<ss>We're doing our best to make our forces less vulnerable to those who want to snipe at them or send in future suicide missions</ss>
<ss>Secretary <PERSON> called me <DATE> from <LOC>, where he was meeting with <EVENT> of our allies in the multinational force</ss>
<ss>They remain committed to our task</ss>
<ss>And plans were made to share information as to how we can improve security for all our men</ss>
<ss>We have strong circumstantial evidence that the attack on the <NORP> was directed by terrorists who used the same method to destroy our <PRODUCT> in Beirut</ss>
<ss>Those who directed this atrocity must be dealt justice, and they will be</ss>
<ss>The obvious purpose behind the sniping and, now, this attack was to weaken <NORP> will and force the withdrawal of <PERSON> and <NORP> forces from Lebanon</ss>
<ss>The clear intent of the terrorists was to eliminate our support of <ORG> and to destroy the ability of the <NORP> people to determine their own destiny</ss>
<ss>To answer those who ask if we're serving any purpose in being there, let me answer a question with a question</ss>
<ss>Would the terrorists have launched their suicide attacks against the multinational force if it were not doing its job? The multinational force was attacked precisely because it is doing the job it was sent to do in Beirut</ss>
<ss>It is accomplishing its mission</ss>
<ss>Now then, where do we go from here? What can we do now to help Lebanon gain greater stability so that our <NORP> can come home? Well, I believe we can take three steps now that will make a difference</ss>
<ss>First, we will accelerate the search for peace and stability in that region</ss>
<ss>Little attention has been paid to the fact that we've had special envoys there working, literally, around the clock to bring the warring factions together</ss>
<ss>This coming <DATE> in Geneva, President <PERSON> of Lebanon will sit down with other factions from his country to see if national reconciliation can be achieved</ss>
<ss>He has our firm support</ss>
<ss>I will soon be announcing a replacement for <PERSON>, who was preceded by <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Both worked tirelessly and must be credited for much if not most of the progress we've made</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we'll work even more closely with our allies in providing support for the Government of Lebanon and for the rebuilding of a national consensus</ss>
<ss>Third, we will ensure that the multinational peace-keeping forces, our <NORP>, are given the greatest possible protection</ss>
<ss>Our Commandant of <ORG>, General <PERSON>, returned from Lebanon <DATE> and will be advising us on steps we can take to improve security</ss>
<ss>Vice President <PERSON> returned <TIME> from Beirut and gave me a full report of his brief visit</ss>
<ss>Beyond our progress in Lebanon, let us remember that our main goal and purpose is to achieve a broader peace in all of <LOC></ss>
<ss>The factions and bitterness that we see in Lebanon are just a microcosm of the difficulties that are spread across much of that region</ss>
<ss>A peace initiative for the entire <LOC>, consistent with the <FAC> accords and <LOC> resolutions 242 and 338, still offers the best hope for bringing peace to the region</ss>
<ss>Let me ask those who say we should get out of Lebanon: If we were to leave Lebanon now, what message would that send to those who foment instability and terrorism? If America were to walk away from Lebanon, what chance would there be for a negotiated settlement, producing a unified democratic Lebanon? If we turned our backs on Lebanon now, what would be the future of Israel? At stake is the fate of only the <ORDINAL> <NORP> country to negotiate a major agreement with Israel</ss>
<ss>That's another accomplishment of <DATE>, the <DATE> accord signed by Lebanon and Israel</ss>
<ss>If terrorism and intimidation succeed, it'll be a devastating blow to the peace process and to Israel's search for genuine security</ss>
<ss>It won't just be Lebanon sentenced to a future of chaos</ss>
<ss>Can the United States, or the free world, for that matter, stand by and see <LOC> incorporated into the <NORP> bloc? What of <LOC> and Japan's dependence on <LOC> oil for the energy to fuel their industries? <LOC> is, as I've said, vital to our national security and economic well-being</ss>
<ss>Brave young men have been taken from us</ss>
<ss>Many others have been grievously wounded</ss>
<ss>Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted? They gave their lives in defense of our national security every bit as much as any man who ever died fighting in a war</ss>
<ss>We must not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from their courageous sacrifice</ss>
<ss>We're a nation with global responsibilities</ss>
<ss>We're not somewhere else in the world protecting someone else's interests; we're there protecting our own</ss>
<ss>I received a message from the father of a marine in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>He told me, "In a world where we speak of human rights, there is a sad lack of acceptance of responsibility</ss>
<ss>My son has chosen the acceptance of responsibility for the privilege of living in this country</ss>
<ss>Certainly in this country one does not inherently have rights unless the responsibility for these rights is accepted</ss>
<ss>" Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said that while he was waiting to learn if his son was one of the dead</ss>
<ss>I was thrilled for him to learn <DATE> that his son <PERSON> is alive and well and carrying on his duties in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>Let us meet our responsibilities</ss>
<ss>For longer than any of us can remember, the people of <LOC> have lived from war to war with no prospect for any other future</ss>
<ss>That dreadful cycle must be broken</ss>
<ss>Why are we there? Well, a <NORP> mother told one of our Ambassadors that her little girl had only attended school 2 of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, because of our presence there, she said her daughter could live a normal life</ss>
<ss>With patience and firmness, we can help bring peace to that strife-torn region -- and make our own lives more secure</ss>
<ss>Our role is to help the <NORP> put their country together, not to do it for them</ss>
<ss>Now, I know another part of the world is very much on our minds, a place much closer to our shores: <PERSON></ss>
<ss>The island is only twice the size of the District of Columbia, with a total population of about 110,000 people</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and a half dozen other <LOC> islands here were, until recently, <NORP> colonies</ss>
<ss>They're now independent states and members of the <NORP> <ORG></ss>
<ss>While they respect each other's independence, they also feel a kinship with each other and think of themselves as one people</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> trouble came to <PERSON></ss>

<ss>They were proposing this action under the terms of a treaty, a mutual assistance pact that existed among them</ss>
<ss>These small, peaceful nations needed our help</ss>
<ss>Three of them don't have armies at all, and the others have very limited forces</ss>
<ss>The legitimacy of their request, plus my own concern for our citizens, dictated my decision</ss>
<ss>I believe our government has a responsibility to go to the aid of its citizens, if their right to life and liberty is threatened</ss>
<ss>The nightmare of our hostages in Iran must never be repeated</ss>
<ss>We knew we had little time and that complete secrecy was vital to ensure both the safety of the young men who would undertake this mission and the <NORP> they were about to rescue</ss>
<ss><ORG> worked around the clock to come up with a plan</ss>

<ss>We had to assume that several hundred <NORP> working on the airport could be military reserves</ss>

<ss>Six hundred of them have been taken prisoner, and we have discovered a complete base with weapons and communications equipment, which makes it clear a <NORP> occupation of the island had been planned</ss>

<ss>This warehouse contained weapons and ammunition stacked almost to the ceiling, enough to supply thousands of terrorists</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, we were told, was a friendly island paradise for tourism</ss>
<ss>Well, it wasn't</ss>
<ss>It was a <NORP>-<NORP> colony, being readied as a major military bastion to export terror and undermine democracy</ss>
<ss>We got there just in time</ss>
<ss>I can't say enough in praise of our military -- <ORG> rangers and paratroopers, <ORG>, <ORG>, and <ORG> personnel -- those who planned a brilliant campaign and those who carried it out</ss>
<ss>Almost instantly, our military seized the two airports, secured the campus where most of our students were, and are now in the mopping-up phase</ss>
<ss>It should be noted that in all the planning, a top priority was to minimize risk, to avoid casualties to our own men and also the <NORP> forces as much as humanly possible</ss>
<ss>But there were casualties, and we all owe a debt to those who lost their lives or were wounded</ss>
<ss>They were few in number, but even one is a tragic price to pay</ss>
<ss>It's our intention to get our men out as soon as possible</ss>
<ss>Prime Minister <PERSON> of <PERSON> -- I called that wrong; she pronounces it <PERSON> -- she is Chairman of <ORG></ss>
<ss>She's calling for help from <ORG> nations in giving the people their right to establish a constitutional government on <PERSON></ss>
<ss>We anticipate that the Governor General, a <NORP>, will participate in setting up a provisional government in the interim</ss>
<ss>The events in Lebanon and <PERSON>, though oceans apart, are closely related</ss>
<ss>Not only has Moscow assisted and encouraged the violence in both countries, but it provides direct support through a network of surrogates and terrorists</ss>
<ss>It is no coincidence that when the thugs tried to wrest control over <PERSON>, there were 30 <NORP> advisers and hundreds of <NORP> military and paramilitary forces on the island</ss>
<ss>At the moment of our landing, we communicated with the Governments of Cuba and the <NORP> Union and told them we would offer shelter and security to their people on <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Regrettably, <PERSON> ordered his men to fight to the death, and some did</ss>
<ss>The others will be sent to their homelands</ss>
<ss>You know, there was a time when our national security was based on a standing <ORG> here within our own borders and shore batteries of artillery along our coasts, and, of course, a navy to keep the sealanes open for the shipping of things necessary to our well-being</ss>
<ss>The-world has changed</ss>
<ss><DATE>, our national security can be threatened in faraway places</ss>
<ss>It's up to all of us to be aware of the strategic importance of such places and to be able to identify them</ss>
<ss><PERSON> once said that freedom is not something a nation can work for once and win forever</ss>
<ss>He said it's like an insurance policy; its premiums must be kept up to date</ss>
<ss>In order to keep it, we have to keep working for it and sacrificing for it just as long as we live</ss>
<ss>If we do not, our children may not know the pleasure of working to keep it, for it may not be theirs to keep</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, I've been more sure than I've ever been that we <NORP> of <DATE> will keep freedom and maintain peace</ss>
<ss>I've been made to feel that by the magnificent spirit of our young men and women in uniform and by something here in our Nation's Capital</ss>
<ss>In this city, where political strife is so much a part of our lives, I've seen <NORP> leaders in the <ORG> join their <NORP> colleagues, send a message to the world that we're all <NORP> before we're anything else, and when our country is threatened, we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of our men and women in <ORG></ss>
<ss>May I share something with you I think you'd like to know? It's something that happened to the Commandant of our <ORG>, General <PERSON>, while he was visiting our critically injured <NORP> in an <ORG> hospital</ss>
<ss>It says more than any of us could ever hope to say about the gallantry and heroism of these young men, young men who serve so willingly so that others might have a chance at peace and freedom in their own lives and in the life of their country</ss>
<ss>I'll let General <PERSON>'s words describe the incident</ss>
<ss>He spoke of a "young marine with more tubes going in and out of his body than I have ever seen in one body</ss>
<ss>" "He couldn't see very well</ss>
<ss>He reached up and grabbed my four stars, just to make sure I was who I said I was</ss>
<ss>He held my hand with a firm grip</ss>
<ss>He was making signals, and we realized he wanted to tell me something</ss>
<ss>We put a pad of paper in his hand -- and he wrote '<PERSON></ss>
<ss>'" Well, if you've been a marine or if, like myself, you're an admirer of the <NORP>, you know those words are a battle-cry, a greeting, and a legend in <ORG></ss>
<ss>They're marine shorthand for the motto of the <ORG> -- "<PERSON>" -- "always faithful</ss>
<ss>" General <PERSON> has a reputation for being a very sophisticated general and a very tough marine</ss>
<ss>But he cried when he saw those words, and who can blame him? That marine and all those others like him, living and dead, have been faithful to their ideals</ss>
<ss>They've given willingly of themselves so that a nearly defenseless people in a region of great strategic importance to the free world will have a chance someday to live lives free of murder and mayhem and terrorism</ss>
<ss>I think that young marine and all of his comrades have given every one of us something to live up to</ss>
<ss>They were not afraid to stand up for their country or, no matter how difficult and slow the journey might be, to give to others that last, best hope of a better future</ss>
<ss>We cannot and will not dishonor them now and the sacrifices they've made by failing to remain as faithful to the cause of freedom and the pursuit of peace as they have been</ss>
<ss>I will not ask you to pray for the dead, because they're safe in <PERSON>'s loving arms and beyond need of our prayers</ss>
<ss>I would like to ask you all -- wherever you may be in this blessed land -- to pray for these wounded young men and to pray for the bereaved families of those who gave their lives for our freedom</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and my fellow <NORP>: A number of times in <DATE>, Members of <ORG> and a <PERSON> have come together in meetings like this to resolve a crisis</ss>
<ss>I have asked for this meeting in the hope that we can prevent one</ss>
<ss>It would be hard to find many <NORP> who aren't aware of our stake in <LOC>, <LOC>, or the <ORG> line dividing the free world from the <NORP> bloc</ss>
<ss>And the same could be said for <LOC></ss>
<ss>But in spite of, or maybe because of, a flurry of stories about places like Nicaragua and El Salvador and, yes, some concerted propaganda, many of us find it hard to believe we have a stake in problems involving those countries</ss>
<ss>Too many have thought of <LOC> as just that place way down below Mexico that can't possibly constitute a threat to our well-being</ss>
<ss>And that's why I've asked for this session</ss>
<ss><LOC> problems do directly affect the security and the well-being of our own people</ss>
<ss>And <LOC> is much closer to the United <ORG>s than many of the world troublespots that concern us</ss>
<ss>So, we work to restore our own economy; we cannot afford to lose sight of our neighbors to the south</ss>
<ss>El Salvador is nearer to Texas than Texas is to Massachusetts</ss>
<ss>Nicaragua is just as close to Miami, San Antonio, San Diego, and <PERSON> as those cities are to Washington, where we're gathered <TIME></ss>
<ss>But nearness on the map doesn't even begin to tell the strategic importance of <LOC>, bordering as it does on the <LOC> -- our lifeline to the outside world</ss>
<ss>Two-<ORDINAL>s of all our foreign trade and petroleum pass through <FAC> and the <LOC></ss>
<ss>In a <NORP> crisis at least half of our supplies for <ORG> would go through these areas by sea</ss>
<ss>It's well to remember that in <DATE>, a handful of <PERSON>'s submarines sank more tonnage there than in all of <LOC></ss>
<ss>And they did this without a single naval base anywhere in the area</ss>
<ss>And <DATE>, the situation is different</ss>
<ss>Cuba is host to a <NORP> combat brigade, a submarine base capable of servicing <NORP> submarines, and military air bases visited regularly by <NORP> military aircraft</ss>
<ss>Because of its importance, <LOC> is a magnet for adventurism</ss>
<ss>We're all aware of the <NORP> cargo planes refueling in Brazil <DATE> on their way to deliver "medical supplies" to Nicaragua</ss>
<ss><NORP> authorities discovered the so-called medical supplies were actually munitions and prevented their delivery</ss>
<ss>You may remember that <DATE>, speaking on national television, I showed an aerial photo of an airfield being built on the island of Grenada</ss>
<ss>Well, if that airfield had been completed, those planes could have refueled there and completed their journey</ss>
<ss>If the <NORP> during <EVENT> and the <NORP> <DATE> could recognize the <LOC> and <LOC> as vital to our interests, shouldn't we, also? For <DATE> now, under two administrations, the United <ORG>s has been increasing its defense of freedom in <LOC></ss>
<ss>And I can tell you <TIME>, democracy is beginning to take root in El Salvador, which, until <DATE>, knew only dictatorship</ss>
<ss>The new government is now delivering on its promises of democracy, reforms, and free elections</ss>
<ss>It wasn't easy, and there was resistance to many of the attempted reforms, with assassinations of some of the reformers</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bands and urban terrorists were portrayed in a worldwide propaganda campaign as freedom fighters, representative of the people</ss>
<ss><DATE> before I came into office, the guerrillas launched what they called "a final offensive" to overthrow the government</ss>
<ss>And their radio boasted that our new administration would be too late to prevent their victory</ss>
<ss>Well, they learned that democracy cannot be so easily defeated</ss>
<ss><PERSON> <PERSON> did not hesitate</ss>
<ss>He authorized arms and munitions to El Salvador</ss>
<ss>The guerrilla offensive failed, but not America's will</ss>
<ss>Every <PERSON> since this country assumed global responsibilities has known that those responsibilities could only be met if we pursued a bipartisan foreign policy</ss>
<ss>As I said a moment ago, the Government of El Salvador has been keeping its promises, like the land reform program which is making thousands of farm tenants, farm owners</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, <PERCENT> of the arable land in El Salvador has been redistributed to more than 450,000 people</ss>
<ss>That's one in ten <NORP> who have benefited directly from this program</ss>
<ss>El Salvador has continued to strive toward an orderly and democratic society</ss>
<ss>The government promised free elections</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, a little more than a year ago, after <DATE> of campaigning by a variety of candidates, the suffering people of El Salvador were offered a chance to vote, to choose the kind of government they wanted</ss>
<ss>And suddenly, the so-called freedom fighters in the hills were exposed for what they really are -- a small minority who want power for themselves and their backers, not democracy for the people</ss>
<ss>The guerrillas threatened death to anyone who voted</ss>
<ss>They destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from getting to the polling places</ss>
<ss>Their slogan was brutal: "Vote <DATE>, die <TIME></ss>
<ss>" But on <DATE>, <PERCENT> of the electorate braved ambush and gunfire and trudged for miles, many of them, to vote for freedom</ss>
<ss>Now, that's truly fighting for freedom</ss>
<ss>We can never turn our backs on that</ss>
<ss>Members of this <ORG> who went there as observers told me of a woman who was wounded by rifle fire on the way to the polls, who refused to leave the line to have her wound treated until after she had voted</ss>
<ss>Another woman had been told by the guerrillas that she would be killed when she returned from the polls, and she told the guerrillas, "You can kill me, you can kill my family, you can kill my neighbors</ss>
<ss>You can't kill us all</ss>
<ss>" The real freedom fighters of El Salvador turned out to be the people of that country -- the young, the old, the in-between -- more than a million of them out of a population of <MONEY></ss>
<ss>The world should respect this courage and not allow it to be belittled or forgotten</ss>
<ss>And again I say, in good conscience, we can never turn our backs on that</ss>
<ss>The democratic political parties and factions in El Salvador are coming together around the common goal of seeking a political solution to their country's problems</ss>
<ss>New national elections will be held <DATE>, and they will be open to all political parties</ss>
<ss>The government has invited the guerrillas to participate in the election and is preparing an amnesty law</ss>
<ss>The people of El Salvador are earning their freedom, and they deserve our moral and material support to protect it</ss>
<ss>Yes, there are still major problems regarding human rights, the criminal justice system, and violence against noncombatants</ss>
<ss>And, like the rest of <LOC>, El Salvador also faces severe economic problems</ss>
<ss>But in addition to recession-depressed prices for major agricultural exports, El Salvador's economy is being deliberately sabotaged</ss>
<ss><TIME> in El Salvador -- because of ruthless guerrilla attacks -- much of the fertile land cannot be cultivated; less than half the rolling stock of the railways remains operational; bridges, water facilities, telephone and electric systems have been destroyed and damaged</ss>
<ss>In one 22-month period, there were 5,000 interruptions of electrical power</ss>
<ss>One region was without electricity for <DATE></ss>
<ss>I think Secretary of <ORG> <PERSON> put it very well the other day: "Unable to win the free loyalty of El Salvador's people, the guerrillas," he said, "are deliberately and systematically depriving them of food, water, transportation, light, sanitation, and jobs</ss>
<ss>And these are the people who claim they want to help the common people</ss>
<ss>" They don't want elections because they know they'd be defeated</ss>
<ss>But, as the previous election showed, the <NORP> people's desire for democracy will not be defeated</ss>
<ss>The guerrillas are not embattled peasants, armed with muskets</ss>
<ss>They're professionals, sometimes with better training and weaponry than the government's soldiers</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> battalions that have received <PERSON> training have been conducting themselves well on the battlefield and with the civilian population</ss>
<ss>But so far, we've only provided enough money to train one <NORP> soldier out of ten, fewer than the number of guerrillas that are trained by Nicaragua and Cuba</ss>
<ss>And let me set the record straight on Nicaragua, a country next to El Salvador</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> when the new government took over in Nicaragua, after a revolution which overthrew the authoritarian rule of <LOC>, everyone hoped for the growth of democracy</ss>
<ss>We in the United <ORG>s did, too</ss>
<ss>By <DATE>, our emergency relief and recovery aid to Nicaragua totalled <MONEY>-more than provided by any other developed country</ss>
<ss>In fact, in <DATE> of <NORP> rule, the United <ORG>s directly or indirectly sent five times more aid to Nicaragua than it had in <DATE> prior to the revolution</ss>
<ss>Can anyone doubt the generosity and the good faith of the <NORP> people? These were hardly the actions of a nation implacably hostile to Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>Yet, the Government of Nicaragua has treated us as an enemy</ss>
<ss>It has rejected our repeated peace efforts</ss>
<ss>It has broken its promises to us, to <ORG> and, most important of all, to the people of Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>No sooner was victory achieved than a small clique ousted others who had been part of the revolution from having any voice in the government</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, the Minister of Defense, declared <ORG> would be their guide, and so it is</ss>
<ss>The Government of Nicaragua has imposed a new dictatorship</ss>
<ss>It has refused to hold the elections it promised</ss>
<ss>It has seized control of most media and subjects all media to heavy prior censorship</ss>
<ss>It denied the bishops and priests of <ORG> the right to say Mass on radio during <EVENT></ss>
<ss>It insulted and mocked the Pope</ss>
<ss>It has driven the <NORP> from their homelands, burning their villages, destroying their crops, and forcing them into involuntary internment camps far from home</ss>
<ss>It has moved against the private sector and free labor unions</ss>
<ss>It condoned mob action against Nicaragua's <ORG> and drove the director of that commission into exile</ss>
<ss>In short, after all these acts of repression by the government, is it any wonder that opposition has formed? Contrary to propaganda, the opponents of the <NORP> are not diehard supporters of the previous <LOC> regime</ss>
<ss>In fact, many are anti-<LOC> heroes and fought beside the <NORP> to bring down the <LOC> government</ss>
<ss>Now they've been denied any part in the new government because they truly wanted democracy for Nicaragua and they still do</ss>
<ss>Others are <NORP> fighting for their homes, their lands, and their lives</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> revolution in Nicaragua turned out to be just an exchange of one set of autocratic rulers for another, and the people still have no freedom, no democratic rights, and more poverty</ss>
<ss>Even worse than its predecessor, it is helping Cuba and the <NORP> to destabilize our hemisphere</ss>
<ss>Meanwhile, the Government of El Salvador, making every effort to guarantee democracy, free labor unions, freedom of religion, and a free press, is under attack by guerrillas dedicated to the same philosophy that prevails in Nicaragua, Cuba, and, yes, the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>Violence has been Nicaragua's most important export to the world</ss>
<ss>It is the ultimate in hypocrisy for the unelected <NORP> Government to charge that we seek their overthrow, when they're doing everything they can to bring down the elected Government of El Salvador</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>The guerrilla attacks are directed from a headquarters in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>But let us be clear as to the <NORP> attitude toward the Government of Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>We do not seek its overthrow</ss>
<ss>Our interest is to ensure that it does not infect its neighbors through the export of subversion and violence</ss>
<ss>Our purpose, in conformity with <NORP> and international law, is to prevent the flow of arms to El Salvador, Honduras, <PERSON>, and Costa Rica</ss>
<ss>We have attempted to have a dialog with the Government of Nicaragua, but it persists in its efforts to spread violence</ss>
<ss>We should not, and we will not, protect <ORG> from the anger of its own people</ss>
<ss>But we should, through diplomacy, offer an alternative</ss>
<ss>And as Nicaragua ponders its options, we can and will -- with all the resources of diplomacy-protect each country of <LOC> from the danger of war</ss>
<ss>Even Costa Rica, <LOC> oldest and strongest democracy -- a government so peaceful it doesn't even have an army -- is the object of bullying and threats from Nicaragua's dictators</ss>
<ss>Nicaragua's neighbors know that <NORP> promises of peace, nonalliance, and nonintervention have not been kept</ss>
<ss>Some 36 new military bases have been built</ss>
<ss>There were only 13 during <DATE></ss>
<ss>Nicaragua's new army numbers 25,000 men, supported by a militia of 50,000</ss>
<ss>It is the largest army in <LOC>, supplemented by 2,000 <NORP> military and security advisers</ss>
<ss>It is equipped with the most modern weapons-dozens of <NORP>-made tanks, 800 <NORP>bloc trucks, <NORP> 152-millimeter howitzers, 100 anti-aircraft guns, plus planes and helicopters</ss>
<ss>There are additional thousands of civilian advisers from Cuba, the <NORP> Union, East Germany, Libya, and the <ORG></ss>
<ss>And we're attacked because we have 55 military trainers in El Salvador</ss>
<ss>The goal of the professional guerrilla movements in <LOC> is as simple as it is sinister: to destabilize the entire region from <FAC> to Mexico</ss>
<ss>And if you doubt beyond this point, just consider what <PERSON>, the now-deceased <NORP> guerrilla leader, said <DATE></ss>
<ss><ORG> said that after El Salvador falls, El Salvador and Nicaragua would be "arm-in-arm and struggling for the total liberation of <LOC></ss>
<ss>" Nicaragua's dictatorial junta, who themselves made war and won power operating from bases in Honduras and Costa Rica, like to pretend that they are <DATE> being attacked by forces based in Honduras</ss>
<ss>The fact is, it is Nicaragua's government that threatens Honduras, not the reverse</ss>
<ss>It is Nicaragua who has moved heavy tanks close to the border, and Nicaragua who speaks of war</ss>
<ss>It was <NORP> radio that announced on <DATE> the creation of a new, unified, <ORG> to push forward the <NORP> struggle in Honduras</ss>
<ss>Nicaragua, supported by weapons and military resources provided by the <NORP> bloc, represses its own people, refuses to make peace, and sponsors a guerrilla war against El Salvador</ss>
<ss><PERSON> <PERSON>'s words are as apt <DATE> as they were in <DATE> when he, too, spoke before a joint session of the <ORG>: "At the present moment in world history, nearly every nation must choose between alternate ways of life</ss>
<ss>The choice is not too often a free one</ss>
<ss>One way of life is based upon the will of the majority and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority</ss>
<ss>It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms</ss>
<ss>" "I believe that it must be the policy of the United <ORG>s to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures</ss>
<ss>I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way</ss>
<ss>I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes</ss>
<ss>" "Collapse of free institutions and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for them but for the world</ss>
<ss>Discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples striving to maintain their freedom and independence</ss>
<ss>" The countries of <LOC> are smaller than the nations that prompted <PERSON> <PERSON>'s message</ss>
<ss>But the political and strategic stakes are the same</ss>
<ss>Will our response -- economic, social, military -- be as appropriate and successful as Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s bold solutions to the problems of postwar <LOC>? Some people have forgotten the successes of <DATE> and the <DATE> of peace, prosperity, and freedom they secured</ss>
<ss>Some people talk as though the United <ORG>s were incapable of acting effectively in international affairs without risking war or damaging those we seek to help</ss>
<ss>Are democracies required to remain passive while threats to their security and prosperity accumulate? Must we just accept the destabilization of an entire region from <FAC> to Mexico on our southern border? Must we sit by while independent nations of this hemisphere are integrated into the most aggressive empire the modern world has seen? Must we wait while <NORP> are driven from their homes like the more than a million who've sought refuge out of Afghanistan, or the 1 1/2 million who have fled Indochina, or the more than a million <NORP> who have fled <PERSON>'s <LOC> utopia? Must we, by default, leave the people of El Salvador no choice but to flee their homes, creating another tragic human exodus? I don't believe there's a majority in the <ORG> or the country that counsels passivity, resignation, defeatism, in the face of this challenge to freedom and security in our own hemisphere</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>I do not believe that a majority of the <ORG> or the country is prepared to stand by passively while the people of <LOC> are delivered to totalitarianism and we ourselves are left vulnerable to new dangers</ss>
<ss><DATE>, an official of the <NORP> Union reiterated <ORG>'s threat to station nuclear missiles in this hemisphere, <TIME> from the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>Like an echo, Nicaragua's <ORG> confirmed that, if asked, his country would consider accepting those missiles</ss>
<ss>I understand that <DATE> they may be having <ORDINAL> thoughts</ss>
<ss>Now, before I go any further, let me say to those who invoke the memory of Vietnam, there is no thought of sending <NORP> combat troops to <LOC></ss>
<ss>They are not needed --  Thank you</ss>
<ss>And, as I say, they are not needed and, indeed, they have not been requested there</ss>
<ss>All our neighbors ask of us is assistance in training and arms to protect themselves while they build a better, freer life</ss>
<ss>We must continue to encourage peace among the nations of <LOC></ss>
<ss>We must support the regional efforts now underway to promote solutions to regional problems</ss>
<ss>We cannot be certain that the <NORP>-Leninist bands who believe war is an instrument of politics will be readily discouraged</ss>
<ss>It's crucial that we not become discouraged before they do</ss>
<ss>Otherwise, the region's freedom will be lost and our security damaged in ways that can hardly be calculated</ss>
<ss>If <LOC> were to fall, what would the consequences be for our position in <LOC>, <LOC>, and for alliances such as <ORG>? If the United <ORG>s cannot respond to a threat near our own borders, why should <NORP> or <NORP> believe that we're seriously concerned about threats to them? If the <NORP> can assume that nothing short of an actual attack on the United <ORG>s will provoke an <NORP> response, which ally, which friend will trust us then? The <ORG> shares both the power and the responsibility for our foreign policy</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I ask you, the <ORG>, to join me in a bold, generous approach to the problems of peace and poverty, democracy and dictatorship in the region</ss>
<ss>Join me in a program that prevents <NORP> victory in the short run, but goes beyond, to produce for the deprived people of the area the reality of present progress and the promise of more to come</ss>
<ss>Let us lay the foundation for a bipartisan approach to sustain the independence and freedom of the countries of <LOC></ss>
<ss>We in the administration reach out to you in this spirit</ss>
<ss>We will pursue four basic goals in <LOC>: First, in response to <DATE> of inequity and indifference, we will support democracy, reform, and human freedom</ss>
<ss>This means using our assistance, our powers of persuasion, and our legitimate leverage to bolster humane democratic systems where they already exist and to help countries on their way to that goal complete the process as quickly as human institutions can be changed</ss>
<ss>Elections in El Salvador and also in Nicaragua must be open to all, fair and safe</ss>
<ss>The international community must help</ss>
<ss>We will work at human rights problems, not walk away from them</ss>
<ss>Second, in response to the challenge of world recession and, in the case of El Salvador, to the unrelenting campaign of economic sabotage by the guerrillas, we will support economic development</ss>
<ss>And by a margin of 2 to 1 our aid is economic now, not military</ss>
<ss><MONEY> out of every dollar we will spend in the area <DATE> goes for food, fertilizers, and other essentials for economic growth and development</ss>
<ss>And our economic program goes beyond traditional aid</ss>
<ss>The <LOC> Initiative introduced in the <ORG> <TIME> will provide powerful trade and investment incentives to help these countries achieve self-sustaining economic growth without exporting <PERSON> jobs</ss>
<ss>Our goal must be to focus our immense and growing technology to enhance health care, agriculture, industry, and to ensure that we who inhabit this interdependent region come to know and understand each other better, retaining our diverse identities, respecting our diverse traditions and institutions</ss>
<ss>And, <ORDINAL>, in response to the military challenge from Cuba and Nicaragua -- to their deliberate use of force to spread tyranny -- we will support the security of the region's threatened nations</ss>
<ss>We do not view security assistance as an end in itself, but as a shield for democratization, economic development, and diplomacy</ss>
<ss>No amount of reform will bring peace so long as guerrillas believe they will win by force</ss>
<ss>No amount of economic help will suffice if guerrilla units can destroy roads and bridges and power stations and crops, again and again, with impunity</ss>
<ss>But with better training and material help, our neighbors can hold off the guerrillas and give democratic reform time to take root</ss>
<ss>And, <ORDINAL>, we will support dialog and negotiations both among the countries of the region and within each country</ss>
<ss>The terms and conditions of participation in elections are negotiable</ss>
<ss>Costa Rica is a shining example of democracy</ss>
<ss>Honduras has made the move from military rule to democratic government</ss>
<ss><PERSON> is pledged to the same course</ss>
<ss>The United <ORG>s will work toward a political solution in <LOC> which will serve the interests of the democratic process</ss>
<ss>To support these diplomatic goals, I offer these assurances: The United <ORG>s will support any agreement among <NORP> countries for the withdrawal, under fully verifiable and reciprocal conditions, of all foreign military and security advisers and troops</ss>
<ss>We want to help opposition groups join the political process in all countries and compete by ballots instead of bullets</ss>
<ss>We will support any verifiable, reciprocal agreement among <NORP> countries on the renunciation of support for insurgencies on neighbors' territory</ss>
<ss>And, finally, we desire to help <LOC> end its costly arms race and will support any verifiable, reciprocal agreements on the nonimportation of offensive weapons</ss>
<ss>To move us toward these goals more rapidly, I am <TIME> announcing my intention to name an Ambassador at Large as my special envoy to <LOC></ss>
<ss>He or she will report to me through the Secretary of <ORG></ss>
<ss>The Ambassador's responsibilities will be to lend <PERSON> support to the efforts of regional governments to bring peace to this troubled area and to work closely with the <ORG> to assure the fullest possible, bipartisan coordination of our policies toward the region</ss>
<ss>What I'm asking for is prompt congressional approval for the full reprogramming of funds for key current economic and security programs so that the people of <LOC> can hold the line against externally supported aggression</ss>
<ss>In addition, I am asking for prompt action on the supplemental request in these same areas to carry us through <DATE> and for early and favorable congressional action on my requests for <DATE></ss>
<ss>And finally, I am asking that the bipartisan consensus, which <DATE> acted on the trade and tax provisions of <LOC> Initiative in the <ORG>, again take the lead to move this vital proposal to the floor of both <ORG></ss>
<ss>And, as I said before, the greatest share of these requests is targeted toward economic and humanitarian aid, not military</ss>
<ss>What the administration is asking for on behalf of freedom in <LOC> is so small, so minimal, considering what is at stake</ss>
<ss>The total amount requested for aid to all of <LOC> in <DATE> is <MONEY></ss>
<ss>That's less than one-tenth of what <NORP> will spend <DATE> on coin-operated video games</ss>
<ss>In summation, I say to you that <TIME> there can be no question: The national security of all the <LOC> is at stake in <LOC></ss>
<ss>If we cannot defend ourselves there, we cannot expect to prevail elsewhere</ss>
<ss>Our credibility would collapse, our alliances would crumble, and the safety of our homeland would be put in jeopardy</ss>
<ss>We have a vital interest, a moral duty, and a solemn responsibility</ss>
<ss>This is not a partisan issue</ss>
<ss>It is a question of our meeting our moral responsibility to ourselves, our friends, and our posterity</ss>
<ss>It is a duty that falls on all of us -- the <PERSON>, the <ORG>, and the people</ss>
<ss>We must perform it together</ss>
<ss>Who among us would wish to bear responsibility for failing to meet our shared obligation? Thank you, God bless you, and good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mrs</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, members of the <PERSON> family, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, I'm very pleased to welcome you to <ORG>, the home that belongs to all of us, the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>When I was thinking of the contributions to our country of the man that we're honoring <DATE>, a passage attributed to the <NORP> poet <PERSON> comes to mind</ss>
<ss>"Each crisis brings its word and deed</ss>
<ss>" In America, in the fifties and sixties, one of the important crises we faced was racial discrimination</ss>
<ss>The man whose words and deeds in that crisis stirred our nation to the very depths of its soul was Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Jr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was born in <DATE> in an America where, because of the color of their skin, nearly 1 in 10 lived lives that were separate and unequal</ss>
<ss>Most black <NORP> were taught in segregated schools</ss>
<ss>Across the country, too many could find only poor jobs, toiling for low wages</ss>
<ss>They were refused entry into hotels and restaurants, made to use separate facilities</ss>
<ss>In a nation that proclaimed liberty and justice for all, too many black <NORP> were living with neither</ss>
<ss>In one city, a rule required all blacks to sit in the rear of public buses</ss>
<ss>But in <DATE>, when a brave woman named <PERSON> was told to move to the back of the bus, she said, "No</ss>
<ss>" A young minister in a local <NORP> church, <PERSON>, then organized a boycott of the bus company -- a boycott that stunned the country</ss>
<ss>Within <DATE> the courts had ruled the segregation of public transportation unconstitutional</ss>
<ss>Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> had awakened something strong and true, a sense that true justice must be colorblind, and that among white and black <NORP>, as he put it, "Their destiny is tied up with our destiny, and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom; we cannot walk alone</ss>
<ss>" In <DATE> after the bus boycott, Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> made equality of rights his life's work</ss>
<ss>Across the country, he organized boycotts, rallies, and marches</ss>
<ss>Often he was beaten, imprisoned, but he never stopped teaching nonviolence</ss>
<ss>"Work with the faith", he told his followers, "that unearned suffering is redemptive</ss>
<ss>" In <DATE> Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> became the youngest man in history to win <WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s work brought him to this city often</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE> in <DATE>, he addressed a quarter of a million people at <FAC></ss>
<ss>If <NORP> history grows from <DATE> to twenty, his words <DATE> will never be forgotten</ss>
<ss>"I have a dream that <DATE> on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood</ss>
<ss>" In <DATE> <PERSON> was gunned down by a brutal assassin, his life cut short at <DATE></ss>
<ss>But those <DATE> had changed America forever</ss>
<ss><LAW> of <DATE> had guaranteed all <NORP> equal use of public accommodations, equal access to programs financed by Federal funds, and the right to compete for employment on the sole basis of individual merit</ss>
<ss><LAW> of <DATE> had made certain that from then on black <NORP> would get to vote</ss>
<ss>But most important, there was not just a change of law; there was a change of heart</ss>
<ss>The conscience of America had been touched</ss>
<ss>Across the land, people had begun to treat each other not as blacks and whites, but as fellow <NORP></ss>
<ss>And since Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s death, his father, the Reverend <PERSON>, Sr</ss>
<ss>, and his wife, <PERSON>, have eloquently and forcefully carried on his work</ss>
<ss>Also his family have joined in that cause</ss>
<ss>Now our nation has decided to honor Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Jr</ss>
<ss>, by setting aside <DATE> to remember him and the just cause he stood for</ss>
<ss>We've made historic strides since <PERSON> refused to go to the back of the bus</ss>
<ss>As a democratic people, we can take pride in the knowledge that we <NORP> recognized a grave injustice and took action to correct it</ss>
<ss>And we should remember that in far too many countries, people like Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> never have the opportunity to speak out at all</ss>
<ss>But traces of bigotry still mar America</ss>
<ss>So, <DATE> on <PERSON>, let us not only recall Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, but rededicate ourselves to the Commandments he believed in and sought to live every day: Thou shall love thy <PERSON> with all thy heart, and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself</ss>
<ss>And I just have to believe that all of us -- if all of us, young and old, <NORP> and <NORP>, do all we can to live up to those Commandments, then we will see <DATE> when Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s dream comes true, and in his words, "All of <PERSON>'s children will be able to sing with new meaning, '</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring</ss>
<ss>'" Thank you, <PERSON> bless you, and I will sign it</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Officers and men and women of the corps, ladies and gentlemen, I came here <DATE> to pay homage to the heroes of Lebanon and Grenada</ss>
<ss>We grieve along with the families of these brave, proud <NORP> who have given their lives for their country and for the preservation of peace</ss>
<ss>I have just met with the families of many of those who were killed</ss>
<ss>I think all <NORP> would cradle them in our arms if we could</ss>
<ss>We share their sorrow</ss>
<ss>I want all of you who lost loved ones and friends to know that the thoughts and prayers of this nation are with you</ss>
<ss>If this country is to remain a force for good in the world, we'll face times like these, times of sadness and loss</ss>
<ss>Your fellow citizens know and appreciate that <NORP> and their families are carrying a heavy burden</ss>
<ss>America seeks no new territory, nor do we wish to dominate others</ss>
<ss>We commit our resources and risk the lives of those in our <ORG> to rescue others from bloodshed and turmoil and to prevent humankind from drowning in a sea of tyranny</ss>
<ss>In Lebanon, along with our allies, we're working hard to help bring peace to that war-torn country and stability to the vital <LOC></ss>
<ss>In seeking to stabilize the situation in Lebanon, you <NORP> and sailors-and our <NORP>, <NORP>, and <LANGUAGE> companions -- are peacekeepers in the truest sense of the word</ss>
<ss>The world looks to America for leadership</ss>
<ss>And America looks to the men in its <ORG> -- to <ORG>, to the <ORG>, the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Freedom is being tested throughout the world</ss>
<ss>In Burma, that government has announced conclusive evidence of <NORP> responsibility for the atrocity taking the lives of many members of <ORG></ss>
<ss>We stand with South Korea, and I will be going there <DATE> to carry our message to them, a message of revulsion of this atrocity, determination to stand with our friends in support of freedom</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> <TIME>, we have learned of yet another terrorist assault similar to the attack against our <NORP>, this time against an <NORP> site in Tyre, Lebanon</ss>
<ss>In spite of the complexity and special hardships of the <NORP> crisis, we have stood firm</ss>
<ss>As ever, leathernecks are willing to accept their mission and do their duty</ss>
<ss>This honest patriotism and dedication to duty overwhelms the rest of us</ss>
<ss>In Grenada, our military forces moved quickly and professionally to protect <NORP> lives and respond to an urgent request from <ORG></ss>
<ss>We joined in an effort to restore order and democracy to that strife-torn island</ss>
<ss><DATE> before our actions, Prime Minister <PERSON> had been brutally murdered, along with several members of his <ORG> and unarmed civilians</ss>
<ss>With a thousand <NORP>, including some 800 students, on that island, we weren't about to wait for the Iran crisis to repeat itself, only this time, in our own neighborhood-the <LOC></ss>
<ss>In a free society there's bound to be disagreement about any decisive course of action</ss>
<ss>Some of those so quick to criticize our operation in Grenada, I invite them to read the letters I've received from those students and their families</ss>
<ss>They know this was no invasion; they know it was a rescue mission</ss>
<ss><NORP> have a saying -- "We take care of our own</ss>
<ss>" Well, America, with the help of <NORP>, will take care of our own</ss>
<ss>And our brave <NORP>, soldiers, and special forces -- including the truly gallant <ORG> Seals -- were not just coming to the aid of our students</ss>
<ss>I hope every <NORP> will be able to hear the stories of the political prisoners who have been freed</ss>
<ss>The citizens of Grenada, who watched helplessly as their country was being stolen from them and turned into a staging area for <NORP> aggression -- these same <NORP> are hailing us as liberators, and they're doing everything they can now to help</ss>
<ss>Every <NORP> can be proud of the professional and gallant job that our <ORG> have done</ss>
<ss>And all of us can rejoice that they're coming home</ss>
<ss>I came here <DATE> to honor so many who did their duty and gave that last, full measure of their devotion</ss>
<ss>They kept faith with us and our way of life</ss>
<ss>We wouldn't be free long, but for the dedication of such individuals</ss>
<ss>They were heroes</ss>
<ss>We're grateful to have had them with us</ss>
<ss>The motto of <ORG>: "<PERSON>" -- always faithful</ss>
<ss>Well, the rest of us must remain always faithful to those ideals which so many have given their lives to protect</ss>
<ss>Our heritage of liberty must be preserved and passed on</ss>
<ss>Let no terrorist question our will or no tyrant doubt our resolve</ss>
<ss><NORP> have courage and determination, and we must not and will not be intimidated by anyone, anywhere</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE>, <NORP>, just like many of you, have shaped the strength and resolve of the United States</ss>
<ss>Your role is as important <DATE> as at any time in our history</ss>
<ss>Our hearts go out to the families of the brave men that we honor <DATE></ss>
<ss>Let us close ranks with them in tribute to our fallen heroes, their loved ones, who gave more than can ever be repaid</ss>
<ss>They're now part of the soul of this great country and will live as long as out liberty shines as a beacon of hope to all those who long for freedom and a better world</ss>
<ss>One of the men in <DATE> of our nation, <PERSON>, said, "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things</ss>
<ss>The ugliest is that man who thinks nothing is worth fighting or dying for and lets men better and braver than himself protect him</ss>
<ss>" You are doing that for all of us</ss>
<ss>God bless you, and thank you for what you're doing</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: It's been <DATE> since I <ORDINAL> spoke to you from this room</ss>
<ss>Together we've faced many difficult problems, and I've come to feel a special bond of kinship with each one of you</ss>
<ss><TIME> I'm here for a different reason</ss>
<ss>I've come to a difficult personal decision as to whether or not I should seek reelection</ss>
<ss>When I <ORDINAL> addressed you from here, our national defenses were dangerously weak, we had suffered humiliation in Iran, and at home we were adrift, possibly because of a failure here in Washington to trust the courage and character of you, the people</ss>
<ss>But worst of all, we were on the brink of economic collapse from <DATE> of government overindulgence and abusive overtaxation</ss>
<ss>Thus, I had to report that we were "in the worst economic mess since <EVENT></ss>
<ss>" Inflation had risen to <PERCENT> in <DATE> and to <PERCENT> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Those back-to-back <DATE> of price explosions were the highest in <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> before I came here, taxes had actually doubled</ss>
<ss>Your cost-of-living pay raises just bumped you into higher tax brackets</ss>
<ss>Interest rates <PERCENT>, the highest in <DATE>; productivity, down <DATE>; industrial production down; actual wages and earnings down -- the only things going up were prices, unemployment, taxes, and the size of government</ss>
<ss>While you tightened your belt, the federal government tightened its grip</ss>
<ss>Well, things have changed</ss>
<ss><DATE> inflation dropped down to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Interest rates, cut nearly in half</ss>
<ss>Retail sales are surging</ss>
<ss>Homes are being built and sold</ss>
<ss>Auto assembly lines are opening up</ss>
<ss>And in just <DATE>, 4 million people have found jobs -- the greatest employment gain in <DATE></ss>
<ss>By beginning to rebuild our defenses, we have restored credible deterrence and can confidently seek a secure and lasting peace, as well as a reduction in arms</ss>
<ss>As I said <DATE> <TIME>, America is back and standing tall</ss>
<ss>We've begun to restore great <NORP> values -- the dignity of work, the warmth of family, the strength of neighborhood, and the nourishment of human freedom</ss>
<ss>But our work is not finished</ss>
<ss>We have more to do in creating jobs, achieving control over government spending, returning more autonomy to the States, keeping peace in a more settled world, and seeing if we can't find room in our schools for <PERSON></ss>
<ss>At my inaugural, I quoted words that had been spoken over <DATE> by Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, president of <ORG></ss>
<ss>"On you depend the fortunes of America," he told his fellow <NORP></ss>
<ss>"You are to decide the important question on which rests the happiness and liberty of millions yet unborn</ss>
<ss>" And he added, "Act worthy of yourselves</ss>
<ss>" Over <DATE>, <PERSON> and I have been sustained by the way you, the real heroes of <NORP> democracy, have met Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s challenge</ss>
<ss>You were magnificent as we pulled the Nation through <TIME> of our national calamity</ss>
<ss>You have, indeed, acted worthy of yourselves</ss>
<ss>Your high standards make us remember the central question of public service: Why are we here? Well, we're here to see that government continues to serve you, not the other way around</ss>
<ss>We're here to lift the weak and to build the peace, and most important, we're here, as Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said, to act <DATE> for the happiness and liberty of millions yet unborn, to seize the future so that every new child of this beloved Republic can dream heroic dreams</ss>
<ss>If we do less, we betray the memory of those who have given so much</ss>
<ss>This historic room and the <ORG> belong to you</ss>
<ss>It is your right and responsibility <DATE> to give someone temporary custody of this office and of the institution of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>You so honored me, and I'm grateful -- grateful and proud of what, together, we have accomplished</ss>
<ss>We have made a new beginning</ss>
<ss>Vice President <PERSON> and I would like to have your continued support and cooperation in completing what we began <DATE></ss>
<ss>I am, therefore, announcing that I am a candidate and will seek reelection to the office I presently hold</ss>
<ss>Thank you for the trust you've placed in me</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and good <TIME></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>, <ORG> is <DATE> of ceremonies and speeches</ss>
<ss>Throughout America <DATE>, we honor the dead of our wars</ss>
<ss>We recall their valor and their sacrifices</ss>
<ss>We remember they gave their lives so that others might live</ss>
<ss>We're also gathered here for a special event -- the national funeral for an unknown soldier who will <DATE> join the heroes of three other wars</ss>
<ss>When he spoke at a ceremony at Gettysburg in <DATE>, President <PERSON> reminded us that through their deeds, the dead had spoken more eloquently for themselves than any of the living ever could, and that we living could only honor them by rededicating ourselves to the cause for which they so willingly gave a last full measure of devotion</ss>
<ss>Well, this is especially so <DATE>, for in our minds and hearts is the memory of Vietnam and all that that conflict meant for those who sacrificed on the field of battle and for their loved ones who suffered here at home</ss>
<ss>Not long ago, when a memorial was dedicated here in Washington to our Vietnam veterans, the events surrounding that dedication were a stirring reminder of America's resilience, of how our nation could learn and grow and transcend the tragedies of the past</ss>
<ss>During the dedication ceremonies, the rolls of those who died and are still missing were read for <DATE> in a candlelight ceremony at <FAC></ss>
<ss>And the veterans of Vietnam who were never welcomed home with speeches and bands, but who were never defeated in battle and were heroes as surely as any who have ever fought in a noble cause, staged their own parade on <FAC></ss>
<ss>As America watched them -- some in wheelchairs, all of them proud -- there was a feeling that this nation -- that as a nation we were coming together again and that we had, at long last, welcomed the boys home</ss>
<ss>"A lot of healing went on," said one combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial</ss>
<ss>And then there was this newspaper account that appeared after the ceremonies</ss>
<ss>I'd like to read it to you</ss>
<ss>"<DATE>, crowds returned to the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Among them was <PERSON>, a machinist and former marine from New Orleans</ss>
<ss>'<TIME>,' he said, standing near the wall, 'I went out to dinner with some other ex-marines</ss>
<ss>There was also a group of college students in the restaurant</ss>
<ss>We started talking to each other</ss>
<ss>And before we left, they stood up and cheered us</ss>
<ss><DATE>,' <ORG> said, his eyes red, 'it was worth it just for that</ss>
<ss>'" It has been worth it</ss>
<ss>We <NORP> have learned to listen to each other and to trust each other again</ss>
<ss>We've learned that government owes the people an explanation and needs their support for its actions at home and abroad</ss>
<ss>And we have learned, and I pray this time for good, the most valuable lesson of all -- the preciousness of human freedom</ss>
<ss>It has been a lesson relearned not just by <NORP> but by all the people of the world</ss>
<ss>Yet, while the experience of Vietnam has given us a stark lesson that ultimately must move the conscience of the world, we must remember that we cannot <DATE>, as much as some might want to, close this chapter in our history, for the war in <LOC> still haunts a small but brave group of <NORP> -- the families of those still missing in the Vietnam conflict</ss>
<ss>They live day and night with uncertainty, with an emptiness, with a void that we cannot fathom</ss>
<ss><DATE> some sit among you</ss>
<ss>Their feelings are a mixture of pride and fear</ss>
<ss>They're proud of their sons or husbands, fathers or brothers who bravely and nobly answered the call of their country</ss>
<ss>But some of them fear that this ceremony writes a final chapter, leaving those they love forgotten</ss>
<ss>Well, <DATE> then, one way to honor those who served or may still be serving in Vietnam is to gather here and rededicate ourselves to securing the answers for the families of those missing in action</ss>
<ss>I ask the Members of <ORG>, the leaders of veterans groups, and the citizens of an entire nation present or listening, to give these families your help and your support, for they still sacrifice and suffer</ss>
<ss>Vietnam is not over for them</ss>
<ss>They cannot rest until they know the fate of those they loved and watched march off to serve their country</ss>
<ss>Our dedication to their cause must be strengthened with these events <DATE></ss>
<ss>We write no last chapters</ss>
<ss>We close no books</ss>
<ss>We put away no final memories</ss>
<ss>An end to America's involvement in Vietnam cannot come before we've achieved the fullest possible accounting of those missing in action</ss>
<ss>This can only happen when their families know with certainty that this nation discharged her duty to those who served nobly and well</ss>
<ss><DATE> a united people call upon Hanoi with one voice: Heal the sorest wound of this conflict</ss>
<ss>Return our sons to America</ss>
<ss>End the grief of those who are innocent and undeserving of any retribution</ss>
<ss>The Unknown Soldier who is returned to us <DATE> and whom we lay to rest is symbolic of all our missing sons, and we will present him with <ORG>, the highest military decoration that we can bestow</ss>
<ss>About him we may well wonder, as others have: As a child, did he play on some street in a great <NORP> city? Or did he work beside his father on a farm out in America's heartland? Did he marry? Did he have children? Did he look expectantly to return to a bride? We'll never know the answers to these questions about his life</ss>
<ss>We do know, though, why he died</ss>
<ss>He saw the horrors of war but bravely faced them, certain his own cause and his country's cause was a noble one; that he was fighting for human dignity, for free men everywhere</ss>
<ss><DATE> we pause to embrace him and all who served us so well in a war whose end offered no parades, no flags, and so little thanks</ss>
<ss>We can be worthy of the values and ideals for which our sons sacrificed -- worthy of their courage in the face of a fear that few of us will ever experience -- by honoring their commitment and devotion to duty and country</ss>
<ss>Many veterans of Vietnam still serve in <ORG>, work in our offices, on our farms, and in our factories</ss>
<ss>Most have kept their experiences private, but most have been strengthened by their call to duty</ss>
<ss>A grateful nation opens her heart <DATE> in gratitude for their sacrifice, for their courage, and for their noble service</ss>
<ss>Let us, if we must, debate the lessons learned at some other time</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we simply say with pride, "Thank you, dear son</ss>
<ss>May God cradle you in His loving arms</ss>
<ss>" We present to you our nation's highest award, <ORG>, for service above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy during the Vietnam era</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>

<ss>We can be worthy of the values and ideals for which our sons sacrificed -- worthy of their courage in the face of a fear that few of us will ever experience -- by honoring their commitment and devotion to duty and country</ss>
<ss>Many veterans of Vietnam still serve in <ORG>, work in our offices, on our farms, and in our factories</ss>
<ss>Most have kept their experiences private, but most have been strengthened by their call to duty</ss>
<ss>A grateful nation opens her heart <DATE> in gratitude for their sacrifice, for their courage, and for their noble service</ss>
<ss>Let us, if we must, debate the lessons learned at some other time</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we simply say with pride, "Thank you, dear son</ss>
<ss>May God cradle you in His loving arms</ss>
<ss>" We present to you our nation's highest award, <ORG>, for service above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy during the Vietnam era</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Once again, in keeping with time-honored tradition, I have come to report to you on the state of the <ORG>, and I'm pleased to report that America is much improved, and there's good reason to believe that improvement will continue through <DATE> to come</ss>
<ss>You and I have had some honest and open differences in <DATE></ss>
<ss>But they didn't keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop a long decline that had drained this nation's spirit and eroded its health</ss>
<ss>There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land</ss>
<ss>America is back, standing tall, looking to <DATE> with courage, confidence, and hope</ss>
<ss>The problems we're overcoming are not the heritage of one person, party, or even one generation</ss>
<ss>It's just the tendency of government to grow, for practices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this <LOC></ss>
<ss>And there's always that well-intentioned chorus of voices saying, "With a little more power and a little more money, we could do so much for the people</ss>
<ss>" For a time we forgot the <NORP> dream isn't one of making government bigger; it's keeping faith with the mighty spirit of free people under <PERSON></ss>
<ss>As we came to <DATE> of <DATE>, we faced the worst crisis in our postwar history</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> of rising problems and falling confidence</ss>
<ss>There was a feeling government had grown beyond the consent of the governed</ss>
<ss>Families felt helpless in the face of mounting inflation and the indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work, thrift, and risktaking</ss>
<ss>All this was overlaid by an evergrowing web of rules and regulations</ss>
<ss>On the international scene, we had an uncomfortable feeling that we'd lost the respect of friend and foe</ss>
<ss>Some questioned whether we had the will to defend peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>But America is too great for small dreams</ss>
<ss>There was a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival; if you will, a crusade for renewal</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people said: Let us look to the future with confidence, both at home and abroad</ss>
<ss>Let us give freedom a chance</ss>
<ss><NORP> were ready to make a new beginning, and together we have done it</ss>
<ss>We're confronting our problems one by one</ss>
<ss>Hope is alive <TIME> for millions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax increases and crushing inflation</ss>
<ss>Inflation has been beaten down from <PERCENT>, and that's a great victory for all the people</ss>
<ss>The prime rate has been cut almost in half, and we must work together to bring it down even more</ss>
<ss>Together, we passed the <ORDINAL> across-the-board tax reduction for everyone since the <PERSON> tax cuts</ss>
<ss><DATE>, tax rates will be indexed so inflation can't push people into higher brackets when they get cost-of-living pay raises</ss>
<ss>Government must never again use inflation to profit at the people's expense</ss>
<ss><DATE> a working family earning $<MONEY> has $<MONEY> more in purchasing power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the <DATE> levels</ss>
<ss>Real after-tax income increased <PERCENT> <DATE></ss>
<ss>And economic deregulation of key industries like transportation has offered more chances -- or choices, I should say, to consumers and new changes -- or chances for entrepreneurs and protecting safety</ss>
<ss><TIME>, we can report and be proud of one of the best recoveries in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Send away the handwringers and the doubting Thomases</ss>
<ss>Hope is reborn for couples dreaming of owning homes and for risktakers with vision to create <DATE>'s opportunities</ss>
<ss>The spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of high-tech and by small business people with big ideas -- people like <PERSON>, who rose from a ghetto to build a <MONEY> advertising agency in Chicago; <PERSON>, a <NORP> refugee, who turned $<MONEY> and a dream into a successful importing business in Coral Gables, Florida</ss>
<ss>People like these are heroes for <DATE></ss>
<ss>They helped four million <NORP> find jobs in <DATE></ss>
<ss>More people are drawing paychecks <TIME> than ever before</ss>
<ss>And <ORG> helps -- or progress helps everyone -- well, <ORG> does too --  -- everyone</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> women filled <PERCENT> of all the new jobs in managerial, professional, and technical fields</ss>
<ss>But we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work, wondering what will come of their hopes and dreams</ss>
<ss>Can we love America and not reach out to tell them: You are not forgotten; we will not rest until each of you can reach as high as your <PERSON>-given talents will take you</ss>
<ss>The heart of America is strong; it's good and true</ss>
<ss>The cynics were wrong; America never was a sick society</ss>
<ss>We're seeing rededication to bedrock values of faith, family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom -- values that help bring us together as one people, from the youngest child to the most senior citizen</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> deserves America's thanks for helping us restore pride and credibility to our military</ss>
<ss>And I hope that you're as proud as I am of the young men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the ramparts in defense of freedom and whose dedication, valor, and skill increases so much our chance of living in a world at peace</ss>
<ss>People everywhere hunger for peace and a better life</ss>
<ss>The tide of the future is a freedom tide, and our struggle for democracy cannot and will not be denied</ss>
<ss>This nation champions peace that enshrines liberty, democratic rights, and dignity for every individual</ss>
<ss>America's new strength, confidence, and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity far from our shores</ss>
<ss>A world economic recovery is underway</ss>
<ss>It began here</ss>
<ss>We've journeyed far, but we have much farther to go</ss>
<ss><PERSON> told us <DATE>: "Civilization can not go back; civilization must not stand still</ss>
<ss>We have undertaken new methods</ss>
<ss>It is our task to perfect, to improve, to alter when necessary, but in all cases to go forward</ss>
<ss>" It's time to move forward again, time for America to take freedom's next step</ss>
<ss>Let us unite <TIME> behind four great goals to keep America free, secure, and at peace in <DATE> together</ss>
<ss>We can ensure steady economic growth</ss>
<ss>We can develop America's next frontier</ss>
<ss>We can strengthen our traditional values</ss>
<ss>And we can build a meaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faith that has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom, progress, and hope</ss>
<ss>Doing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity, provide greater security for all, with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination</ss>
<ss>The key to <DATE> is vigorous economic growth, our <ORDINAL> great goal</ss>
<ss>We might well begin with common sense in federal budgeting: government spending no more than government takes in</ss>
<ss>We must bring federal deficits down</ss>
<ss>But how we do that makes all the difference</ss>
<ss>We can begin by limiting the size and scope of government</ss>
<ss>Under the leadership of Vice <PERSON> <PERSON>, we have reduced the growth of federal regulations by <PERCENT> and cut well over <TIME> of government-required paperwork <DATE></ss>
<ss>This will save the public <MONEY> over <DATE></ss>
<ss>The Grace <ORG> has given us some 2,500 recommendations for reducing wasteful spending, and they're being examined throughout the administration</ss>
<ss>Federal spending growth has been cut from <PERCENT> in <DATE> to less than half of that <DATE>, and we have already achieved <MONEY> in budget savings for <DATE> to <DATE></ss>
<ss>But that's only a little more than half of what we sought</ss>
<ss>Government is still spending too large a percentage of the total economy</ss>
<ss>Now, some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by reducing the portion spent on defense</ss>
<ss>This ignores the fact that national defense is solely the responsibility of the federal government; indeed, it is its prime responsibility</ss>
<ss>And yet defense spending is less than a <ORDINAL> of the total budget</ss>
<ss>During <DATE> of <PERSON> <PERSON> and of <DATE> before that, defense was almost half the total budget</ss>
<ss>And then came <DATE> in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree</ss>
<ss>We are just now restoring, through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic forces, our capability to meet our present and future security needs</ss>
<ss>We dare not shirk our responsibility to keep America free, secure, and at peace</ss>
<ss>The last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control</ss>
<ss>But the basis for such spending had been laid in <DATE></ss>
<ss>A pattern of overspending has been in place for <DATE></ss>
<ss>As the national debt grew, we were told not to worry, that we owed it to ourselves</ss>
<ss>Now we know that deficits are a cause for worry</ss>
<ss>But there's a difference of opinion as to whether taxes should be increased, spending cut, or some of both</ss>
<ss>Fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for business and industrial expansion</ss>
<ss>Well, I think that debate is missing an important point</ss>
<ss>Whether government borrows or increases taxes, it will be taking the same amount of money from the private sector, and, either way, that's too much</ss>
<ss>Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on families struggling to pay their bills</ss>
<ss>The root of the problem is that government's share is more than we can afford if we're to have a sound economy</ss>
<ss>We must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth</ss>
<ss>In the budget that I will submit on <DATE>, I will recommend measures that will reduce the deficit over <DATE></ss>
<ss>Many of these will be unfinished business from <DATE> budget</ss>
<ss>Some could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort to address this problem</ss>
<ss>I spoke <DATE> with <PERSON> of the <ORG> O'Neill, <ORG> Majority Leader <PERSON>, <ORG> Minority Leader Byrd, and <ORG> Minority Leader <PERSON></ss>
<ss>I asked them if they would designate congressional representatives to meet with representatives of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan</ss>
<ss>I know it would take a long, hard struggle to agree on a full-scale plan</ss>
<ss>So, what I have proposed is that we <ORDINAL> see if we can agree on a down payment</ss>
<ss>Now, I believe there is basis for such an agreement, one that could reduce the deficits by <MONEY> over <DATE></ss>
<ss>We could focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that are still pending before the <ORG></ss>
<ss>These could be combined with measures to close certain tax loopholes, measures that <ORG> has previously said to be worthy of support</ss>
<ss>In addition, we could examine the possibility of achieving further outlay savings based on the work of <ORG></ss>
<ss>If the congressional leadership is willing, my representatives will be prepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time</ss>
<ss>I would hope the leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop and enact that down payment</ss>
<ss>But a down payment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficit problem</ss>
<ss>It could help us start on the right path</ss>
<ss>Yet, we must do more</ss>
<ss>So, I propose that we begin exploring how together we can make structural reforms to curb the built-in growth of spending</ss>
<ss>I also propose improvements in the budgeting process</ss>
<ss>Some 43 of our 50 states grant their Governors the right to veto individual items in appropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill</ss>
<ss>California is one of those 43 states</ss>
<ss>As Governor, I found this line-item veto was a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending</ss>
<ss>It works in 43 states</ss>
<ss>Let's put it to work in Washington for all the people</ss>
<ss>It would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment</ss>
<ss>The majority of <NORP> approve of such an amendment, just as they and I approve of an amendment mandating a balanced federal budget</ss>
<ss>Many states also have this protection in their constitutions</ss>
<ss>To talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a Band-Aid solution which does nothing to cure an illness that's been coming on for <DATE> -- to say nothing of the fact that it poses a real threat to economic recovery</ss>
<ss>Let's remember that a substantial amount of income tax is presently owed and not paid by people in the underground economy</ss>
<ss>It would be immoral to make those who are paying taxes pay more to compensate for those who aren't paying their share</ss>
<ss>There's a better way</ss>
<ss>Let us go forward with an historic reform for fairness, simplicity, and incentives for growth</ss>
<ss>I am asking Secretary <PERSON> for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so all taxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly</ss>
<ss>And I believe such a plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the sunlight of honest tax compliance</ss>
<ss>And it could make the tax base broader, so personal tax rates could come down, not go up</ss>
<ss>I've asked that specific recommendations, consistent with those objectives, be presented to me by <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our <ORDINAL> great goal is to build on America's pioneer spirit --  -- I said something funny?  I said America's next frontier -- and that's to develop that frontier</ss>
<ss>A sparkling economy spurs initiatives, sunrise industries, and makes older ones more competitive</ss>
<ss>Nowhere is this more important than our next frontier: space</ss>
<ss>Nowhere do we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make life better on <LOC></ss>
<ss>The Space Age is <DATE></ss>
<ss>But already we've pushed civilization forward with our advances in science and technology</ss>
<ss>Opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross new thresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown</ss>
<ss>Our progress in space -- taking giant steps for all mankind -- is a tribute to <NORP> teamwork and excellence</ss>
<ss>Our finest minds in government, industry, and academia have all pulled together</ss>
<ss>And we can be proud to say: We are <ORDINAL>; we are the best; and we are so because we're free</ss>
<ss>America has always been greatest when we dared to be great</ss>
<ss>We can reach for greatness again</ss>
<ss>We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I am directing <ORG> to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within <DATE></ss>
<ss>A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications, in metals, and in lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space</ss>
<ss>We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits</ss>
<ss><ORG> will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals</ss>
<ss>Just as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and <NORP> traders, space holds enormous potential for commerce <DATE></ss>
<ss>The market for space transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it</ss>
<ss>Companies interested in putting payloads into space must have ready access to private sector launch services</ss>
<ss><ORG> will help an expendable launch services industry to get off the ground</ss>
<ss>We'll soon implement a number of executive initiatives, develop proposals to ease regulatory constraints, and, with <ORG>'s help, promote private sector investment in space</ss>
<ss>And as we develop the frontier of space, let us remember our responsibility to preserve our older resources here on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it's common sense</ss>
<ss>Though this is a time of budget constraints, I have requested for <ORG> one of the largest percentage budget increases of any agency</ss>
<ss>We will begin the long, necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a special national resource -- <LOC></ss>
<ss>To reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps, <ORG> will spend <MONEY></ss>
<ss>And I will request a supplemental increase of <MONEY></ss>
<ss>And because the <LAW> law expires in <DATE>, I've asked <PERSON> to develop a proposal for its extension so there'll be additional time to complete this important task</ss>
<ss>On the question of acid rain, which concerns people in many areas of the United States and Canada, I'm proposing a research program that doubles our current funding</ss>
<ss>And we'll take additional action to restore our lakes and develop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid rain</ss>
<ss>We have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources</ss>
<ss>We'll ask the <ORG> for <MONEY> beginning in <DATE> to acquire new park and conservation lands</ss>
<ss><ORG> will encourage careful, selective exploration and production on our vital resources in an Exclusive Economic Zone within the 200-mile limit off our coasts -- but with strict adherence to environmental laws and with fuller state and public participation</ss>
<ss>But our most precious resources, our greatest hope for the future, are the minds and hearts of our people, especially our children</ss>
<ss>We can help them build <DATE> by strengthening our community of shared values</ss>
<ss>This must be our <ORDINAL> great goal</ss>
<ss>For us, faith, work, family, neighborhood, freedom, and peace are not just words; they're expressions of what America means, definitions of what makes us a good and loving people</ss>
<ss>Families stand at the center of our society</ss>
<ss>And every family has a personal stake in promoting excellence in education</ss>
<ss>Excellence does not begin in Washington</ss>
<ss>A 600-percent increase in federal spending on education <DATE> was accompanied by a steady decline in <ORG> scores</ss>
<ss>Excellence must begin in our homes and neighborhood schools, where it's the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child</ss>
<ss>Our children come <ORDINAL>, and that's why I established a bipartisan <ORG> in Education, to help us chart a commonsense course for better education</ss>
<ss>And already, communities are implementing the <ORG>'s recommendations</ss>
<ss>Schools are reporting progress in math and reading skills</ss>
<ss>But we must do more to restore discipline to schools; and we must encourage the teaching of new basics, reward teachers of merit, enforce tougher standards, and put our parents back in charge</ss>
<ss>I will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunities for families and to soften the double payment for those paying public school taxes and private school tuition</ss>
<ss>Our proposal would target assistance to low- and middle-income families</ss>
<ss>Just as more incentives are needed within our schools, greater competition is needed among our schools</ss>
<ss>Without standards and competition, there can be no champions, no records broken, no excellence in education or any other walk of life</ss>
<ss>And while I'm on this subject, <DATE> your members observe a 200-year-old tradition meant to signify America is one nation under <PERSON></ss>
<ss>I must ask: If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge <PERSON> be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land? America was founded by people who believed that <PERSON> was their rock of safety</ss>
<ss>He is ours</ss>
<ss>I recognize we must be cautious in claiming that <PERSON> is on our side, but I think it's all right to keep asking if we're on His side</ss>
<ss>During <DATE>, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore protection of the law to unborn children</ss>
<ss>Now, I know this issue is very controversial</ss>
<ss>But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child is not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof that it isn't? No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the evidence is to the contrary</ss>
<ss>We should rise above bitterness and reproach, and if <NORP> could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping, then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion</ss>
<ss>Economic recovery, better education, rededication to values, all show the spirit of renewal gaining the upper hand</ss>
<ss>And all will improve family life in <DATE></ss>
<ss>But families need more</ss>
<ss>They need assurance that they and their loved ones can walk the streets of America without being afraid</ss>
<ss>Parents need to know their children will not be victims of child pornography and abduction</ss>
<ss><DATE> we will intensify our drive against these and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family violence</ss>
<ss>Already our efforts to crack down on career criminals, organized crime, drugpushers, and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are having effect</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> the crime rate dropped by <PERCENT>, the biggest decline since <DATE></ss>
<ss>Protecting victims is just as important as safeguarding the rights of defendants</ss>
<ss>Opportunities for all <NORP> will increase if we move forward in fair housing and work to ensure women's rights, provide for equitable treatment in pension benefits and <ORG>, facilitate child care, and enforce delinquent parent support payments</ss>
<ss>It's not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our values and shape our future</ss>
<ss>So, I ask your help in assisting more communities to break the bondage of dependency</ss>
<ss>Help us to free enterprise by permitting debate and voting "yes" on our proposal for enterprise zones in America</ss>
<ss>This has been before you for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Its passage can help high-unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods</ss>
<ss>A society bursting with opportunities, reaching for its future with confidence, sustained by faith, fair play, and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when they're free -- these are the secrets of a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world</ss>
<ss>A lasting and meaningful peace is our <ORDINAL> great goal</ss>
<ss>It is our highest aspiration</ss>
<ss>And our record is clear: <NORP> resort to force only when we must</ss>
<ss>We have never been aggressors</ss>
<ss>We have always struggled to defend freedom and democracy</ss>
<ss>We have no territorial ambitions</ss>
<ss>We occupy no countries</ss>
<ss>We build no walls to lock people in</ss>
<ss><NORP> build the future</ss>
<ss>And our vision of a better life for farmers, merchants, and working people, from the <LOC> to <LOC>, begins with a simple premise: The future is best decided by ballots, not bullets</ss>
<ss>Governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war on their neighbors</ss>
<ss>Only when people are given a personal stake in deciding their own destiny, benefiting from their own risks, do they create societies that are prosperous, progressive, and free</ss>
<ss><TIME>, it is democracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry, prolonging life, and eliminating drudgery</ss>
<ss>When it comes to keeping America strong, free, and at peace, there should be no <NORP> or <NORP>, just patriotic <NORP></ss>
<ss>We can decide the tough issues not by who is right, but by what is right</ss>
<ss>Together, we can continue to advance our agenda for peace</ss>
<ss>We can establish a more stable basis for peaceful relations with the <NORP> <ORG>; strengthen allied relations across the board; achieve real and equitable reductions in the levels of nuclear arms; reinforce our peacemaking efforts in <LOC>, <LOC>, and southern <LOC>; or assist developing countries, particularly our neighbors in <LOC>; and assist in the development of democratic institutions throughout the world</ss>
<ss>The wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of <ORG>, which strengthened our ability to deter war and protect peace</ss>
<ss>In that same spirit, I urge you to move forward with the <PERSON> plan to implement the recommendations of <ORG> on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon is also serving the cause of peace</ss>
<ss>We are making progress in Lebanon</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, the <NORP> have lived from tragedy to tragedy with no hope for their future</ss>
<ss>Now the multinational peacekeeping force and our <NORP> are helping them break their cycle of despair</ss>
<ss>There is hope for a free, independent, and sovereign Lebanon</ss>
<ss>We must have the courage to give peace a chance</ss>
<ss>And we must not be driven from our objectives for peace in Lebanon by state-sponsored terrorism</ss>
<ss>We have seen this ugly specter in Beirut, Kuwait, and <PERSON></ss>
<ss>It demands international attention</ss>
<ss>I will forward shortly legislative proposals to help combat terrorism</ss>
<ss>And I will be seeking support from our allies for concerted action</ss>
<ss>Our <ORG> alliance is strong</ss>
<ss><DATE> was <DATE> for political courage</ss>
<ss>And we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships in <LOC></ss>
<ss>We're committed to dialog, deterrence, and promoting prosperity</ss>
<ss>We'll work with our trading partners for a new round of negotiations in support of freer world trade, greater competition, and more open markets</ss>
<ss>A rebirth of bipartisan cooperation, of economic growth, and military deterrence, and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and our allies abroad underline a fundamental and far-reaching change: The United States is safer, stronger, and more secure in <DATE> than before</ss>
<ss>We can now move with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace, and we will</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I want to speak to the people of the <NORP> <ORG>, to tell them it's true that our governments have had serious differences, but our sons and daughters have never fought each other in war</ss>
<ss>And if we <NORP> have our way, they never will</ss>
<ss>People of the <NORP> <ORG>, there is only one sane policy, for your country and mine, to preserve our civilization in this modern age: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought</ss>
<ss>The only value in our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used</ss>
<ss>But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely? People of the <NORP>, <PERSON> <PERSON>, who fought by your side in <EVENT>, said the essential struggle "is not merely man against man or nation against nation</ss>
<ss>It is man against war</ss>
<ss>" <NORP> are people of peace</ss>
<ss>If your government wants peace, there will be peace</ss>
<ss>We can come together in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world for our children and our children's children</ss>
<ss>And the whole world will rejoice</ss>
<ss>That is my message to you</ss>
<ss>Some <DATE> when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us or a friend to help us, we find a person who reminds us what it means to be <NORP></ss>
<ss>Sergeant <PERSON>, a medic in the <DATE> Ranger Battalion, <ORG>, was in the <ORDINAL> helicopter to land at the compound held by <NORP> forces in Grenada</ss>
<ss>He saw three other helicopters crash</ss>
<ss>Despite the imminent explosion of the burning aircraft, he never hesitated</ss>
<ss>He ran across <QUANTITY> of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers</ss>
<ss>He directed two other medics, administered <ORDINAL> aid, and returned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends to safety</ss>
<ss>Sergeant Trujillo, you and your fellow service men and women not only saved innocent lives; you set a nation free</ss>
<ss>You inspire us as a force for freedom, not for despotism; and, yes, for peace, not conquest</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss>And then there are unsung heroes: single parents, couples, church and civic volunteers</ss>
<ss>Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family and community problems</ss>
<ss>They soothe our sorrow, heal our wounds, calm our fears, and share our joy</ss>
<ss>A person like Father <PERSON> is always there</ss>
<ss>His <ORG> programs in New York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightened and abused children <DATE></ss>
<ss>The same is true of Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>Paralyzed in a plane crash, he still believed nothing is impossible</ss>
<ss><DATE> in Minnesota, he works <TIME> a week without pay, helping pioneer the field of computer-controlled walking</ss>
<ss>He has given hope to 500,000 paralyzed <NORP> that <DATE> they may walk again</ss>
<ss>How can we not believe in the greatness of America? How can we not do what is right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on <LOC>? After all our struggles to restore America, to revive confidence in our country, hope for our future, after all our hard-won victories earned through the patience and courage of every citizen, we cannot, must not, and will not turn back</ss>
<ss>We will finish our job</ss>
<ss>How could we do less? We're <NORP></ss>
<ss><PERSON> said, "I see America not in the setting sun of <TIME> of despair</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun fresh from the burning, creative hand of <PERSON></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>I see great <DATE> ahead for men and women of will and vision</ss>
<ss>" I've never felt more strongly that America's <DATE> and democracy's <DATE> lie ahead</ss>
<ss>We're a powerful force for good</ss>
<ss>With faith and courage, we can perform great deeds and take freedom's next step</ss>
<ss>And we will</ss>
<ss>We will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light where there was darkness, warmth where there was cold, medicine where there was disease, food where there was hunger, and peace where there was only bloodshed</ss>
<ss>Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, that in our time we did everything that could be done</ss>
<ss>We finished the race; we kept them free; we kept the faith</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss>In the business that I formerly was in, I would have to say this is a very difficult spot -- to be introduced to you who have waited so patiently -- following this wonderful talent that we've seen here</ss>
<ss>And I should have gone on <ORDINAL>, and then you should have followed --  -- to close the show</ss>
<ss>But thank you very much</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I are most grateful to be with you here <DATE>, and I'll take a chance and say, <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Did I get it right?  All right</ss>
<ss>Well, it's difficult to express my appreciation to all of you</ss>
<ss>I feel like I'm about to drown everyone in a bath of nostalgia</ss>
<ss>Of all the honors and gifts that have been afforded me as President, this visit is the one that I will cherish dearly</ss>
<ss>You see, I didn't know much about my family background-not because of a lack of interest, but because my father was orphaned before he was <DATE></ss>
<ss>And now thanks to you and the efforts of good people who have dug into the history of a poor immigrant family, I know at last whence I came</ss>
<ss>And this has given my soul a new contentment</ss>
<ss>And it is a joyous feeling</ss>
<ss>It is like coming home after a long journey</ss>
<ss>You see, my father, having been orphaned so young, he knew nothing of his roots also</ss>
<ss>And, <PERSON> rest his soul, I told the Father, I think he's here, too, <DATE>, and very pleased and happy to know that this is whence he came</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, a renowned <NORP> poet, once said, "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in</ss>
<ss>"  Well, it's been so long since my great-grandfather set out that you don't have to take me in</ss>
<ss>So, I'm certainly thankful for this wonderful homecoming <DATE></ss>
<ss>I can't think of a place on the planet I would rather claim as my roots more than <LOC>, County <ORG></ss>
<ss>My great-grandfather left here in a time of stress, seeking to better himself and his family</ss>
<ss>From what I'm told, we were a poor family</ss>
<ss>But my ancestors took with them a treasure, an indomitable spirit that was cultivated in the rich soil of this county</ss>
<ss>And <DATE> I come back to you as a descendant of people who are buried here in paupers' graves</ss>
<ss>Perhaps this is <PERSON>'s way of reminding us that we must always treat every individual, no matter what his or her station in life, with dignity and respect</ss>
<ss>And who knows? Someday that person's child or grandchild might grow up to become the Prime Minister of Ireland or President of the United States</ss>
<ss>Looking around town <DATE>, I was struck by the similarity between <LOC> and the small town in Illinois where I was born, <ORG></ss>
<ss>Of course, there's one thing you have that we didn't have in <ORG></ss>
<ss>We didn't have a <PERSON> in town</ss>
<ss>Well, the spirit is the same, this spirit of warmth, friendliness, and openness in <ORG> and <LOC>, and you make me feel very much at home</ss>
<ss>What unites us is our shared heritage and the common values of our two peoples</ss>
<ss>So many <NORP> men and women from every walk of life played a role in creating the dream of America</ss>
<ss>One was <PERSON>, Secretary of <ORG>, and who designed the <ORDINAL> Great Seal of the United States</ss>
<ss>I'm certainly proud to be part of that great <NORP> tradition</ss>
<ss>From the time of our revolution when <NORP>men filled the ranks of <ORG>, to the building of the railroads, to the cultural contributions of individuals like the magnificent tenor <PERSON> and the athletic achievements of the great heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> -- all of them are part of a great legacy</ss>
<ss>Speaking of sports, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate an organization of which all <NORP> men and women can be proud, an organization that <DATE> is celebrating its <ORDINAL> anniversary: <ORG></ss>
<ss>I understand it was formed <DATE> in <ORG> to foster the culture and games of traditional Ireland</ss>
<ss>Some of you may be aware that I began my career as a sports announcer -- a sports broadcaster, so I had an early appreciation for sporting competition</ss>
<ss>Well, congratulations to all of you during this <ORG> centennial celebration</ss>
<ss>I also understand that not too far from here is the home of the great <NORP> novelist <PERSON></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> identity flourished in the United States</ss>
<ss><NORP> men and women proud of their heritage can be found in every walk of life</ss>
<ss>I even have some of them in my <ORG></ss>
<ss>One of them traces his maternal roots to Mitchellstown, just down the road from <LOC></ss>
<ss>And he and I have almost the same name</ss>
<ss>I'm talking about Secretary of the Treasury <PERSON></ss>
<ss>He spells it R-e-g-a-n</ss>
<ss>We're all of the same clan, we're all cousins</ss>
<ss>I tried to tell the Secretary <DATE> that his branch of the family spelled it that way because they just couldn't handle as many letters as ours could</ss>
<ss>And then I received a paper from Ireland that told me that the clan to which we belong, that in it those who said "<PERSON>" and spelled it that way were the professional people and the educators, and only the common laborers called it "<PERSON></ss>
<ss>"  So, meet a common laborer</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> job I ever got -- I was <DATE>, and they put a pick and a shovel in my hand and my father told me that that was fitting and becoming to one of our name</ss>
<ss>The bond between our two countries runs deep and strong, and I'm proud to be here in recognition and celebration of our ties that bind</ss>
<ss>My roots in <LOC>, County <ORG>, are little different than millions of other <NORP> who find their roots in towns and counties all over <LOC></ss>
<ss>I just feel exceptionally lucky to have this chance to visit you</ss>
<ss><DATE> a member of my staff came through town and recorded some messages from you</ss>
<ss>It was quite a tape, and I was moved deeply by the sentiments that you expressed</ss>
<ss>One of your townsmen sang me a bit of a tune about <PERSON>, and a few lines stuck in my mind</ss>
<ss>They went like this -- not that I'll sing -- "And I'll never more roam, from my own native home, in <ORG> so far away</ss>
<ss>" Well, the <NORP> roamed to America, but now we're back</ss>
<ss>And <PERSON> and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for coming out to welcome us, for the warmth of your welcome</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you all</ss>
<ss>In the business that I formerly was in, I would have to say this is a very difficult spot -- to be introduced to you who have waited so patiently -- following this wonderful talent that we've seen here</ss>

<ss><PERSON> bless you all</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>We're here to mark <DATE> in history when the <ORG> armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, much of <LOC> had been under a terrible shadow</ss>
<ss>Free nations had fallen, <NORP> cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation</ss>
<ss><LOC> was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue</ss>
<ss>Here in <ORG> the rescue began</ss>
<ss>Here the <ORG> stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history</ss>
<ss>We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France</ss>
<ss>The air is soft, but <DATE> at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon</ss>
<ss>At dawn, on <TIME> of the 6th of June, 1944, 225 <ORG> jumped off the <NORP> landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs</ss>
<ss>Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the <ORG> advance</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machineguns and throwing grenades</ss>
<ss>And <ORG> began to climb</ss>
<ss>They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up</ss>
<ss>When one <PRODUCT> fell, another would take his place</ss>
<ss>When one rope was cut, a <PRODUCT> would grab another and begin his climb again</ss>
<ss>They climbed, shot back, and held their footing</ss>
<ss>Soon, one by one, the <ORG> pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of <LOC></ss>
<ss>Two hundred and twenty-five came here</ss>
<ss>After <DATE> of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms</ss>
<ss>Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the <PRODUCT> daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs</ss>
<ss>And before me are the men who put them there</ss>
<ss>These are the boys of <FAC></ss>
<ss>These are the men who took the cliffs</ss>
<ss>These are the champions who helped free a continent</ss>
<ss>These are the heroes who helped end a war</ss>
<ss>Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of <PERSON> poem</ss>
<ss>You are men who in your "lives fought for life</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>and left the vivid air signed with your honor</ss>
<ss>" I think I know what you may be thinking right now -- thinking "we were just part of a bigger effort; everyone was brave <DATE></ss>
<ss>" Well, everyone was</ss>
<ss>Do you remember the story of <PERSON> of <ORG>? <DATE> <DATE>, <NORP> troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help</ss>
<ss>Suddenly, they heard the sound of bagpipes, and some thought they were dreaming</ss>
<ss>Well, they weren't</ss>
<ss>They looked up and saw <PERSON> with his bagpipes, leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the bullets into the ground around him</ss>
<ss>Lord Lovat was with him -- Lord Lovat of Scotland, who calmly announced when he got to the bridge, " -- Sorry I'm <TIME> late," as if he'd been delayed by a traffic jam, when in truth he'd just come from the bloody fighting on Sword Beach, which he and his men had just taken</ss>
<ss>There was the impossible valor of the <NORP> who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of <LOC> as the invasion took hold, and the unsurpassed courage of the <NORP> who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast</ss>
<ss>They knew what awaited them there, but they would not be deterred</ss>
<ss>And once they hit Juno Beach, they never looked back</ss>
<ss>All of these men were part of a rollcall of honor with names that spoke of a pride as bright as the colors they bore: <ORG>, Poland's <ORDINAL> Lancers, <ORG>, <ORG>, <ORG> armored divisions, the forces of Free France, <ORG> "<WORK_OF_ART>" and you, <ORG></ss>
<ss>Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here</ss>
<ss>You were young <DATE> you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you</ss>
<ss>Yet, you risked everything here</ss>
<ss>Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer</ss>
<ss>It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love</ss>
<ss>The men of <ORG> had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next</ss>
<ss>It was the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that there is a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest</ss>
<ss>You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause</ss>
<ss>And you were right not to doubt</ss>
<ss>You all knew that some things are worth dying for</ss>
<ss>One's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man</ss>
<ss>All of you loved liberty</ss>
<ss>All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> who fought here <TIME> knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home</ss>
<ss>They fought -- or felt in their hearts, though they couldn't know in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at <DATE>, in Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying, and in Philadelphia they were ringing <ORG></ss>
<ss>Something else helped the men of <DATE>: their rockhard belief that <NORP> would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here; that God was an ally in this great cause</ss>
<ss>And so, <TIME> before the invasion, when Colonel <PERSON> asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer he told them: "Do not bow your heads, but look up so you can see God and ask His blessing in what we're about to do</ss>
<ss>" Also <TIME>, General <PERSON> on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to <PERSON>: "I will not fail thee nor forsake thee</ss>
<ss>" These are the things that impelled them; these are the things that shaped the unity of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>When the war was over, there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the people</ss>
<ss>There were nations to be reborn</ss>
<ss>Above all, there was a new peace to be assured</ss>
<ss>These were huge and daunting tasks</ss>
<ss>But the <ORG> summoned strength from the faith, belief, loyalty, and love of those who fell here</ss>
<ss>They rebuilt a new <LOC> together</ss>
<ss>There was <ORDINAL> a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies, all of whom had suffered so greatly</ss>
<ss>The United States did its part, creating the <PERSON> plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies</ss>
<ss>The <PERSON> plan led to the <LOC> alliance -- a great alliance that serves to <DATE> as our shield for freedom, for prosperity, and for peace</ss>
<ss>In spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed the end of the war was happy or planned</ss>
<ss>Some liberated countries were lost</ss>
<ss>The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time in the streets of Warsaw, Prague, and East Berlin</ss>
<ss><NORP> troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came</ss>
<ss>They're still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, <DATE> after the war</ss>
<ss>Because of this, allied forces still stand on this continent</ss>
<ss><DATE>, as <DATE>, our armies are here for only one purpose -- to protect and defend democracy</ss>
<ss>The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest</ss>
<ss>We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost</ss>
<ss>We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent</ss>
<ss>But we try always to be prepared for peace; prepared to deter aggression; prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms; and, yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation</ss>
<ss>In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the <NORP> Union, so, together, we can lessen the risks of war, now and forever</ss>
<ss>It's fitting to remember here the great losses also suffered by the <NORP> people during <EVENT>: 20 million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world the necessity of ending war</ss>
<ss>I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war</ss>
<ss>We want to wipe from the face of the <LOC> the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands</ss>
<ss>And I tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead</ss>
<ss>We look for some sign from the <NORP> Union that they are willing to move forward, that they share our desire and love for peace, and that they will give up the ways of conquest</ss>
<ss>There must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action</ss>
<ss>We will pray forever that <DATE> that changing will come</ss>
<ss>But for now, particularly <DATE>, it is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other, to our freedom, and to the alliance that protects it</ss>
<ss>We are bound <DATE> by what bound us <DATE>, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs</ss>
<ss>We're bound by reality</ss>
<ss>The strength of America's allies is vital to the United States, and the <NORP> security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of <LOC>'s democracies</ss>
<ss>We were with you then; we are with you now</ss>
<ss>Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny</ss>
<ss>Here, in this place where the <LOC> held together, let us make a vow to our dead</ss>
<ss>Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for</ss>
<ss>Let our actions say to them the words for which <PERSON> listened: "I will not fail thee nor forsake thee</ss>
<ss>" Strengthened by their courage, heartened by their value , and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much, and God bless you all</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss>Vice President, delegates to this convention, and fellow citizens: In <DATE>, I hope we enjoy a victory that is the size of the heart of Texas</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I extend our deep thanks to <ORG> and the "Big D" -- the city of Dallas -- for all their warmth and hospitality</ss>
<ss><DATE> I didn't know precisely every duty of this office, and not too long ago, I learned about some new ones from the <ORDINAL> graders of <ORG> in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania</ss>
<ss>Little <PERSON> was asked by her teacher to describe my duties</ss>
<ss>She said: "The President goes to meetings</ss>
<ss>He helps the animals</ss>
<ss>The President gets frustrated</ss>
<ss>He talks to other Presidents</ss>
<ss>" How does wisdom begin at such an early age? <TIME>, with a full heart and deep gratitude for your trust, I accept your nomination for the Presidency of the United States</ss>
<ss>I will campaign on behalf of the principles of our party which lift America confidently into the future</ss>
<ss>America is presented with the clearest political choice of <DATE></ss>
<ss>The distinction between our two parties and the different philosophy of our political opponents are at the heart of this campaign and America's future</ss>
<ss>I've been campaigning long enough to know that a political party and its leadership can't change their colors in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We won't, and no matter how hard they tried, our opponents didn't in San Francisco</ss>
<ss>We didn't discover our values in a poll taken <DATE> before the convention</ss>
<ss>And we didn't set a weathervane on top of <FAC> before we started talking about the <NORP> family</ss>
<ss>The choices <DATE> are not just between two different personalities or between two political parties</ss>
<ss>They're between two different visions of the future, two fundamentally different ways of governing -- their government of pessimism, fear, and limits, or ours of hope, confidence, and growth</ss>
<ss>Their government sees people only as members of groups; ours serves all the people of America as individuals</ss>
<ss>Theirs lives in the past, seeking to apply the old and failed policies to an era that has passed them by</ss>
<ss>Ours learns from the past and strives to change by boldly charting a new course for the future</ss>
<ss>Theirs lives by promises, the bigger, the better</ss>
<ss>We offer proven, workable answers</ss>
<ss>Our opponents began this campaign hoping that America has a poor memory</ss>
<ss>Well, let's take them on a little stroll down memory lane</ss>
<ss>Let's remind them of how a 4</ss>
<ss>8-percent inflation rate in <DATE> became back-to-back years of double-digit inflation -- the worst since <EVENT> -- punishing the poor and the elderly, young couples striving to start their new lives, and working people struggling to make ends meet</ss>
<ss>Inflation was not some plague borne on the wind; it was a deliberate part of their official economic policy, needed, they said, to maintain prosperity</ss>
<ss>They didn't tell us that with it would come the highest interest rates since <EVENT></ss>
<ss>As average <DATE> mortgage payments more than doubled, home building nearly ground to a halt; tens of thousands of carpenters and others were thrown out of work</ss>
<ss>And who controlled both <ORG>s of the <ORG> and the executive branch at that time? Not us, not us</ss>
<ss>Campaigning across America in <DATE>, we saw evidence everywhere of industrial decline</ss>
<ss>And in rural America, farmers' costs were driven up by inflation</ss>
<ss>They were devastated by a wrongheaded grain embargo and were forced to borrow money at exorbitant interest rates just to get by</ss>
<ss>And many of them didn't get by</ss>
<ss><ORG> have to fight insects, weather, and the marketplace; they shouldn't have to fight their own government</ss>
<ss>The high interest rates of <DATE> were not talked about in San Francisco</ss>
<ss>But how about taxes? They were talked about in San Francisco</ss>
<ss>Will <ORG> once said he never met a man he didn't like</ss>
<ss>Well, if I could paraphrase Will, our friends in the other party have never met a tax they didn't like or hike</ss>
<ss>Under their policies, tax rates have gone up three times as much for families with children as they have for everyone else over <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> before we came into office, taxes roughly doubled</ss>
<ss>Some who spoke so loudly in San Francisco of fairness were among those who brought about the biggest single, individual tax increase in our history in <DATE>, calling for a series of increases in the <ORG> payroll tax and in the amount of pay subject to that tax</ss>
<ss>The bill they passed called for two additional increases <DATE>, increases that bear down hardest on those at the lower income levels</ss>
<ss>The Census Bureau confirms that, because of the tax laws we inherited, the number of households at or below the poverty level paying federal income tax more than doubled <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, they received some relief in <DATE>, when our across-the-board tax cut was fully in place</ss>
<ss>And they'll get more help when indexing goes into effect <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our opponents have repeatedly advocated eliminating indexing</ss>
<ss>Would that really hurt the rich? No, because the rich are already in the top brackets</ss>
<ss>But those working men and women who depend on a cost-of-living adjustment just to keep abreast of inflation would find themselves pushed into higher tax brackets and wouldn't even be able to keep even with inflation because they'd be paying a higher income tax</ss>
<ss>That's bracket creep; and our opponents are for it, and we're against it</ss>
<ss>It's up to us to see that all our fellow citizens understand that confiscatory taxes, costly social experiments, and economic tinkering were not just the policies of a single administration</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> prior to <DATE>, the opposition party controlled both <ORG>s of <ORG></ss>
<ss>Every spending bill and every tax for <DATE> has been of their doing</ss>
<ss><DATE>, they said federal spending was out of control, so they passed a budget control act and, in <DATE>, ran up deficits of <MONEY></ss>
<ss>Some control</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> we gained control of the <ORG> and the executive branch</ss>
<ss>With the help of some concerned <NORP> in the <ORG> we started a policy of tightening the federal budget instead of the family budget</ss>
<ss>A task force chaired by Vice President <PERSON> -- the finest Vice President this country has ever had -- it eliminated unnecessary regulations that had been strangling business and industry</ss>
<ss>And while we have our friends down memory lane, maybe they'd like to recall a gimmick they designed for their <DATE> campaign</ss>
<ss>As President <PERSON> told us <TIME> before last, adding the unemployment and inflation rates, they got what they called a misery index</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> it came to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>They declared the incumbent had no right to seek reelection with that kind of a misery index</ss>
<ss>Well, <DATE>, in the <DATE> election, they didn't mention the misery index, possibly because it was then <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>And do you know something? They won't mention it in this election either</ss>
<ss>It's down to 11</ss>
<ss>6 and dropping</ss>
<ss>By nearly every measure, the position of poor <NORP> worsened under the leadership of our opponents</ss>
<ss>Teenage drug use, out-of-wedlock births, and crime increased dramatically</ss>
<ss>Urban neighborhoods and schools deteriorated</ss>
<ss>Those whom government intended to help discovered a cycle of dependency that could not be broken</ss>
<ss>Government became a drug, providing temporary relief, but addiction as well</ss>
<ss>And let's get some facts on the table that our opponents don't want to hear</ss>
<ss>The biggest <DATE> increase in poverty took place <DATE> -- <PERCENT> each year, in <DATE> of our administration</ss>
<ss>Well, I should -- pardon me -- I didn't put a period in there</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> of our administration, that <DATE> increase fell to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>And <DATE> was <DATE> since <DATE> that there was no appreciable increase in poverty at all</ss>
<ss>Pouring <MONEY> into programs in order to make people worse off was irrational and unfair</ss>
<ss>It was time we ended this reliance on the government process and renewed our faith in the human process</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> the people decided with us that the economic crisis was not caused by the fact that they lived too well</ss>
<ss>Government lived too well</ss>
<ss>It was time for tax increases to be an act of last resort, not of <ORDINAL> resort</ss>
<ss>The people told the liberal leadership in Washington, "Try shrinking the size of government before you shrink the size of our paychecks</ss>
<ss>" Our government was also in serious trouble abroad</ss>
<ss>We had aircraft that couldn't fly and ships that couldn't leave port</ss>
<ss>Many of our military were on food stamps because of meager earnings, and reenlistments were down</ss>
<ss>Ammunition was low, and spare parts were in short supply</ss>
<ss>Many of our allies mistrusted us</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> before we took office, country after country fell under the <NORP> yoke</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE>, not <QUANTITY> of soil has fallen to the <NORP></ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>But worst of all, <NORP> were losing the confidence and optimism about the future that has made us unique in the world</ss>
<ss>Parents were beginning to doubt that their children would have the better life that has been the dream of every <NORP> generation</ss>
<ss>We can all be proud that pessimism is ended</ss>
<ss>America is coming back and is more confident than ever about the future</ss>
<ss><TIME>, we thank the citizens of the United States whose faith and unwillingness to give up on themselves or this country saved us all</ss>
<ss>Together, we began the task of controlling the size and activities of the government by reducing the growth of its spending while passing a tax program to provide incentives to increase productivity for both workers and industry</ss>
<ss><DATE>, a working family earning $<MONEY> has <MONEY> more in purchasing power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the <DATE> level</ss>
<ss><DATE>, of all the major industrial nations of the world, America has the strongest economic growth; one of the lowest inflation rates; the fastest rate of job creation -- <DATE> million jobs in <DATE> -- a record 600,000 business incorporations in <DATE>; and the largest increase in real, after-tax personal income since <EVENT></ss>
<ss>We're enjoying the highest level of business investment in history, and America has renewed its leadership in developing the vast new opportunities in science and high technology</ss>
<ss>America is on the move again and expanding toward new eras of opportunity for everyone</ss>
<ss>Now, we're accused of having a secret</ss>
<ss>Well, if we have, it is that we're going to keep the mighty engine of this nation revved up</ss>
<ss>And that means a future of sustained economic growth without inflation that's going to create for our children and grandchildren a prosperity that finally will last</ss>
<ss><DATE> our troops have newer and better equipment; their morale is higher</ss>
<ss>The better armed they are, the less likely it is they will have to use that equipment</ss>
<ss>But if, heaven forbid, they're ever called upon to defend this nation, nothing would be more immoral than asking them to do so with weapons inferior to those of any possible opponent</ss>
<ss>We have also begun to repair our valuable alliances, especially our historic <ORG> alliance</ss>
<ss>Extensive discussions in <LOC> have enabled us to start a new round of diplomatic progress there</ss>
<ss>In <LOC>, it remains difficult to bring an end to historic conflicts, but we're not discouraged</ss>
<ss>And we shall always maintain our pledge never to sell out one of our closest friends, the State of Israel</ss>
<ss>Closer to home, there remains a struggle for survival for free <NORP> States, allies of ours</ss>
<ss>They valiantly struggle to prevent <NORP> takeovers fueled massively by the <NORP> Union and Cuba</ss>
<ss>Our policy is simple: We are not going to betray our friends, reward the enemies of freedom, or permit fear and retreat to become <NORP> policies -- especially in this hemisphere</ss>
<ss>None of the four wars in my lifetime came about because we were too strong</ss>
<ss>It's weakness that invites adventurous adversaries to make mistaken judgments</ss>
<ss>America is the most peaceful, least warlike nation in modern history</ss>
<ss>We are not the cause of all the ills of the world</ss>
<ss>We're a patient and generous people</ss>
<ss>But for the sake of our freedom and that of others, we cannot permit our reserve to be confused with a lack of resolve</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we displayed this resolve in a mission to rescue <NORP> students on the imprisoned island of Grenada</ss>
<ss><NORP> candidates have suggested that this could be likened to the <NORP> invasion of Afghanistan -- the crushing of human rights in Poland or the genocide in Cambodia</ss>
<ss>Could you imagine <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, or <PERSON> making such a shocking comparison? Nineteen of our fine young men lost their lives on Grenada, and to even remotely compare their sacrifice to the murderous actions taking place in Afghanistan is unconscionable</ss>
<ss>There are some obvious and important differences</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we were invited in by six <LOC></ss>
<ss>Does anyone seriously believe the people of <LOC> or Afghanistan invited the <NORP>? Second, there are hundreds of thousands of <NORP> occupying captive nations across the world</ss>
<ss><DATE>, our combat troops have come home</ss>
<ss>Our students are safe, and freedom is what we left behind in Grenada</ss>
<ss>There are some who've forgotten why we have a military</ss>
<ss>It's not to promote war; it's to be prepared for peace</ss>
<ss>There's a sign over the entrance to <FAC> in Washington State, and that sign says it all: "Peace is our profession</ss>
<ss>" Our next administration -- -- All right</ss>
<ss>I heard you</ss>
<ss>And that administration will be committed to completing the unfinished agenda that we've placed before the <ORG> and the nation</ss>
<ss>It is an agenda which calls upon the national <NORP> leadership to cease its obstructionist ways</ss>
<ss>We've heard a lot about deficits <DATE> from those on the other side of the aisle</ss>
<ss>Well, they should be experts on budget deficits</ss>
<ss>They've spent most of their political careers creating deficits</ss>
<ss>For 42 of <DATE>, they have controlled both <ORG>s of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>And for almost all of <DATE>, deficit spending has been their deliberate policy</ss>
<ss>Now, however, they call for an end to deficits</ss>
<ss>They call them ours</ss>
<ss>Yet, at the same time, the leadership of their party resists our every effort to bring federal spending under control</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> straight, they have prevented us from adopting a balanced budget amendment to the <PRODUCT></ss>
<ss>We will continue to fight for that amendment, mandating that government spend no more than government takes in</ss>
<ss>And we will fight, as the Vice President told you, for the right of a President to veto items in appropriations bills without having to veto the entire bill</ss>
<ss>There is no better way than the line-item veto, now used by <ORG> in 43 states to cut out waste in government</ss>
<ss>I know</ss>
<ss>As Governor of California, I successfully made such vetos over 900 times</ss>
<ss>Now, their candidate, it would appear, has only recently found deficits alarming</ss>
<ss><DATE> he insisted that a <MONEY> deficit should be allowed to get much bigger in order to lower unemployment, and he said that sometimes "we need a deficit in order to stimulate the economy</ss>
<ss>" As a Senator, he voted to override President <PERSON>'s veto of <MONEY> in spending bills and then voted no on a proposal to cut the <DATE> deficit in half</ss>
<ss>Was anyone surprised by his pledge to raise your taxes <DATE> if given the chance? In the <ORG>, he voted time and again for new taxes, including a 10-percent income tax surcharge, higher taxes on certain consumer items</ss>
<ss>He also voted against cutting the excise tax on automobiles</ss>
<ss>And he was part and parcel of that biggest single, individual tax increase in history -- the <ORG> payroll tax of <DATE></ss>
<ss>It tripled the maximum tax and still didn't make the system solvent</ss>
<ss>If our opponents were as vigorous in supporting our voluntary prayer amendment as they are in raising taxes, maybe we could get the Lord back in the schoolrooms and drugs and violence out</ss>
<ss>Something else illustrates the nature of the choice <NORP> must make</ss>
<ss>While we've been hearing a lot of tough talk on crime from our opponents, the <ORG> <NORP> leadership continues to block a critical anticrime bill that passed <ORG> by a 91-to-1 vote</ss>
<ss>Their burial of this bill means that you and your families will have to wait for even safer homes and streets</ss>
<ss>There's no longer any good reason to hold back passage of tuition tax credit legislation</ss>
<ss>Millions of average parents pay their full share of taxes to support public schools while choosing to send their children to parochial or other independent schools</ss>
<ss>Doesn't fairness dictate that they should have some help in carrying a double burden? When we talk of the plight of our cities, what would help more than our enterprise zones bill, which provides tax incentives for private industry to help rebuild and restore decayed areas in 75 sites all across America? If they really wanted a future of boundless new opportunities for our citizens, why have they buried enterprise zones over <DATE> in committee? Our opponents are openly committed to increasing our tax burden</ss>
<ss>We are committed to stopping them, and we will</ss>
<ss>They call their policy the new realism, but their new realism is just the old liberalism</ss>
<ss>They will place higher and higher taxes on small businesses, on family farms, and on other working families so that government may once again grow at the people's expense</ss>
<ss>You know, we could say they spend money like drunken sailors, but that would be unfair to drunken sailors --  --  All right</ss>
<ss>I agree</ss>
<ss>I was going to say, it would be unfair, because the sailors are spending their own money</ss>
<ss>Our tax policies are and will remain prowork, progrowth, and profamily</ss>
<ss>We intend to simplify the entire tax system -- to make taxes more fair, easier to understand, and, most important, to bring the tax rates of every <NORP> further down, not up</ss>
<ss>Now, if we bring them down far enough, growth will continue strong; the underground economy will shrink; the world will beat a path to our door; and no one will be able to hold America back; and the future will be ours</ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>Another part of our future, the greatest challenge of all, is to reduce the risk of nuclear war by reducing the levels of nuclear arms</ss>
<ss>I have addressed parliaments, have spoken to parliaments in <LOC> and <LOC> during <DATE>, declaring that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought</ss>
<ss>And those words, in those assemblies, were greeted with spontaneous applause</ss>
<ss>There are only two nations who by their agreement can rid the world of those <DATE> weapons -- the United States of America and the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>For the sake of our children and the safety of this <LOC>, we ask the <NORP> -- who have walked out of our negotiations -- to join us in reducing and, yes, ridding the <LOC> of this awful threat</ss>
<ss>When we leave this hall <TIME>, we begin to place those clear choices before our fellow citizens</ss>
<ss>We must not let them be confused by those who still think that GNP stands for gross national promises</ss>
<ss>But after the debates, the position papers, the speeches, the conventions, the television commercials, primaries, caucuses, and slogans -- after all this, is there really any doubt at all about what will happen if we let them win this <DATE>? Is there any doubt that they will raise our taxes? That they will send inflation into orbit again? That they will make government bigger then ever? And deficits even worse? Raise unemployment? Cut back our defense preparedness? Raise interest rates? Make unilaterial and unwise concessions to the <NORP> Union? And they'll do all that in the name of compassion</ss>
<ss>It's what they've done to America in the past</ss>
<ss>But if we do our job right, they won't be able to do it again</ss>
<ss>It's getting late</ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> we asked the people of America, "Are you better off than you were <DATE>?" Well, the people answered then by choosing us to bring about a change</ss>
<ss>We have every reason now, <DATE>, to ask that same question again, for we have made a change</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people joined us and helped us</ss>
<ss>Let us ask for their help again to renew the mandate of <DATE>, to move us further forward on the road we presently travel, the road of common sense, of people in control of their own destiny; the road leading to prosperity and economic expansion in a world at peace</ss>
<ss>As we ask for their help, we should also answer the central question of public service: Why are we here? What do we believe in? Well for one thing, we're here to see that government continues to serve the people and not the other way around</ss>
<ss>Yes, government should do all that is necessary, but only that which is necessary</ss>
<ss>We don't lump people by groups or special interests</ss>
<ss>And let me add, in the party of <ORG>, there is no room for intolerance and not even a small corner for anti-Semitism or bigotry of any kind</ss>
<ss>Many people are welcome in our house, but not the bigots</ss>
<ss>We believe in the uniqueness of each individual</ss>
<ss>We believe in the sacredness of human life</ss>
<ss>For some time now we've all fallen into a pattern of describing our choice as left or right</ss>
<ss>It's become standard rhetoric in discussions of political philosophy</ss>
<ss>But is that really an accurate description of the choice before us? Go back <DATE> to the origin of the terms and see where left or right would take us if we continued far enough in either direction</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>One would take us to <NORP> totalitarianism; the other to the totalitarianism of <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Isn't our choice really not one of left or right, but of up or down? Down through the welfare state to statism, to more and more government largesse accompanied always by more government authority, less individual liberty and, ultimately, totalitarianism, always advanced as for our own good</ss>
<ss>The alternative is the dream conceived by our <ORG>, up to the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society</ss>
<ss>We don't celebrate dependence day on <DATE></ss>
<ss>We celebrate <EVENT></ss>
<ss>We celebrate the right of each individual to be recognized as unique, possessed of dignity and the sacred right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness</ss>
<ss>At the same time, with our independence goes a generosity of spirit more evident here than in almost any other part of the world</ss>
<ss>Recognizing the equality of all men and women, we're willing and able to lift the weak, cradle those who hurt, and nurture the bonds that tie us together as one nation under God</ss>
<ss>Finally, we're here to shield our liberties, not just for now or for <DATE> but forever</ss>
<ss>Could I share a personal thought with you <TIME>, because <TIME>'s kind of special to me</ss>
<ss>It's the last time, of course, that I will address you under these same circumstances</ss>
<ss>I hope you'll invite me back to future conventions</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I will be forever grateful for the honor you've done us, for the opportunity to serve, and for your friendship and trust</ss>
<ss>I began political life as a <NORP>, casting my <ORDINAL> vote in <DATE> for <PERSON></ss>
<ss><DATE>, the <NORP> called for a 25-percent reduction in the cost of government by abolishing useless commissions and offices and consolidating departments and bureaus, and giving more authority to state governments</ss>
<ss>As <DATE> went by and those promises were forgotten, did I leave <ORG>, or did the leadership of that party leave not just me but millions of patriotic <NORP> who believed in the principles and philosophy of that platform? One of the <ORDINAL> to declare this was a former <NORP> nominee for President <PERSON>, <WORK_OF_ART>, who went before the nation in <DATE> to say, on television -- or on radio that he could no longer follow his party's leadership and that he was "taking a walk</ss>
<ss>" As <NORP> leaders have taken their party further and further away from its <ORDINAL> principles, it's no surprise that so many responsible <NORP> feel that our platform is closer to their views, and we welcome them to our side</ss>
<ss><DATE> we raised a banner of bold colors -- no pale pastels</ss>
<ss>We proclaimed a dream of an America that would be "a shining city on a hill</ss>
<ss>" We promised that we'd reduce the growth of the federal government, and we have</ss>
<ss>We said we intended to reduce interest rates and inflation, and we have</ss>
<ss>We said we would reduce taxes to provide incentives for individuals and business to get our economy moving again, and we have</ss>
<ss>We said there must be jobs with a future for our people, not government make-work programs, and, in <DATE>, as I've said, six ad a half million new jobs in the private sector have been created</ss>
<ss>We said we would once again be respected throughout the world, and we are</ss>
<ss>We said we would restore our ability to protect our freedom on land, sea, and in the air, and we have</ss>
<ss>We bring to the <NORP> citizens in <DATE> a record of accomplishment and the promise of continuation</ss>
<ss>We came together in a national crusade to make America great again, and to make a new beginning</ss>
<ss>Well, now it's all coming together</ss>
<ss>With our beloved nation at peace, we're in the midst of a springtime of hope for America</ss>
<ss>Greatness lies ahead of us</ss>
<ss>Holding the Olympic games here in the United States began defining the promise of <DATE></ss>
<ss>All through <DATE>, we marveled at the journey of the Olympic torch as it made its passage east to west</ss>
<ss><QUANTITY>, by some 4,000 runners, that flame crossed a portrait of our nation</ss>
<ss>From our Gotham City, New York, to <ORG>, Boston, across the <NORP> springtime, to the City of the Big Shoulders, Chicago</ss>
<ss>Moving south toward Atlanta, over to St</ss>
<ss>Louis, past its <ORG>, across wheatfields into the stark beauty of the <LOC> and then up into the still, snowcapped Rockies</ss>
<ss>And, after circling the greening Northwest, it came down to California, across <FAC> and finally into Los Angeles</ss>
<ss>And all along the way, that torch became a celebration of America</ss>
<ss>And we all became participants in the celebration</ss>
<ss>Each new story was typical of this land of ours</ss>
<ss>There was <PERSON>, a youngster of 99, who passed the torch in Kansas to 4-year-old <PERSON></ss>
<ss>In Pineville, Kentucky, it came at <DATE>, so hundreds of people lined the streets with candles</ss>
<ss>At <NORP>, Mississippi, at <DATE> on a <DATE> <TIME>, a robed church choir sang "<WORK_OF_ART>" as the torch went by</ss>
<ss>That torch went through <FAC>, past the <PERSON>, Memorial, down <ORG>, and alongside <PERSON> the <PERSON>'s grave</ss>
<ss>In Richardson, Texas, it was carried by a 14-year-old boy in a special wheelchair</ss>
<ss>In West Virginia the runner came across a line of deaf children and let each one pass the torch for <QUANTITY>, and at the end these youngsters' hands talked excitedly in their sign language</ss>
<ss>Crowds spontaneously began singing "<WORK_OF_ART>" or "<WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>" And then, in San Francisco a <NORP> immigrant, his little son held on his shoulders, dodged photographers and policemen to cheer a 19-year-old black man pushing an 88-year-old white woman in a wheelchair as she carried the torch</ss>
<ss>My friends, that's America</ss>
<ss>We cheered in Los Angeles as the flame was carried in and the giant Olympic torch burst into a billowing fire in front of the teams, the youth of 140 nations assembled on the floor of the <PRODUCT></ss>
<ss>And in that moment, maybe you were struck as I was with the uniqueness of what was taking place before a hundred thousand people in the stadium, most of them citizens of our country, and over a billion worldwide watching on television</ss>
<ss>There were athletes representing 140 countries here to compete in the one country in all the world whose people carry the bloodlines of all those 140 countries and more</ss>
<ss>Only in the United States is there such a rich mixture of races, creeds, and nationalities -- only in our melting pot</ss>
<ss>And that brings to mind another torch, the one that greeted so many of our parents and grandparents</ss>
<ss><DATE>, the torch atop the Statue of <PERSON> was hoisted down for replacement</ss>
<ss>We can be forgiven for thinking that maybe it was just worn out from lighting the way to freedom for 17 million new <NORP></ss>
<ss>So, now we'll put up a new one</ss>
<ss>The poet called Miss <PERSON>'s torch the "lamp beside the golden door</ss>
<ss>" Well, that was the entrance to America, and it still is</ss>
<ss>And now you really know why we're here <TIME></ss>
<ss>The glistening hope of that lamp is still ours</ss>
<ss>Every promise, every opportunity is still golden in this land</ss>
<ss>And through that golden door our children can walk into <DATE> with the knowledge that no one can be denied the promise that is America</ss>
<ss>Her heart is full; her door is still golden, her future bright</ss>
<ss>She has arms big enough to comfort and strong enough to support, for the strength in her arms is the strength of her people</ss>
<ss>She will carry on in <DATE> unafraid, unashamed, and unsurpassed</ss>
<ss>In this springtime of hope, some lights seem eternal; America's is</ss>
<ss>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>>         I have a plan -- not a secret plan</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in <DATE></ss>
<ss>It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing</ss>
<ss>Before even <DATE>, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible</ss>
<ss>So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy</ss>
<ss>Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for <DATE> to the point that we can now call it an expansion</ss>
<ss>Under that, <DATE>, we have seen a <MONEY> reduction in the deficit from <DATE>, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates</ss>
<ss>Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery</ss>
<ss>We have reduced inflation to about a <ORDINAL> of what it was</ss>
<ss>The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military</ss>
<ss>So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from <PERCENT>, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet</ss>
<ss>And when they meet, that is a balanced budget</ss>
<ss>The deficit is the result of excessive government spending</ss>
<ss>I do not, very frankly, take seriously <ORG> projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with</ss>
<ss>But it has taken place</ss>
<ss>But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at <PERCENT> -- we're not far from there -- by <DATE> that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $<MONEY> or <MONEY> level</ss>
<ss>At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean <MONEY> more in government revenues</ss>
<ss>And so, I think that the lines can meet</ss>
<ss>Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in <DATE> that we have been here</ss>
<ss>-- that people need</ss>
<ss>These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way</ss>
<ss>The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed</ss>
<ss>Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something <MONEY></ss>
<ss>And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in <NORP> life</ss>
<ss>And that's why the <ORG>, including the <NORP>, have not gone along with the President's recommendations</ss>
<ss>>     Yes</ss>
<ss>I don't believe that Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes</ss>
<ss>And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place <DATE></ss>
<ss>And for <DATE> previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United <ORG>s, and the budgets increased <MONEY></ss>
<ss>So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget</ss>
<ss>Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking</ss>
<ss>With regard to <ORG>, I hope there'll be more time than just <TIME> to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say "never</ss>
<ss>" But I'm going to violate that rule and say "never</ss>
<ss>" I will never stand for a reduction of the <ORG> benefits to the people that are now getting them</ss>
<ss>Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it</ss>
<ss>And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in <ORG> -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge <DATE> tax increase, was a cut of <PERCENT> in the benefits for every <NORP> who was born after <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now, leadership</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in</ss>
<ss>In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society</ss>
<ss>Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government</ss>
<ss>I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in <FAC> deciding who's going to play tennis on <ORG> court</ss>
<ss>And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job</ss>
<ss>You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job</ss>
<ss>But I also believe something else about that</ss>
<ss>I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed <ORG> members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue</ss>
<ss>I don't want to hear them</ss>
<ss>I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue</ss>
<ss>Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment</ss>
<ss>Our policy was not to cut subsidies</ss>
<ss>We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and <ORG> but also between the private sector that built that particular structure</ss>
<ss>And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve <ORG> in such partnerships</ss>
<ss>We are <DATE> subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line</ss>
<ss>We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need</ss>
<ss>We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need</ss>
<ss>The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country</ss>
<ss>The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut <ORG> by <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>It's not an opinion; it's a fact</ss>
<ss>And when the President was asked <DATE>, "What do you want to cut in the budget?" he said, "Cut those things I asked for but didn't get</ss>
<ss>" That's <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate</ss>
<ss>So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all</ss>
<ss>This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there</ss>
<ss>We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions</ss>
<ss>>     Well, let me just respond with regard to <ORG></ss>
<ss>When we took office, we discovered that the program that <ORG> administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of <ORG> for <DATE> wouldn't solve them for 5</ss>
<ss><ORG> was due to go bankrupt before <DATE></ss>
<ss>Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a <NORP>, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce</ss>
<ss>And so, we made a proposal</ss>
<ss>And then in <DATE>, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the <DATE> campaign</ss>
<ss>And <DATE> after the election in <DATE>, they came to us and said, <ORG>, we know, is broke</ss>
<ss>Indeed, we had to borrow <MONEY> to pay the checks</ss>
<ss>And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution</ss>
<ss>And so, the whole matter of what to do with <ORG> has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy</ss>
<ss>In our particular church, we did not use that term, "born again," so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term</ss>
<ss>But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God</ss>
<ss>And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as <ORG> once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others</ss>
<ss>And I do resort to prayer</ss>
<ss>At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s running mate said I wasn't a good <NORP></ss>
<ss>So, it does play a part in my life</ss>
<ss>I have no hesitancy in saying so</ss>
<ss>And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered</ss>
<ss>The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church</ss>
<ss>I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington</ss>
<ss>And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where <ORG> do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate <DATE>, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church</ss>
<ss>I know the threats that are made against me</ss>
<ss>We all know the possibility of terrorism</ss>
<ss>We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around <ORG></ss>
<ss>And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example</ss>
<ss>And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands</ss>
<ss>-- may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause</ss>
<ss>Fred, your <ORDINAL> question</ss>
<ss>>                   -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others</ss>
<ss>A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire</ss>
<ss>The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in</ss>
<ss>It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in <NORP> life -- that's where I draw the line</ss>
<ss>>     Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>I, too, want that wall that is in the <LAW> of separation of church and state to remain there</ss>
<ss>The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the <LAW> that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion</ss>
<ss>And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion</ss>
<ss>A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property</ss>
<ss>These are the types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that</ss>
<ss>With regard to a platform on <ORG>, I can only say one thing about that</ss>
<ss>I have appointed one member to <ORG>: <PERSON></ss>
<ss>I'll stand on my record on that</ss>
<ss>And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her</ss>
<ss>Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made <ORG> a majority</ss>
<ss>Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as <NORP> or <NORP> instead of <NORP>, and the gap -- the edge the <NORP> had in party registration seems to be narrowing</ss>
<ss>I'd like to ask you, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, what is causing this? Is <ORG> out of sync with the majority of <NORP>? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the <NORP>? What do you think needs to be done about it, as a <NORP>?>           Well, again, I'm running on the record</ss>
<ss>I think sometimes Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s running away from his</ss>
<ss>But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for</ss>
<ss>We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from <PERCENT> to <PERCENT>, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and <ORG> governments that has been unjustly seized by <ORG></ss>
<ss>And you might find those words in a <NORP> platform of <DATE> -- I know, because I was a <NORP> at that time</ss>
<ss>And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the <NORP> leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in <ORG>, lacking trust in the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation</ss>
<ss>We have, to one-<ORDINAL> of what it was</ss>
<ss>I promised that we would reduce taxes</ss>
<ss>We did, <PERCENT> across the board</ss>
<ss>That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in <DATE></ss>
<ss>But at least it took that burden away from them</ss>
<ss>I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in <DATE></ss>
<ss>I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>We have done that</ss>
<ss>All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done</ss>
<ss>And I think this is something the <NORP> people see</ss>
<ss>I think they also know that we had a commission that came in <DATE> with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education</ss>
<ss>And <DATE>, without <ORG> being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 <ORG>s with task forces now dealing with their educational problems</ss>
<ss>We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth</ss>
<ss>All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the <ORDINAL> time in <DATE></ss>
<ss>So, I think that many <NORP> are seeing the same thing this <NORP> saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go</ss>
<ss>There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them</ss>
<ss>Crime has come down <DATE>, for the <ORDINAL> time in many, <DATE> that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- <DATE>, and <DATE> it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had</ss>
<ss>I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide</ss>
<ss>The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment</ss>
<ss>When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- <MONEY></ss>
<ss>And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks</ss>
<ss>We have added <QUANTITY> to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges</ss>
<ss>I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue</ss>
<ss>But I've got more</ss>
<ss>Before I campaigned as a <NORP> for a <NORP> candidate for President, I had already voted for <PERSON> to be President of the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>And so, my change had come earlier than that</ss>
<ss>I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet</ss>
<ss>I found that was rather difficult to do</ss>
<ss>But I finally did it</ss>
<ss>There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> referred to the farmers' worst year</ss>
<ss>The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done</ss>
<ss>The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21 1/2-percent interest rates of <ORG> administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier</ss>
<ss>All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of i percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have</ss>
<ss>I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life</ss>
<ss>Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life</ss>
<ss>But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> tied to injecting religion into government</ss>
<ss>With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the <LAW></ss>
<ss>I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the <LAW>, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us</ss>
<ss>And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were <DATE> and <DATE> of testimony before a <ORG> committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of pro-life</ss>
<ss>And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive</ss>
<ss>We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around</ss>
<ss>Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life</ss>
<ss>In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and <ORG> unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-<NORP> Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder</ss>
<ss>Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder? And it used the term "death of the unborn child</ss>
<ss>" So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being</ss>
<ss>The laws regarding that always were state laws</ss>
<ss>It was only when <ORG> handed down a decision that <ORG> intervened in what had always been a state policy</ss>
<ss>Our laws against murder are state laws</ss>
<ss>So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this</ss>
<ss>As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve</ss>
<ss>And no one has approached it from that matter</ss>
<ss>It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma</ss>
<ss>I know that some churches do</ss>
<ss>Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life</ss>
<ss>At the same time, in our <NORP> tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense</ss>
<ss>And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own</ss>
<ss>>     Yes</ss>
<ss>Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that? Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life</ss>
<ss>I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination</ss>
<ss>I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition</ss>
<ss>That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life</ss>
<ss>But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way</ss>
<ss>You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it</ss>
<ss>There you go again</ss>
<ss>I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes</ss>
<ss>I'm not going to increase taxes</ss>
<ss>I can understand why you are, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes</ss>
<ss>Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed</ss>
<ss>And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up</ss>
<ss>And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those <MONEY> actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from $<MONEY> down</ss>
<ss>From $<MONEY> down, those people paid two-<ORDINAL>s of the taxes, and those people got two-<ORDINAL>s of the tax cut</ss>
<ss>Now, the <ORG> tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest</ss>
<ss>It had two features</ss>
<ss>It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come <DATE></ss>
<ss>At the same time <DATE>, it increased the amount of money -- virtually <DATE>, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax</ss>
<ss><DATE> it is up to <MONEY> of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for <ORG></ss>
<ss>And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, <DATE>, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money</ss>
<ss>Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way</ss>
<ss>The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed</ss>
<ss>But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person</ss>
<ss>Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also</ss>
<ss>But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board</ss>
<ss>Yes, I had used -- "last resort" would always be with me</ss>
<ss>If you got the government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted</ss>
<ss>I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax</ss>
<ss>With regard to assailing Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust</ss>
<ss>All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him</ss>
<ss>Yes</ss>
<ss>Mm-hmm</ss>
<ss>And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United <ORG>s, and what are you going to do? You've got a <MONEY> deficit</ss>
<ss>You can't wish it away</ss>
<ss>You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- >         Yes</ss>
<ss>With regard to <ORG>, no, but it's time for us to say that <ORG> is in pretty much the same condition that <ORG> was, and something is going to have to be done in <DATE> to make it fiscally sound</ss>
<ss>And, no, I never proposed any <MONEY> should come out of <ORG>; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem</ss>
<ss>And maybe part of that problem is because during <DATE> of <ORG> administration medical costs in this country went up <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>I gave you back some of that time</ss>
<ss>Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up</ss>
<ss>Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in <DATE> before we got here</ss>
<ss>It has begun to decline, but it is still going up</ss>
<ss>On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the <ORDINAL> time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them</ss>
<ss>We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings</ss>
<ss>It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs</ss>
<ss>We are spending now <PERCENT> more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We're spending a <ORDINAL> more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service</ss>
<ss>We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,<MONEY>0,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 8<MONEY> off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them</ss>
<ss>We found people making <PERCENT> of the poverty level were getting government benefits</ss>
<ss>We have set a line at <PERCENT> so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy</ss>
<ss><DATE>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said something about education and college students and help of that kind</ss>
<ss>Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United <ORG>s are receiving some form of federal aid</ss>
<ss>But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans</ss>
<ss>We didn't think that was right</ss>
<ss>And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low</ss>
<ss>So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have</ss>
<ss>7</ss>
<ss>7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest <PERCENT> of earnings -- 7</ss>
<ss>7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million</ss>
<ss>Yes</ss>
<ss>That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything</ss>
<ss>I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject</ss>
<ss>I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America</ss>
<ss>And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people</ss>
<ss>So, that was the only place that that was used</ss>
<ss>I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes</ss>
<ss>There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession</ss>
<ss>We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country</ss>
<ss>Yes</ss>
<ss>The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them</ss>
<ss>There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in <DATE> while we were operating still on <ORG> budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 21 1/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure</ss>
<ss>And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase</ss>
<ss>They were going up</ss>
<ss>Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down</ss>
<ss>The interest rates are based on inflation</ss>
<ss>And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low</ss>
<ss>I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again</ss>
<ss>Well, it isn't going to go back up</ss>
<ss>We're going to see that it doesn't</ss>
<ss>And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled</ss>
<ss>>   I'm going to use my time a little differently</ss>
<ss>I'm going to give the President some credit</ss>
<ss>I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that</ss>
<ss>What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems</ss>
<ss>I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at <ORDINAL>, but I think it helped a little bit</ss>
<ss>But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training</ss>
<ss>I like President <PERSON></ss>
<ss>And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign</ss>
<ss>>         Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me</ss>
<ss>I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in <DATE></ss>
<ss>And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the <ORG> checks out from those people who are dependent on them</ss>
<ss>And why I think it is outrageous -- <ORDINAL> of all, it isn't true</ss>
<ss>But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on <ORG>, have no place else to turn</ss>
<ss>And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, "Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?" And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog</ss>
<ss>Now, to -- I still -- I just have <TIME> here?     Oh, I --      Okay</ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>Now, <ORG>, let's lay it to rest once and for all</ss>
<ss>I told you never would I do such a thing</ss>
<ss>But I tell you also now, <ORG> has nothing to do with the deficit</ss>
<ss><ORG> is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee</ss>
<ss>If you reduce the out-go of <ORG>, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit</ss>
<ss>It would go into <ORG></ss>
<ss>So, <ORG> has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit</ss>
<ss>Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work</ss>
<ss>And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation</ss>
<ss>And none of these things happened</ss>
<ss>It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line</ss>
<ss>As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry</ss>
<ss>But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented <PERCENT> of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic</ss>
<ss>Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in <DATE>, when the deficit was <MONEY> and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits</ss>
<ss>Remember, there was <MONEY> in debt before we got here</ss>
<ss>That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it</ss>
<ss>And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here</ss>
<ss>That's why I want <DATE></ss>
<ss>No, I might as well just go with-     I don't think so</ss>
<ss>I'm all confused now</ss>
<ss>You don't get those same voices</ss>
<ss>I'm not hearing it from here -- I'm hearing it from here</ss>
<ss>>   All right</ss>
<ss>Well, we'll include it in that</ss>
<ss><DATE>, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the <NORP> people, a question</ss>
<ss>I asked: "Are you better off than you were <DATE>?" The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning</ss>
<ss>Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again</ss>
<ss>I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were <DATE></ss>
<ss>The question, I think, should be enlarged</ss>
<ss>Is America better off than it was <DATE>? And I believe the answer to that has to also be "yes</ss>
<ss>" I promised a new beginning</ss>
<ss>So far, it is only a beginning</ss>
<ss>If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job</ss>
<ss>But we now have an economy that, for the <ORDINAL> time -- well, let's put it this way: In <DATE>, gross national product was down <PERCENT></ss>
<ss><DATE> it's up <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Productivity in <DATE> was down <PERCENT></ss>
<ss><DATE> it is up a plus <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up <MONEY> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> -- or <DATE>, a person with a fixed income of $<MONEY> was $<MONEY> above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty</ss>
<ss>By <DATE> that same person was $<MONEY> below the poverty line</ss>
<ss>We have restored much of our economy</ss>
<ss>With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since <DATE></ss>
<ss>So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital</ss>
<ss>We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for <DATE> now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below</ss>
<ss>We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure</ss>
<ss>Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget</ss>
<ss>But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots</ss>
<ss>We had <ORG> vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts</ss>
<ss><DATE> we're well on our way to a 600-ship <ORG></ss>
<ss>We have 543 at present</ss>
<ss>We have -- our military, the morale is high</ss>
<ss>I think the people should understand that two-<ORDINAL>s of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension</ss>
<ss>And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons</ss>
<ss>But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons</ss>
<ss>There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $<MONEY></ss>
<ss>Well, we are the ones who found those</ss>
<ss>I think we've given the <NORP> people back their spirit</ss>
<ss>I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of <PERSON>, who said: "We have it in our power to begin the world over again</ss>
<ss>"</ss>
<ss>The New Republic magazine; and <PERSON>, diplomatic correspondent for <ORG></ss>
<ss><PERSON>, formerly of <ORG> and now a syndicated columnist for <ORG>, is our moderator</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>>               No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds</ss>
<ss>I have ordered an investigation</ss>
<ss>I know that the <ORG> is already going forward with one</ss>
<ss>We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the <ORG>, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras</ss>
<ss>And he drew up this manual</ss>
<ss>It was turned over to the agency head of the <ORG> in Nicaragua to be printed</ss>
<ss>And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to <ORG>, where more pages were excised before it was printed</ss>
<ss>But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Now, those are the details as we have them</ss>
<ss>And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that</ss>
<ss>We'll take the proper action at the proper time</ss>
<ss>I was very interested to hear about <LOC> and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout <LOC> and working closely with the <PERSON> group</ss>
<ss>So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt</ss>
<ss>But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed</ss>
<ss>I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a <ORG> head in Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>There's not someone there directing all of this activity</ss>
<ss>There are, as you know, <ORG> men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in <LOC></ss>
<ss>And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in <DATE>, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations</ss>
<ss>Yes</ss>
<ss>I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier</ss>
<ss>You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back</ss>
<ss>I never, ever conceived of such a thing</ss>
<ss>I never said any such thing</ss>
<ss>In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that sub<NORP> carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles</ss>
<ss>But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false</ss>
<ss>How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been</ss>
<ss>So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record</ss>
<ss>I'm sure that you appreciate that</ss>
<ss>I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union</ss>
<ss>I retract nothing that I have said</ss>
<ss>I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have</ss>
<ss>But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other</ss>
<ss>And I told Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> we don't like their system</ss>
<ss>They don't like ours</ss>
<ss>And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours</ss>
<ss>But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it</ss>
<ss>And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding</ss>
<ss>I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic</ss>
<ss>I know that Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly</ss>
<ss>And the result was unilateral disarmament</ss>
<ss>We canceled the B-1 under the previous administration</ss>
<ss>What did we get for it? Nothing</ss>
<ss>The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will</ss>
<ss>And now we are putting up a defense of our own</ss>
<ss>And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority</ss>
<ss>We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us</ss>
<ss>Now, they claim they're not</ss>
<ss>And I made it plain to them, we're not</ss>
<ss>There's been no change in my attitude at all</ss>
<ss>I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union</ss>
<ss>And we did get their attention</ss>
<ss>Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, about where we would send troops in to fight</ss>
<ss>I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us</ss>
<ss>One is <LOC>, and that is of interest to the whole <ORG> and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there</ss>
<ss>Our neighbors here in America are vital to us</ss>
<ss>We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern <LOC> with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the <NORP> surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola</ss>
<ss>So, I can say there are a great many interests</ss>
<ss>I believe that we have a great interest in <LOC></ss>
<ss>That is where I think the future of the world lies</ss>
<ss>But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, "Oh, yes, we would send troops there</ss>
<ss>" I don't want to send troops any place</ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>Yes</ss>
<ss>I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here</ss>
<ss>But with regard to whether Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the <LOC> and watching the F-14s take off</ss>
<ss>And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the <LOC> was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any <LOC> to stand on -- he was against it</ss>
<ss>He was against the F-14 fighter, he was against the M-1 tank, he was against the <ORG> bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the <NORP> forces in <LOC></ss>
<ss>And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is <ORDINAL> to none</ss>
<ss>Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout <DATE> in the <ORG></ss>
<ss>And he opposed even President <PERSON>, when toward the end of his term President <PERSON> wanted to increase the defense budget</ss>
<ss>I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union</ss>
<ss>I'll tell you where we disagree</ss>
<ss>It is true over <DATE> I voted to delay production of the F-14, and I'll tell you why</ss>
<ss>The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money</ss>
<ss>Your definition of national strength is to throw money at <ORG></ss>
<ss>My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense</ss>
<ss>There's a big difference between the two of us</ss>
<ss>A President must manage that budget</ss>
<ss>I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need</ss>
<ss>You pay $<MONEY> for a $<MONEY> hammer, you're not buying strength</ss>
<ss>>               No, <PERSON>, I don't agree to all of those things</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> of all, when we and our allies -- the <NORP>, the <NORP>, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the <NORP> government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government</ss>
<ss>But the <ORDINAL> -- pardon me -- the <ORDINAL> time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the <ORG> terrorists</ss>
<ss>Israel could not be blamed for that</ss>
<ss>Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there</ss>
<ss>Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon</ss>
<ss>We departed</ss>
<ss>And then the government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders</ss>
<ss>And we were succeeding</ss>
<ss>We were there for the better part of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our position happened to be at the airport</ss>
<ss>Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission</ss>
<ss>I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back</ss>
<ss>And this is what we did</ss>
<ss>We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there</ss>
<ss>But we were succeeding to the point that the <NORP> government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan</ss>
<ss>We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began</ss>
<ss>There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory</ss>
<ss>And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building</ss>
<ss>Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in</ss>
<ss>But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the <ORDINAL> war between them</ss>
<ss>And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, no</ss>
<ss>I think there's a great difference between the government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on</ss>
<ss>In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over</ss>
<ss>In a recent 30-<DATE> period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed</ss>
<ss>The most recent has been the one in Brighton</ss>
<ss>In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating</ss>
<ss>I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem</ss>
<ss>And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago</ss>
<ss>Well, the red light went on</ss>
<ss>I could have gone on forever</ss>
<ss>Yes</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> of all, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> should know that the President of the United States did not order the <NORP> into that barracks</ss>
<ss>That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there</ss>
<ss>That is one</ss>
<ss>On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do</ss>
<ss>These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it</ss>
<ss>We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken</ss>
<ss>But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, "Oh, look, we got even</ss>
<ss>" We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts</ss>
<ss>And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice</ss>
<ss>Not at all, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign</ss>
<ss>I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience</ss>
<ss>If I still have time, I might add, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I might add that it was <PERSON> or it was <PERSON>, I don't know which, that said, "If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state</ss>
<ss>"     Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks</ss>
<ss>And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based</ss>
<ss>You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up <TIME></ss>
<ss>So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate <ORDINAL> with those</ss>
<ss>And then we made it plain, a <ORDINAL> phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles</ss>
<ss>The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the landbased missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three</ss>
<ss>And we agreed</ss>
<ss>We said, "All right, if that's what you want to do</ss>
<ss>" But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in sub<NORP> and <PERCENT> more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had</ss>
<ss>So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on landbased? But even after we gave in and said, "All right, let's discuss it all," they walked away from the table</ss>
<ss>We didn't</ss>
<ss>Deadly Gambits, concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control</ss>
<ss>That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief</ss>
<ss>Good intentions, I grant</ss>
<ss>But it takes more than that</ss>
<ss>You must be tough and smart</ss>
<ss>>           Yes</ss>
<ss>I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, but I am in charge</ss>
<ss>And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union</ss>
<ss>Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the <NORP> had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in <LOC></ss>
<ss>When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that</ss>
<ss>The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it</ss>
<ss>Deadly Gambits</ss>
<ss>The other is <PERSON>, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country</ss>
<ss>Both said that this administration turned down the "walk in the woods" agreement <ORDINAL>, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in <LOC> and our security</ss>
<ss>When Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired</ss>
<ss>This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times</ss>
<ss>Now we have a runaway arms race</ss>
<ss>All they've got to show for <DATE> in <LOC> relations is one meeting in <DATE> of an administration, and nothing before</ss>
<ss>They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress</ss>
<ss>This one has not</ss>
<ss>>               <PERSON>, we, believe me, supported the <PERSON>-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>However, there were things added in in the <ORG> side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill</ss>
<ss>And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator <PERSON> did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee</ss>
<ss>There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill</ss>
<ss>I can't go into detail about them here</ss>
<ss>But it is true our borders are out of control</ss>
<ss>It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations</ss>
<ss>And I supported this bill</ss>
<ss>I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally</ss>
<ss>With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through <DATE> who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status</ss>
<ss>We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free</ss>
<ss>And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when <ORG> is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders</ss>
<ss>And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our <NORP> friends</ss>
<ss>But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders</ss>
<ss>And we work with those other countries</ss>
<ss>No</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have</ss>
<ss>It's almost like going back to the <NORP> theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then</ss>
<ss>But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration</ss>
<ss>And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs</ss>
<ss>And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem</ss>
<ss>Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border --  -- and it has nothing to do with it</ss>
<ss>But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, they were 21 1/2 -- the prime rate</ss>
<ss>It's now 12 1/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly</ss>
<ss>So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through <DATE>, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of <ORG>, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for <DATE> or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that</ss>
<ss>But no one knows whether <ORG>, those prophecies mean that <ORG> is <DATE> away or <DATE> after <DATE></ss>
<ss>So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to <ORG></ss>
<ss>Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would</ss>
<ss>But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in <LOC> and in <LOC>, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought</ss>
<ss>And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage</ss>
<ss>But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the <WORK_OF_ART> concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles</ss>
<ss>And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?     Why not? What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete? There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counter-weapon</ss>
<ss>But suppose we came up with that? Now, some people have said, "Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a <ORDINAL> strike because we could defend against the enemy</ss>
<ss>" But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do? Say, "Look, here's what we can do</ss>
<ss>We'll even give it to you</ss>
<ss>Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?" I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon</ss>
<ss>Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, "Now, are you willing to join us? Here's what we" -- give them a demonstration and then say -- "Here's what we can do</ss>
<ss>Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>" But when you keep <ORG> it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist</ss>
<ss>I said, and <ORG> agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon</ss>
<ss>And suddenly somebody says, "Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's <WORK_OF_ART>," and so forth</ss>
<ss>I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off</ss>
<ss>If they're antisatellite weapons, I assume they're going to be aimed against satellites</ss>
<ss>Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> try to spy on us, steal this stuff</ss>
<ss>And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with</ss>
<ss>You haven't just accepted research, Mr</ss>
<ss>President</ss>
<ss>You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of <MONEY> for this purpose</ss>
<ss>This is an arms escalation</ss>
<ss>And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do</ss>
<ss>If some<DATE>, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else</ss>
<ss>But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable</ss>
<ss>Why do we start things that we know the <NORP> will match and make us all less secure? That's what a President's for</ss>
<ss>>                   Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow</ss>
<ss>And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States</ss>
<ss>And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch</ss>
<ss>I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either</ss>
<ss>I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed</ss>
<ss>I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy</ss>
<ss>And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to <ORG> that I thought we should do this</ss>
<ss>Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, "Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded," and you have another <NORP> power on your hands</ss>
<ss>Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with <ORG>, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world</ss>
<ss>And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done</ss>
<ss>I am not going to roll over, as Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us</ss>
<ss>But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, <ORDINAL> of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission</ss>
<ss>But Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> seems to approve <ORG> -- <ORG> is mutual assured destruction-meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours</ss>
<ss>I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights</ss>
<ss>>         Yes</ss>
<ss>My thanks to <ORG>, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting</ss>
<ss>I think the <NORP> people <TIME> have much to be grateful for -- an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace</ss>
<ss>I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, <DATE>, to eliminate them entirely</ss>
<ss>The question before you comes down to this: Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of <DATE>? Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong? We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present</ss>
<ss>The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all <NORP> and that they need</ss>
<ss><DATE>, I was given an assignment to write a letter</ss>
<ss>It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in <DATE> when that time capsule was opened</ss>
<ss>I remember driving down the California coast <DATE></ss>
<ss>My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them</ss>
<ss>But I couldn't completely neglect the beauty around me -- the <LOC> out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side</ss>
<ss>And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone-wondering if someone <DATE> would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing</ss>
<ss>And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter</ss>
<ss>I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know <DATE></ss>
<ss>We know nothing about them</ss>
<ss>They would know all about our problems</ss>
<ss>They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through <DATE> or whether it hurt them</ss>
<ss>They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of <TIME> and destroying civilization as we knew it</ss>
<ss>And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say <DATE>, what are those people <DATE> going to think? They will know whether we used those weapons or not</ss>
<ss>Well, what they will say <DATE> <DATE> depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny</ss>
<ss>Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that <DATE>, down in history <DATE> or perhaps before, someone will say, "Thank God for those people back in <DATE> for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called <LOC>, with all its grandeur and its beauty</ss>
<ss>" You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for <DATE>, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted <DATE></ss>
<ss><PERSON>, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had -- <PERSON> and I have crisscrossed the country, and we've had, in <DATE>, a wonderful experience</ss>
<ss>We have met young America</ss>
<ss>We have met your sons and daughters</ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>I was just going to --      I know</ss>
<ss>I know, yes</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Senator <PERSON>, Chief <PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON>, Speaker <PERSON>, Senator <PERSON>, reverend clergy, and members of my family and friends and my fellow citizens: <DATE> has been made brighter with the presence here of one who, for a time, has been absent</ss>
<ss>Senator <PERSON>, <PERSON> bless you and welcome back</ss>
<ss>There is, however, one who is not with us <DATE></ss>
<ss>Representative <PERSON> of Louisiana left us <TIME></ss>
<ss>And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer</ss>
<ss>Amen</ss>
<ss>There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you've bestowed on me</ss>
<ss>I'll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust</ss>
<ss>This is, as Senator <PERSON> told us, the <ORDINAL> time that we, the people, have celebrated this historic occasion</ss>
<ss>When the <ORDINAL> President, <PERSON>, placed his hand upon the <WORK_OF_ART>, he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness</ss>
<ss>There were 4 million <NORP> in a union of 13 <ORG>s</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>We've lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed to the <PERSON> and safely returned</ss>
<ss>So much has changed, and yet we stand together as we did <DATE></ss>
<ss>When I took this oath <DATE>, I did so in a time of economic stress</ss>
<ss>Voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory</ss>
<ss>But we, the <DATE> <NORP>, are not given to looking backward</ss>
<ss>In this blessed land, there is always a better <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE>, I spoke to you of a New Beginning, and we have accomplished that</ss>
<ss>But in another sense, our New Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created <DATE> when, for the <ORDINAL> time in history, government, the people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to have</ss>
<ss>That system has never failed us, but for a time we failed the system</ss>
<ss>We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give</ss>
<ss>We yielded authority to <ORG> that properly belonged to <ORG>s or to local governments or to the people themselves</ss>
<ss>We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on <LOC> slow down and the number of unemployed increase</ss>
<ss>By <DATE> we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom, consistent with an orderly society</ss>
<ss>We believed then and now: There are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams</ss>
<ss>And we were right to believe that</ss>
<ss>Tax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history</ss>
<ss>We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive</ss>
<ss>But there are many mountains yet to climb</ss>
<ss>We will not rest until every <NORP> enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright</ss>
<ss>It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic</ss>
<ss>And if we meet this challenge, these will be <DATE> when <NORP> have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and developing new technologies, helped preserve peace in a troubled world; when America courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from <NORP> darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom</ss>
<ss>My fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness</ss>
<ss>We must do what we know is right, and do it with all our might</ss>
<ss>Let history say of us: "These were golden <DATE> -- when <EVENT> was reborn, when freedom gained new life, and America reached for her best</ss>
<ss>Our two-party system has solved us -- served us, I should say, well over <DATE>, but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as <NORP> or <NORP>, but as <NORP> united in a common cause</ss>
<ss>Two of our <ORG>, a Boston lawyer named <PERSON> and a Virginia planter named <PERSON>, members of that remarkable group who met in <ORG> and dared to think they could start the world over again, left us an important lesson</ss>
<ss>They had become, in <DATE> then in government, bitter political rivals in the Presidential election of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Then, <DATE>, when both were retired and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each other again through letters</ss>
<ss>A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, the <ORDINAL> anniversary of <WORK_OF_ART>, they both died</ss>
<ss>They died on <DATE>, within <TIME> of each other, and <DATE> was <DATE></ss>
<ss>In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, <PERSON> wrote: "It carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government</ss>
<ss>Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>we rode through the storm with heart and hand</ss>
<ss>" Well, with heart and hand let us stand as one <DATE> -- one people under <PERSON>, determined that our future shall be worthy of our past</ss>
<ss>As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past</ss>
<ss>We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment</ss>
<ss>You elected us in <DATE> to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe you reelected us in <DATE> to reverse course</ss>
<ss>At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by <DATE> of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress</ss>
<ss>We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people's lives</ss>
<ss>We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn</ss>
<ss>We must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every <NORP> who seeks work can find work, so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things -- to be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place</ss>
<ss>The time has come for a new <NORP> emancipation -- a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country</ss>
<ss>My friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me <PERSON></ss>
<ss>From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled, and united people, and a stronger America -- an America that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love</ss>
<ss>A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits</ss>
<ss>But an almost unbroken <DATE> of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning</ss>
<ss>We've come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions</ss>
<ss>I have asked the <ORG> and my staff a question and now I put the same question to all of you</ss>
<ss>If not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget</ss>
<ss>We can then begin reducing the national debt</ss>
<ss>I will shortly submit a budget to the <ORG> aimed at freezing government program spending for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Beyond this, we must take further steps to permanently control government's power to tax and spend</ss>
<ss>We must act now to protect future generations from government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due</ss>
<ss>Let us make it unconstitutional for <ORG> to spend more than <ORG> takes in</ss>
<ss>We have already started returning to the people and to <ORG> and local governments responsibilities better handled by them</ss>
<ss>Now, there is a place for <ORG> in matters of social compassion</ss>
<ss>But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged</ss>
<ss>And here, a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient</ss>
<ss>Now, there is another area where <ORG> can play a part</ss>
<ss>As an older <NORP>, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law</ss>
<ss>There's no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we've made toward the brotherhood of man that <PERSON> intended for us</ss>
<ss>Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens</ss>
<ss>Let us resolve that we, the people, will build an <NORP> opportunity society in which all of us -- white and black, rich and poor, young and old -- will go forward together, arm in arm</ss>
<ss>Again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the <LOC>, we are all <NORP>, pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on <LOC></ss>
<ss>I've spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our <ORG></ss>
<ss>Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of <ORG> -- the safety and security of our people</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Yet history has shown that peace does not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone</ss>
<ss>There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom</ss>
<ss>One nation, the Soviet <ORG>, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons</ss>
<ss>We've made progress in restoring our defense capability</ss>
<ss>But much remains to be done</ss>
<ss>There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace</ss>
<ss>There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it</ss>
<ss>And this we're trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet <ORG></ss>
<ss>We're not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons; we seek, instead, to reduce their number</ss>
<ss>We seek the total elimination <DATE> of nuclear weapons from the face of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Now, for <DATE>, we and the <NORP> have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction -- if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it</ss>
<ss>Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs? I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target</ss>
<ss>It wouldn't kill people; it would destroy weapons</ss>
<ss>It wouldn't militarize space; it would help demilitarize the arsenals of <LOC></ss>
<ss>It would render nuclear weapons obsolete</ss>
<ss>We will meet with the <NORP>, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction</ss>
<ss>We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE>, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold</ss>
<ss>Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere</ss>
<ss>Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit</ss>
<ss>People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress</ss>
<ss>America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally and it is the world's only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace</ss>
<ss>Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war</ss>
<ss>Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace</ss>
<ss>So, we go forward <DATE>, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose</ss>
<ss>With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look to a future rich in possibilities</ss>
<ss>And all of this is because we worked and acted together, not as members of political parties but as <NORP></ss>
<ss>My friends, we live in a world that's lit by lightning</ss>
<ss>So much is changing and will change, but so much endures and transcends time</ss>
<ss>History is a ribbon, always unfurling</ss>
<ss>History is a journey</ss>
<ss>And as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us</ss>
<ss>We stand again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy -- well, we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't gotten so cold</ss>
<ss>Now we're standing inside this symbol of our democracy, and we see and hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of <ORG>; a lonely President paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the <ORG>; the men of the <FAC> call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air</ss>
<ss>It is the <NORP> sound</ss>
<ss>It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair</ss>
<ss>That's our heritage, that's our song</ss>
<ss>We sing it still</ss>
<ss>For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old</ss>
<ss>We raise our voices to the <PERSON> who is the Author of this most tender music</ss>
<ss>And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound -- in unity, affection, and love -- one people under <PERSON>, dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: I come before you to report on the state of our <ORG>, and I'm pleased to report that after <D<FAC>E> of <ORG>, the <NORP> people have brought forth a nation renewed, stronger, freer, and more secure than before</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> we began to change, forever I hope, our assumptions about government and its place in our lives</ss>
<ss>Out of that change has come great and robust growth-in our confidence, our economy, and our role in the world</ss>
<ss><TIME> America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear</ss>
<ss>We believe faith and freedom must be our guiding stars, for they show us truth, they make us brave, give us hope, and leave us wiser than we were</ss>
<ss>Our progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of our families, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together, are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under <PERSON></ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people greater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more of what they earned</ss>
<ss>We did what we promised, and a great industrial giant is reborn</ss>
<ss><TIME> we can take pride in <D<FAC>E> of economic growth, the strongest in <D<FAC>E>; a 3-year inflation average of <PERCENT>, the lowest in <D<FAC>E>; and 7</ss>
<ss>3 million new jobs in <D<FAC>E>, with more of our citizens working than ever before</ss>
<ss>New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success: For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if  the family goes, so goes our civilization; For an America of vision that sees <D<FAC>E>'s dreams in the learning and hard work we do <D<FAC>E>; For an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet, proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom; For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help</ss>
<ss>We have begun well</ss>
<ss>But it's only a beginning</ss>
<ss>We're not here to congratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to finish what has not yet been done</ss>
<ss>We're here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach</ss>
<ss>We're here to speak for the <NORP> farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries fighting to modernize and compete</ss>
<ss>And, yes, we're here to stand, and proudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, for all who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and human happiness</ss>
<ss>Proverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish</ss>
<ss>When asked what great principle holds our <ORG> together, <PERSON> said: "Something in  Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time</ss>
<ss>" We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw</ss>
<ss>My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for greatness</ss>
<ss>The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge -- a <ORDINAL> <EVENT> of hope and opportunity; a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space; a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to summon greater strength than we've ever known; and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of peace</ss>
<ss>Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom</ss>
<ss>There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect</ss>
<ss>Already, pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth</ss>
<ss>In <LOC>, they're calling it "the <NORP> Miracle</ss>
<ss>" Day by day, we're shattering accepted notions of what is possible</ss>
<ss>When I was growing up, we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace</ss>
<ss>Well, <D<FAC>E>, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives</ss>
<ss>In the late <D<FAC>E>'s workers at the <FAC> and T semiconductor plant in Pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for $<MONEY> apiece</ss>
<ss>They now produce over a million for <MONEY> apiece</ss>
<ss>New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from <D<FAC>E> to <TIME>, reduce hospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving human lives</ss>
<ss>Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased worker productivity, and is competitive once again</ss>
<ss>We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be more</ss>
<ss>Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it's getting younger and stronger</ss>
<ss>It doesn't need rest and supervision; it needs new challenge, greater freedom</ss>
<ss>And that word "freedom" is the key to the <ORDINAL> <NORP> revolution that we need to bring about</ss>
<ss>Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> I asked <ORG> Secretary-then-Regan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code, so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down</ss>
<ss>We have cut tax rates by <PERCENT>, yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth</ss>
<ss>Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels</ss>
<ss>Low-income families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder</ss>
<ss><ORG> has produced an excellent reform plan, whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact</ss>
<ss>One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise</ss>
<ss>We will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need</ss>
<ss>We will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax preferences</ss>
<ss>We will propose a top rate of <PERCENT>, and possibly lower</ss>
<ss>And we will propose reducing corporate rates, while maintaining incentives for capital formation</ss>
<ss>To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally exempt from <ORG> income tax</ss>
<ss>To restore fairness to families, we will propose increasing significantly the personal exemption</ss>
<ss>And <TIME>, I am instructing <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> -- I have to get used to saying that -- to begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles</ss>
<ss>We will call upon the <NORP> people for support and upon every man and woman in this Chamber</ss>
<ss>Together, we can pass, <D<FAC>E>, a tax bill for fairness, simplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our dreams and America the investment capital of the world</ss>
<ss>So let us begin</ss>
<ss>Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous pent-up power of our economy</ss>
<ss>But a <ORDINAL> <NORP> revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all</ss>
<ss>It is time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country</ss>
<ss>This government will meet its responsibility to help those in need</ss>
<ss>But policies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroy self-respect are not progressive; they're reactionary</ss>
<ss>Despite our strides in civil rights, blacks, <NORP>, and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power</ss>
<ss>We have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in the abandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build better lives</ss>
<ss>This legislation is supported by a majority of you</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I know we agree that 'there must be no forgotten <NORP></ss>
<ss>Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>And, Tip, you could make that a birthday present</ss>
<ss>Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal</ss>
<ss>We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate, find <D<FAC>E> jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures</ss>
<ss>We'll continue to support <ORG>, which has a nearly two-thirds job placement rate</ss>
<ss>Credits in education and health care vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need</ss>
<ss>Our administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings</ss>
<ss>It's time that all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom</ss>
<ss>But States and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery, must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth</ss>
<ss>Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom</ss>
<ss>There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions</ss>
<ss>Well, the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth</ss>
<ss>More businesses will be started, more investments made, more jobs created, and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes</ss>
<ss>The best way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity</ss>
<ss>Each added percentage point per year of real GNP growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of <MONEY> over <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten government's claim on our total economy</ss>
<ss>We will not do this by raising taxes</ss>
<ss>We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in spending by <ORG></ss>
<ss>In <D<FAC>E> budget, overall government program spending will be frozen at the current level</ss>
<ss>It must not be one dime higher than <D<FAC>E>, and three points are key</ss>
<ss>First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled, and unemployed will be left intact</ss>
<ss>Growth of our major health care programs, <ORG> and <ORG>, will be slowed, but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved</ss>
<ss>Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional corps</ss>
<ss>National security is government's <ORDINAL> responsibility; so in <D<FAC>E> defense spending took about half the <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> it takes less than a third</ss>
<ss>We've already reduced our planned defense expenditures by <MONEY> over <D<FAC>E> and reduced projected spending again <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>You know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy</ss>
<ss>Spending for defense is investing in things that are priceless -- peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies</ss>
<ss>For example, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares, but on <ORG> taxpayers pay <MONEY> per passenger every time an <ORG> train leaves the station, It's time we ended this huge <ORG> subsidy</ss>
<ss>Our farm program costs have quadrupled in <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>Yet I know from visiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an orderly transition to a market-oriented farm economy</ss>
<ss>We can help farmers best not by expanding <ORG> payments but by making fundamental reforms, keeping interest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign trade barriers to <NORP> farm exports</ss>
<ss>We're moving ahead with <ORG> reforms to eliminate waste and improve government's management practices</ss>
<ss>In the long run, we must protect the taxpayers from government</ss>
<ss>And I ask again that you pass, as 32 States have now called for, an amendment mandating <ORG> spend no more than it takes in</ss>
<ss>And I ask for the authority, used responsibly by 43 <ORG>, to veto individual items in appropriation bills</ss>
<ss>Senator <PERSON> has introduced a bill permitting a 2-year trial run of the line-item veto</ss>
<ss>I hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> of government living beyond its means has brought us to a time of reckoning</ss>
<ss>Ours is but a moment in history</ss>
<ss>But one moment of courage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change <NORP> history forever</ss>
<ss>Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and stability</ss>
<ss>We will continue to cooperate with <ORG>, seeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping interest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth</ss>
<ss>Reducing unneeded red tape and regulations, and deregulating the energy, transportation, and financial industries have unleashed new competition, giving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices</ss>
<ss>In just one set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31</ss>
<ss>We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring us closer to energy independence</ss>
<ss>Consistent with safety standards, we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries, we will soon end up legislation -- or send up legislation, I should say -- to return <ORG> to the private sector where it belongs, and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry</ss>
<ss>Every dollar <ORG> does not take from us, every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant, our future more free</ss>
<ss>Our <ORDINAL> <NORP> revolution will push on to new possibilities not only on <LOC> but in the next frontier of space</ss>
<ss>Despite budget restraints, we will seek record funding for research and development</ss>
<ss>We've seen the success of the space shuttle</ss>
<ss>Now we're going to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise, because in <D<FAC>E> <NORP> and our friends around the world will be living and working together in space</ss>
<ss>In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in <D<FAC>E> lifesaving medicines it would take <D<FAC>E> to make on <LOC></ss>
<ss>We can make crystals of exceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs, technologies, and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible</ss>
<ss>As we do all this, we'll continue to protect our natural resources</ss>
<ss>We will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the <LAW> program to continue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and the environment</ss>
<ss>Now, there's another great heritage to speak of <TIME></ss>
<ss>Of all the changes that have swept America <D<FAC>E>, none brings greater promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work, and neighborhood</ss>
<ss>We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship; renewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered by our young, who are leading the way</ss>
<ss>We've rediscovered that work is good in and of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our jobs</ss>
<ss>We've seen a powerful new current from an old and honorable tradition -- <NORP> generosity</ss>
<ss>From thousands answering <ORG> appeals to help boost food production in <LOC>, to millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools, and communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home, we have refound our values</ss>
<ss>Private sector initiatives are crucial to our future</ss>
<ss>I thank the <ORG> for passing equal access legislation giving religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy</ss>
<ss>But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a child stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer</ss>
<ss>We ask you again, give children back a right they had for <D<FAC>E> in this country</ss>
<ss>The question of abortion grips our nation</ss>
<ss>Abortion is either the taking of a human life or it isn't</ss>
<ss>And if it is -- and medical technology is increasingly showing it is -- it must be stopped</ss>
<ss>It is a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt</ss>
<ss>We have room for these children</ss>
<ss>We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love</ss>
<ss>And <TIME> I ask you in the <ORG> to move <D<FAC>E> on legislation to protect the unborn</ss>
<ss>In the area of education, we're returning to excellence, and again, the heroes are our people, not government</ss>
<ss>We're stressing basics of discipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become computer-smart as well</ss>
<ss>For <D<FAC>E> scholastic aptitude test scores of our high school students went down, but now they have gone up 2 of <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay</ss>
<ss>Of all the changes in <D<FAC>E>, none has more threatened our sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime</ss>
<ss>One does not have to be attacked to be a victim</ss>
<ss>The woman who must run to her car after shopping at <TIME> is a victim</ss>
<ss>The couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims; as is the tired, decent cleaning woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid</ss>
<ss>We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants</ss>
<ss>But shouldn't we feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime? For the <ORDINAL> time in <D<FAC>E>, the crime index has fallen <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>We've convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them, as well as leaders of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers</ss>
<ss>But we must do more</ss>
<ss>I urge the <ORG> to follow the <ORG> and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith</ss>
<ss>These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus laws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of <NORP>, the use of the death penalty where necessary</ss>
<ss>There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us are allowed to roam free</ss>
<ss>It's time we restored domestic tranquility</ss>
<ss>And we mean to do just that</ss>
<ss>Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy, we're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world</ss>
<ss>Our alliances are stronger than ever</ss>
<ss>Our economy is stronger than ever</ss>
<ss>We have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world</ss>
<ss>And all of these together are a great force for peace</ss>
<ss>Since <D<FAC>E> we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals</ss>
<ss>Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the <NORP> <ORG> to return to the bargaining table</ss>
<ss>Our negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>All of us have no greater dream than to see <D<FAC>E> when nuclear weapons are banned from this <LOC> forever</ss>
<ss>Each Member of the <ORG> has a role to play in modernizing our defenses, thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement</ss>
<ss>Your vote <D<FAC>E> on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms reductions</ss>
<ss>For <D<FAC>E> we've believed that no war will be launched as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike</ss>
<ss>Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war</ss>
<ss>It is a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missiles</ss>
<ss>It's the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age</ss>
<ss>But it's not very well understood</ss>
<ss>Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Now, some say the research would be expensive</ss>
<ss>Perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself</ss>
<ss>And some say if we build such a system, the <NORP> will build a defense system of their own</ss>
<ss>Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours; a civil defense system, where we have almost none; and a research program covering roughly the same areas of technology that we're now exploring</ss>
<ss>And finally some say the research will take a long time</ss>
<ss>Well, the answer to that is: Let's get started</ss>
<ss><PERSON> once said that, ultimately, our security and the world's hopes for peace and human progress "lie not in measures of defense or in the control of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and self-government</ss>
<ss>" And <TIME>, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of all <PERSON>'s children</ss>
<ss>Look to where peace and prosperity flourish <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>It is in homes that freedom built</ss>
<ss>Victories against poverty are greatest and peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, free speech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth</ss>
<ss>Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to communicate these ideals everywhere we can</ss>
<ss>America's economic success is freedom's success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations</ss>
<ss>Many countries in <LOC> and the <LOC> have few resources other than the enterprise of their own people</ss>
<ss>But through low tax rates and free markets they've soared ahead of centralized economies</ss>
<ss>And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs</ss>
<ss>We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and implementing trade policy, and we'll be studying potential changes in that process in <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>We've seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism</ss>
<ss><TIME> I ask all our trading partners, developed and developing alike, to join us in a new round of trade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economy -- and to begin it in <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>There are <MONEY> human beings living in Third World countries with an average per capita income of $<MONEY> a year</ss>
<ss>Many are victims of dictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption</ss>
<ss>Let us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these people climb from poverty on their own</ss>
<ss>We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that's not innocent; nor can we be passive when freedom is under siege</ss>
<ss>Without resources, diplomacy cannot succeed</ss>
<ss>Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace</ss>
<ss>And I hope that you in the <ORG> will understand that, dollar for dollar, security assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense budget</ss>
<ss>We must stand by all our democratic allies</ss>
<ss>And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives -- on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua -- to defy <NORP>-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full <NORP>-<NORP> bloc support, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free press, but arms and provides bases for <NORP> terrorists attacking neighboring states</ss>
<ss>Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and totally consistent with the <ORG> and <PERSON></ss>
<ss>It is essential that the <ORG> continue all facets of our assistance to <LOC></ss>
<ss>I want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to our own security</ss>
<ss>And <TIME>, I've spoken of great plans and great dreams</ss>
<ss>They're dreams we can make come true</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> of <NORP> history should have taught us that nothing is impossible</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the exodus that followed the fall of Saigon</ss>
<ss>They came to the United States with no possessions and not knowing a word of <LANGUAGE></ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> -- the young girl studied hard, learned <LANGUAGE>, and finished high school in the top of her class</ss>
<ss>And this May, May 22d to be exact, is a big date on her calendar</ss>
<ss><D<FAC>E> from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point</ss>
<ss>I thought you might like to meet an <NORP> hero named <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Now, there's someone else here <TIME>, born <D<FAC>E></ss>
<ss>She lives in the inner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin addicts</ss>
<ss>The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even dropped on her doorstep</ss>
<ss>She helps them with love</ss>
<ss>Go to her house <TIME>, and maybe you'll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor talking softly, soothing a child in her arms-<PERSON> of <LOC>, and she, too, is an <NORP> hero</ss>
<ss>Jean, <PERSON>, your lives tell us that the oldest <NORP> saying is new again: Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the will, and the heart</ss>
<ss>History is asking us once again to be a force for good in the world</ss>
<ss>Let us begin in unity, with justice, and love</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and <PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Chancellor <PERSON> and honored guests, this painful walk into the past has done much more than remind us of the war that consumed <ORG></ss>
<ss>What we have seen makes unforgettably clear that no one of the rest of us can fully understand the enormity of the feelings carried by the victims of these camps</ss>
<ss>The survivors carry a memory beyond anything that we can comprehend</ss>
<ss>The awful evil started by one man, an evil that victimized all the world with its destruction, was uniquely destructive of the millions forced into the grim abyss of these camps</ss>
<ss>Here lie people -- <NORP> -- whose death was inflicted for no reason other than their very existence</ss>
<ss>Their pain was borne only because of who they were and because of the God in their prayers</ss>
<ss>Alongside them lay many <NORP> -- <NORP> and <NORP></ss>
<ss>For year after year, until that man and his evil were destroyed, hell yawned forth its awful contents</ss>
<ss>People were brought here for no other purpose but to suffer and die -- to go unfed when hungry, uncared for when sick, tortured when the whim struck, and left to have misery consume them when all there was around them was misery</ss>
<ss>I'm sure we all share similar <ORDINAL> thoughts, and that is: What of the youngsters who died at this dark stalag? All was gone for them forever -- not to feel again the warmth of life's sunshine and promise, not the laughter and the splendid ache of growing up, nor the consoling embrace of a family</ss>
<ss>Try to think of being young and never having <DATE> without searing emotional and physical pain -- desolate, unrelieved pain</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we've been grimly reminded why the commandant of this camp was named "the Beast of Belsen</ss>
<ss>" Above all, we're struck by the horror of it all -- the monstrous, incomprehensible horror</ss>
<ss>And that's what we've seen but is what we can never understand as the victims did</ss>
<ss>Nor with all our compassion can we feel what the survivors feel to <DATE> and what they will feel as long as they live</ss>
<ss>What we've felt and are expressing with words cannot convey the suffering that they endured</ss>
<ss>That is why history will forever brand what happened as the <EVENT></ss>
<ss>Here, death ruled, but we've learned something as well</ss>
<ss>Because of what happened, we found that death cannot rule forever, and that's why we're here <DATE></ss>
<ss>We're here because humanity refuses to accept that freedom of the spirit of man can ever be extinguished</ss>
<ss>We're here to commemorate that life triumphed over the tragedy and the death of the <EVENT> -- overcame the suffering, the sickness, the testing and, yes, the gassings</ss>
<ss>We're here <DATE> to confirm that the horror cannot outlast hope, and that even from the worst of all things, the best may come forth</ss>
<ss>Therefore, even out of this overwhelming sadness, there must be some purpose, and there is</ss>
<ss>It comes to us through the transforming love of God</ss>
<ss>We learn from the <ORG> that: "It was only through suffering that the children of Israel obtained three priceless and coveted gifts: The Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World to Come</ss>
<ss>" Yes, out of this sickness -- as crushing and cruel as it was -- there was hope for the world as well as for the world to come</ss>
<ss>Out of the ashes -- hope, and from all the pain -- promise</ss>
<ss>So much of this is symbolized <DATE> by the fact that most of the leadership of free <NORP>y is represented here <DATE></ss>
<ss>Chancellor <PERSON>, you and your countrymen have made real the renewal that had to happen</ss>
<ss>Your nation and the <NORP> people have been strong and resolute in your willingness to confront and condemn the acts of a hated regime of the past</ss>
<ss>This reflects the courage of your people and their devotion to freedom and justice since the war</ss>
<ss>Think how far we've come from that time when despair made these tragic victims wonder if anything could survive</ss>
<ss>As we flew here from Hanover, low over the greening farms and the emerging springtime of the lovely <NORP> countryside, I reflected, and there must have been a time when the prisoners at <ORG> and those of every other camp must have felt the springtime was gone forever from their lives</ss>
<ss>Surely we can understand that when we see what is around us -- all these children of God under bleak and lifeless mounds, the plainness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them</ss>
<ss>Here they lie, never to hope, never to pray, never to love, never to heal, never to laugh, never to cry</ss>
<ss>And too many of them knew that this was their fate, but that was not the end</ss>
<ss>Through it all was their faith and a spirit that moved their faith</ss>
<ss>Nothing illustrates this better than the story of a young girl who died here at <ORG></ss>
<ss>For <DATE> <PERSON> and her family had hidden from the <NORP> in a confined annex in Holland where she kept a remarkably profound diary</ss>
<ss>Betrayed by an informant, <PERSON> and her family were sent by freight car <ORDINAL> to <ORG> and finally here to <ORG></ss>
<ss><DATE> before her capture, young <PERSON> wrote these words: "It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out</ss>
<ss>Yet I keep them because in spite of everything I still believe that people are good at heart</ss>
<ss>I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death</ss>
<ss>I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness</ss>
<ss>I hear the ever approaching thunder which will destroy us too; I can feel the suffering of millions and yet, if I looked up into the heavens I think that it will all come right, that this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again</ss>
<ss>" <DATE>, this sparkling young life ended here at <ORG></ss>
<ss>Somewhere here lies <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Everywhere here are memories -- pulling us, touching us, making us understand that they can never be erased</ss>
<ss>Such memories take us where God intended His children to go -- toward learning, toward healing, and, above all, toward redemption</ss>
<ss>They beckon us through the endless stretches of our heart to the knowing commitment that the life of each individual can change the world and make it better</ss>
<ss>We're all witnesses; we share the glistening hope that rests in every human soul</ss>
<ss>Hope leads us, if we're prepared to trust it, toward what our President <PERSON> called the better angels of our nature</ss>
<ss>And then, rising above all this cruelty, out of this tragic and nightmarish time, beyond the anguish, the pain and the suffering for all time, we can and must pledge: Never again</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Members of the <ORG>, distinguished guests, and my fellow <NORP>: It's great to be home, and <PERSON> and I thank you for this wonderful homecoming</ss>
<ss>And before I go on, I want to say a personal thank you to <PERSON></ss>
<ss>She was an outstanding Ambassador of good will for all of us</ss>
<ss>She didn't know I was going to say that</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Senator <PERSON>, I want you to know that your statements of support here were greatly appreciated</ss>
<ss>You can't imagine how much it means in dealing with the <NORP> to have the <ORG>, the allies, and the <NORP> people firmly behind you</ss>
<ss>I guess you know that I have just come from Geneva and talks with <ORG> Secretary <PERSON></ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, <DATE>, we spent <TIME> in various meetings with the <ORG> Secretary and the members of his official party</ss>
<ss>And approximately 5 of those hours were talks between Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and myself, just one on one</ss>
<ss>That was the best part -- our fireside summit</ss>
<ss>There will be, I know, a great deal of commentary and opinion as to what the meetings produced and what they were like</ss>
<ss>There were over 3,000 reporters in Geneva, so it's possible there will be 3,000 opinions on what happened</ss>
<ss>So, maybe it's the old broadcaster in me, but I decided to file my own report directly to you</ss>
<ss>We met, as we had to meet</ss>
<ss>I called for a fresh start, and we made that start</ss>
<ss>I can't claim that we had a meeting of the minds on such fundamentals as ideology or national purpose, but we understand each other better, and that's a key to peace</ss>
<ss>I gained a better perspective; I feel he did, too</ss>
<ss>It was a constructive meeting; so constructive, in fact, that I look forward to welcoming Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> to the United States <DATE></ss>
<ss>And I have accepted his invitation to go to Moscow <DATE></ss>
<ss>We arranged that out in the parking lot</ss>
<ss>I found Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> to be an energetic defender of <NORP> policy</ss>
<ss>He was an eloquent speaker and a good listener</ss>
<ss>Our subject matter was shaped by the facts of <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE> have not been an easy time for the <LOC> or for the world</ss>
<ss>You know the facts; there is no need to recite the historical record</ss>
<ss>Suffice it to say that the United States cannot afford illusions about the nature of the <PERSON>S</ss>
<ss>R</ss>
<ss>We cannot assume that their ideology and purpose will change; this implies enduring competition</ss>
<ss>Our task is to assure that this competition remains peaceful</ss>
<ss>With all that divides us, we cannot afford to let confusion complicate things further</ss>
<ss>We must be clear with each other and direct</ss>
<ss>We must pay each other the tribute of candor</ss>
<ss>When I took the oath of office for the <ORDINAL> time, we began dealing with the <NORP> Union in a way that was more realistic than in, say, the recent past</ss>
<ss>And so, in a very real sense, preparations for the summit started not <DATE>, but <DATE> when, with the help of <ORG>, we began strengthening our economy, restoring our national will, and rebuilding our defenses and alliances</ss>
<ss>America is once again strong, and our strength has given us the ability to speak with confidence and see that no true opportunity to advance freedom and peace is lost</ss>
<ss>We must not now abandon policies that work</ss>
<ss>I need your continued support to keep America strong</ss>
<ss>That is the history behind the Geneva summit, and that is the context in which it occurred</ss>
<ss>And may I add that we were especially eager that our meetings give a push to important talks already underway on reducing nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>On this subject it would be foolish not to go the extra mile or, in this case, the extra <QUANTITY></ss>
<ss>We discussed the great issues of our time</ss>
<ss>I made clear before the <ORDINAL> meeting that no question would be swept aside, no issue buried, just because either side found it uncomfortable or inconvenient</ss>
<ss>I brought these questions to the summit and put them before Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them</ss>
<ss>I explained our proposals for equitable, verifiable, and deep reductions</ss>
<ss>I outlined my conviction that our proposals would make not just for a world that feels safer, but one that really is safer</ss>
<ss>I am pleased to report <TIME> that <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> and I did make a measure of progress here</ss>
<ss>We have a long way to go, but we're still heading in the right direction</ss>
<ss>We moved arms control forward from where we were <DATE>, when the <NORP> returned to the table</ss>
<ss>We are both instructing our negotiators to hasten their vital work</ss>
<ss>The world is waiting for results</ss>
<ss>Specifically, we agreed in Geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arms by <PERCENT> in appropriate categories</ss>
<ss>In our joint statement we called for early progress on this, turning the talks toward our chief goal -- offensive reductions</ss>
<ss>We called for an interim accord on intermediate-range nuclear forces, leading, I hope, to the complete elimination of this class of missiles -- and all of this with tough verification</ss>
<ss>We also made progress in combating, together, the spread of nuclear weapons, an arms control area in which we've cooperated effectively over <DATE></ss>
<ss>We are also opening a dialog on combating the spread and use of chemical weapons, while moving to ban them altogether</ss>
<ss>Other arms control dialogs -- in Vienna on conventional forces and in Stockholm on lessening the chances for surprise attack in <LOC> -- also received a boost</ss>
<ss>And finally, we agreed to begin work on risk reduction centers, a decision that should give special satisfaction to Senators <PERSON> and <ORG> who so ably promoted this idea</ss>
<ss>I described our Strategic Defense Initiative, our research effort, that envisions the possibility of defensive systems which could ultimately protect all nations against the danger of nuclear war</ss>
<ss>This discussion produced a very direct exchange of views</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> insisted that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapons into space and establish nuclear superiority</ss>
<ss>I made it clear that SDI has nothing to do with offensive weapons; that, instead, we are investigating nonnuclear defense systems that would only threaten offensive missiles, not people</ss>
<ss>If our research succeeds, it will bring much closer the safer, more stable world that we seek</ss>
<ss>Nations could defend themselves against missile attack and mankind, at long last, escape the prison of mutual terror</ss>
<ss>And this is my dream</ss>
<ss>So, I welcomed the chance to tell Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> that we are a nation that defends, rather than attacks; that our alliances are defensive, not offensive</ss>
<ss>We don't seek nuclear superiority</ss>
<ss>We do not seek a <ORDINAL> strike advantage over the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>Indeed, one of my fundamental arms control objectives is to get rid of <ORDINAL>-strike weapons altogether</ss>
<ss>This is why we've proposed a 50-percent reduction in the most threatening nuclear weapons, especially those that could carry out a <ORDINAL> strike</ss>
<ss>I went further in expressing our peaceful intentions</ss>
<ss>I described our proposal in the Geneva negotiations for a reciprocal program of open laboratories in strategic defense research</ss>
<ss>We're offering to permit <NORP> experts to see <ORDINAL>hand that SDI does not involve offensive weapons</ss>
<ss><NORP> scientists would be allowed to visit comparable facilities of the <NORP> strategic defense program, which, in fact, has involved much more than research for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Finally, I reassured Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> on another point</ss>
<ss>I promised that if our research reveals that a defense against nuclear missiles is possible, we would sit down with our allies and the <NORP> Union to see how together we could replace all strategic ballistic missiles with such a defense, which threatens no one</ss>
<ss>We discussed threats to the peace in several regions of the world</ss>
<ss>I explained my proposals for a peace process to stop the wars in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Angola, and Cambodia -- those places where insurgencies that speak for the people are pitted against regimes which obviously do not represent the will or the approval of the people</ss>
<ss>I tried to be very clear about where our sympathies lie; I believe I succeeded</ss>
<ss>We discussed human rights</ss>
<ss>We <NORP> believe that history teaches no clearer lesson than this: Those countries which respect the rights of their own people tend, inevitably, to respect the rights of their neighbors</ss>
<ss>Human rights, therefore, is not an abstract moral issue; it is a peace issue</ss>
<ss>Finally, we discussed the barriers to communication between our societies, and I elaborated on my proposals for real people-to-people contacts on a wide scale</ss>
<ss><NORP> should know the people of the <NORP> Union -- their hopes and fears and the facts of their lives</ss>
<ss>And citizens of the <NORP> Union need to know of America's deep desire for peace and our unwavering attachment to freedom</ss>
<ss>As you can see, our talks were wide ranging</ss>
<ss>And let me at this point tell you what we agreed upon and what we didn't</ss>
<ss>We remain far apart on a number of issues, as had to be expected</ss>
<ss>However, we reached agreement on a number of matters, and as I mentioned, we agreed to continue meeting, and this is important and very good</ss>
<ss>There's always room for movement, action, and progress when people are talking to each other instead of about each other</ss>
<ss>We've concluded a new agreement designed to bring the best of America's artists and academics to the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>The exhibits that will be included in this exchange are one of the most effective ways for the average <NORP> citizen to learn about our way of life</ss>
<ss>This agreement will also expand the opportunities for <NORP> to experience the <NORP> people's rich cultural heritage, because their artists and academics will be coming here</ss>
<ss>We've also decided to go forward with a number of people-to-people initiatives that will go beyond greater contact, not only between the political leaders of our two countries but our respective students, teachers, and others as well</ss>
<ss>We have emphasized youth exchanges</ss>
<ss>And this will help break down stereotypes, build friendships, and, frankly, provide an alternative to propaganda</ss>
<ss>We've agreed to establish a new <NORP> consulate in New York and a new <NORP> consulate in Kiev</ss>
<ss>And this will bring a permanent <PERSON> presence to the Ukraine for the <ORDINAL> time in <DATE></ss>
<ss>And we have also, together with <ORG>, concluded a <LOC> air safety agreement with the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>This is designed to set up cooperative measures to improve civil air safety in that region of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>What happened before must never to be allowed to happen there again</ss>
<ss>And as a potential way of dealing with the energy needs of the world of the future, we have also advocated international cooperation to explore the feasibility of developing fusion energy</ss>
<ss>All of these steps are part of a long-term effort to build a more stable relationship with the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>No one ever said it could be easy, but we've come a long way</ss>
<ss>As for <NORP> expansionism in a number of regions of the world -- while there is little chance of immediate change, we will continue to support the heroic efforts of those who fight for freedom</ss>
<ss>But we have also agreed to continue, and to intensify, our meetings with the <NORP> on this and other regional conflicts and to work toward political solutions</ss>
<ss>We know the limits as well as the promise of summit meetings</ss>
<ss>This is, after all, the <ORDINAL> summit of the postwar era and still the differences endure</ss>
<ss>But we believe continued meetings between the leaders of the United States and the <NORP> Union can help bridge those differences</ss>
<ss>The fact is, every new day begins with possibilities; it's up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace</ss>
<ss>Hope, therefore, is a realistic attitude and despair an uninteresting little vice</ss>
<ss>And so, was our journey worthwhile? Well, <DATE>, when <PERSON>, <PERSON> <PERSON>, had just returned from a summit in Geneva, he said, "</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>the wide gulf that separates so far <LOC> and <LOC> is wide and deep</ss>
<ss>" Well, <DATE>, <DATE>, that is still true</ss>
<ss>But, yes, this meeting was worthwhile for both sides</ss>
<ss>A new realism spawned the summit</ss>
<ss>The summit itself was a good start, and now our byword must be: steady as we go</ss>
<ss>I am, as you are, impatient for results</ss>
<ss>But good will and good hopes do not always yield lasting results, and quick fixes don't fix big problems</ss>
<ss>Just as we must avoid illusions on our side, so we must dispel them on the <NORP> side</ss>
<ss>I have made it clear to Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> that we must reduce the mistrust and suspicions between us if we are to do such things as reduce arms, and this will take deeds, not words alone</ss>
<ss>And I believe he is in agreement</ss>
<ss>Where do we go from here? Well, our desire for improved relations is strong</ss>
<ss>We're ready and eager for step-by-step progress</ss>
<ss>We know that peace is not just the absence of war</ss>
<ss>We don't want a phony peace or a frail peace</ss>
<ss>We didn't go in pursuit of some kind of illusory detente</ss>
<ss>We can't be satisfied with cosmetic improvements that won't stand the test of time</ss>
<ss>We want real peace</ss>
<ss>As I flew back <TIME>, I had many thoughts</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> families across America will gather to celebrate <LOC></ss>
<ss>And again, as our forefathers who voyaged to America, we traveled to Geneva with peace as our goal and freedom as our guide</ss>
<ss>For there can be no greater good than the quest for peace and no finer purpose than the preservation of freedom</ss>
<ss>It is <DATE> since <DATE>, when <NORP> and <NORP> huddled together on the edge of an unknown continent</ss>
<ss>And now here we are gathered together on the edge of an unknown future, but, like our forefathers, really not so much afraid, but full of hope and trusting in <PERSON>, as ever</ss>
<ss>Thank you for allowing me to talk to you <TIME>, and <PERSON> bless you all</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you <TIME> to report on the state of the <ORG>, but the events of <TIME> have led me to change those plans</ss>
<ss><DATE> is a day for mourning and remembering</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle <ORG></ss>
<ss>We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country</ss>
<ss>This is truly a national loss</ss>
<ss><DATE>, almost to <DATE>, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground</ss>
<ss>But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this</ss>
<ss>And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle</ss>
<ss>But they, the <ORG> Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly</ss>
<ss>We mourn seven heroes: <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <ORG></ss>
<ss>We mourn their loss as a nation together</ss>
<ss>For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy</ss>
<ss>But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much</ss>
<ss>Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, "Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy</ss>
<ss>" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths</ss>
<ss>They wished to serve, and they did</ss>
<ss>They served all of us</ss>
<ss>We've grown used to wonders in <DATE></ss>
<ss>It's hard to dazzle us</ss>
<ss>But for <DATE> the United States space program has been doing just that</ss>
<ss>We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun</ss>
<ss>We're still pioneers</ss>
<ss>They, the members of the <ORG> crew, were pioneers</ss>
<ss>And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff</ss>
<ss>I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen</ss>
<ss>It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery</ss>
<ss>It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons</ss>
<ss>The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them</ss>
<ss>I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened <DATE> does nothing to diminish it</ss>
<ss>We don't hide our space program</ss>
<ss>We don't keep secrets and cover things up</ss>
<ss>We do it all up front and in public</ss>
<ss>That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for <TIME></ss>
<ss>We'll continue our quest in space</ss>
<ss>There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space</ss>
<ss>Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue</ss>
<ss>I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for <ORG> or who worked on this mission and tell them: "Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for <DATE></ss>
<ss>And we know of your anguish</ss>
<ss>We share it</ss>
<ss>" There's a coincidence <DATE></ss>
<ss>On <DATE> <DATE>, the great explorer Sir <PERSON> died aboard ship off the coast of Panama</ss>
<ss>In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, "He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it</ss>
<ss>" Well, <DATE> we can say of the <ORG> crew: Their dedication was, like <PERSON>'s, complete</ss>
<ss>The crew of the space shuttle <ORG> honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives</ss>
<ss>We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, <TIME>, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and "slipped the surly bonds of earth" to "touch the face of God</ss>
<ss>"</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of the <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Thank you for allowing me to delay my address until <TIME></ss>
<ss>We paused together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven <NORP> heroes</ss>
<ss>And I hope that we are now ready to do what they would want us to do: Go forward, America, and reach for the stars</ss>
<ss>We will never forget those brave seven, but we shall go forward</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out that <MONEY> <DATE> and last State of <ORG> that you've presided over</ss>
<ss>And on behalf of the <NORP> people, I want to salute you for your service to <ORG> and country</ss>
<ss>Here's to you!  I have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of unfinished work, and to set our sights on the future</ss>
<ss>I am pleased to report the state of our <ORG> is stronger than <DATE> and growing stronger <DATE></ss>
<ss><TIME> we look out on a rising America, firm of heart, united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism</ss>
<ss>America is on the move! But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land: locked factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices, and interest rates turning the greatest country on <LOC> into a land of broken dreams</ss>
<ss>Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant, slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom</ss>
<ss>What brought America back? The <NORP> people brought us back with quiet courage and common sense, with undying faith that in this nation under <PERSON> the future will be ours; for the future belongs to the free</ss>
<ss><TIME> the <NORP> people deserve our thanks for <DATE> of economic growth, for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9 million new jobs in <DATE>, interest rates cut in half, inflation falling over from <PERCENT> in <DATE> to under 4 <DATE>, and a mighty river of good works-<MONEY> in voluntary giving <DATE> alone</ss>
<ss>And despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain the moral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for the future</ss>
<ss>Family and community are the costars of this great <NORP> comeback</ss>
<ss>They are why we say <TIME>: Private values must be at the heart of public policies</ss>
<ss>What is true for families in America is true for America in the family of free nations</ss>
<ss>History is no captive of some inevitable force</ss>
<ss>History is made by men and women of vision and courage</ss>
<ss><TIME> freedom is on the march</ss>
<ss>The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which the world once again turns</ss>
<ss>We stand for an idea whose time is now: Only by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nations be secure</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said that a nation that does great work lives forever</ss>
<ss>We have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons</ss>
<ss>It's time for America to be all that we can be</ss>
<ss>We speak <TIME> of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer, more secure world</ss>
<ss>And we speak about the necessity for actions to steel us for the challenges of growth, trade, and security in <DATE> and <DATE></ss>
<ss>And we will do it -- not by breaking faith with bedrock principles but by breaking free from failed policies</ss>
<ss>Let us begin where storm clouds loom darkest -- right here in Washington, DC</ss>
<ss><DATE> I will send you our detailed proposals; <TIME> let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government's role: not to control, not to demand or command, not to contain us, but to help in times of need and, above all, to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all <NORP> can climb toward economic power and justice on their own</ss>
<ss>But we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can't even pass a <ORG> budget</ss>
<ss>We cannot win that race held back by horse-and-buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human potential</ss>
<ss>We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink</ss>
<ss>Now, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, you know, I know, and the <NORP> people know the <ORG> budget system is broken</ss>
<ss>It doesn't work</ss>
<ss>Before we leave this city, let's you and I work together to fix it, and then we can finally give the <NORP> people a balanced budget</ss>
<ss>Members of <ORG>, passage of <LAW> gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for <DATE>: forcing <ORG> to live within its means</ss>
<ss>Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by <DATE>, <DATE> America's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce</ss>
<ss>How often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxes and bills</ss>
<ss>And yet some in <ORG> say taxes must be raised</ss>
<ss>Well, I'm sorry; they're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts</ss>
<ss>It's time we reduce the <ORG> budget and left the family budget alone</ss>
<ss>We do not face large deficits because <NORP> families are undertaxed; we face those deficits because <ORG> overspends</ss>
<ss>The detailed budget that we will submit will meet the <LAW> target for deficit reductions, meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense, meet our commitment to protect <ORG> and the truly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our commitment to not raise taxes</ss>
<ss>How should we accomplish this? Well, not by taking from those in need</ss>
<ss>As families take care of their own, government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves</ss>
<ss>But we must revise or replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entire communities into a bleak and heartless dependency</ss>
<ss><LAW> can mark a dramatic improvement</ss>
<ss>But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they'll be met</ss>
<ss>We must proceed with <ORG> reforms against waste</ss>
<ss>And <TIME> I ask you to give me what 43 Governors have: Give me a line-item veto <DATE></ss>
<ss>Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat</ss>
<ss>This authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit</ss>
<ss>And you can sustain or override my veto; that's the way the system should work</ss>
<ss>Once we've made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains with a balanced budget amendment to the <LAW></ss>
<ss>I mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense</ss>
<ss>We must meet it</ss>
<ss>Defense is not just another budget expense</ss>
<ss>Keeping America strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of <ORG>; it is government's prime responsibility</ss>
<ss>We have devoted <DATE> trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect, and we've made important gains</ss>
<ss>Yet the threat from <NORP> forces, conventional and strategic, from the <NORP> drive for domination, from the increase in espionage and state terror remains great</ss>
<ss>This is reality</ss>
<ss>Closing our eyes will not make reality disappear</ss>
<ss>We pledged together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare minimum</ss>
<ss>My budget honors that pledge, and I'm now asking you, the <ORG>, to keep its end of the bargain</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> must know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a reduced resolve</ss>
<ss>Keeping America strong is as vital to the national security as controlling <ORG> spending is to our economic security</ss>
<ss>But, as I have said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the <ORG> deficit is an ever-expanding <NORP> economy, unfettered and free</ss>
<ss>The magic of opportunity-unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained-isn't this the calling that unites us? I believe our tax rate cuts for the people have done more to spur a spirit of risk-taking and help America's economy break free than any program since <PERSON> tax cut <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay their fair share, but no more</ss>
<ss>We've come this far</ss>
<ss>Will you join me now, and we'll walk this last mile together? You know my views on this</ss>
<ss>We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise</ss>
<ss>True reform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and that means a top personal rate no higher than 35 percent</ss>
<ss>True reform must be truly fair, and that means raising personal exemptions to $<MONEY></ss>
<ss>True reform means a tax system that at long last is profamily, projobs, profuture, and pro-America</ss>
<ss>As we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts for freer and fairer trade</ss>
<ss>We have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets</ss>
<ss>We will continue to do so</ss>
<ss>We will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in reality pits one <NORP> worker against another, one industry against another, one community against another, and that raises prices for us all</ss>
<ss>If the United States can trade with other nations on a level playing field, we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anywhere in the world</ss>
<ss>The constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world</ss>
<ss>We must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters</ss>
<ss><ORG>, in particular, have suffered from past unwise government policies</ss>
<ss>They must not be abandoned with problems they did not create and cannot control</ss>
<ss>We've begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners</ss>
<ss>But there's more to do, and <TIME> I am directing <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> to determine if the nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currencies</ss>
<ss>Confident in our future and secure in our values, <NORP> are striving forward to embrace the future</ss>
<ss>We see it not only in our recovery but in <DATE> of falling crime rates, as families and communities band together to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness and to give back to their children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they deserve</ss>
<ss>We see it in the renaissance in education, the rising <ORG> scores for <DATE> -- <DATE> increase, the greatest since <DATE></ss>
<ss>It wasn't government and Washington lobbies that turned education around; it was the <NORP> people who, in reaching for excellence, knew to reach back to basics</ss>
<ss>We must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools, vouchers that give parents freedom of choice; and we must give back to our children their lost right to acknowledge <PERSON> in their classrooms</ss>
<ss>We are a nation of idealists, yet <DATE> there is a wound in our national conscience</ss>
<ss>America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our <PERSON> is denied to the unborn</ss>
<ss>For the rest of my time, I shall do what I can to see that this wound is <DATE> healed</ss>
<ss>As we work to make the <NORP> dream real for all, we must also look to the condition of America's families</ss>
<ss>Struggling parents <DATE> worry how they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave them</ss>
<ss>In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic support system, has reached crisis proportions -- female and child poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools</ss>
<ss>After <MONEY> in poverty programs, the plight of the poor grows more painful</ss>
<ss>But the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss: the sinful waste of human spirit and potential</ss>
<ss>We can ignore this terrible truth no longer</ss>
<ss>As <PERSON> warned <DATE>, standing before this Chamber, he said, "Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit</ss>
<ss>" And we must now escape the spider's web of dependency</ss>
<ss><TIME> I am charging <ORG> to present me by <DATE>, an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the financial, educational, social, and safety concerns of poor families</ss>
<ss>I'm talking about real and lasting emancipation, because the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare</ss>
<ss>Further, after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family, I am directing the Secretary of <ORG>, Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, to report to me by <DATE> with recommendations on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes</ss>
<ss>And <TIME> I want to speak directly to America's younger generation, because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands</ss>
<ss>With all the temptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of the permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control</ss>
<ss>But the call of the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in the blind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair</ss>
<ss>Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement</ss>
<ss>As they said in the film "<WORK_OF_ART>," "Where we're going, we don't need roads</ss>
<ss>" Well, <DATE> physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith</ss>
<ss>Astronomers build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation</ss>
<ss>So, yes, this nation remains fully committed to America's space program</ss>
<ss>We're going forward with our shuttle flights</ss>
<ss>We're going forward to build our space station</ss>
<ss>And we are going forward with research on a new <ORG> that could, by <DATE>, take off from <FAC> , accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low <LOC> orbit or flying to Tokyo within <TIME></ss>
<ss>And the same technology transforming our lives can solve the greatest problem of <DATE></ss>
<ss>A security shield can <DATE> render nuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror</ss>
<ss>America met one historic challenge and went to the <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Now America must meet another: to make our strategic defense real for all the citizens of planet <LOC></ss>
<ss>Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future: to leave our children a land that is free and just and a world at peace</ss>
<ss>It is my hope that our fireside summit in Geneva and Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s upcoming visit to America can lead to a more stable relationship</ss>
<ss>Surely no people on <LOC> hate war or love peace more than we <NORP></ss>
<ss>But we cannot stroll into the future with childlike faith</ss>
<ss>Our differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged right to command people's lives and to export its ideology by force are deep and abiding</ss>
<ss>Logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by realism -- rock-hard, cleareyed, steady, and sure</ss>
<ss>Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side with no cheating</ss>
<ss>They have made clear that <NORP> compliance with the letter and spirit of agreements is essential</ss>
<ss>If the <NORP> Government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be such an agreement</ss>
<ss>But arms control is no substitute for peace</ss>
<ss>We know that peace follows in freedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied</ss>
<ss>So, we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by bolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we can</ss>
<ss>We advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf of lower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the world</ss>
<ss>We strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come to the aid of friends under siege</ss>
<ss>And we can enlarge the family of free nations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all <PERSON>'s children to follow their dreams</ss>
<ss>To those imprisoned in regimes held captive, to those beaten for daring to fight for freedom and democracy -- for their right to worship, to speak, to live, and to prosper in the family of free nations -- we say to you <TIME>: You are not alone, freedom fighters</ss>
<ss>America will support with moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but to fight and win freedom -- to win freedom in Afghanistan, in Angola, in Cambodia, and in Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>This is a great moral challenge for the entire free world</ss>
<ss>Surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the security of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests, than to achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua's democratic neighbors</ss>
<ss><DATE> I will be asking <ORG> for the means to do what must be done for that great and good cause</ss>
<ss>As  <PERSON>, the inspiration for our <ORG> on <LOC>, once said, "In matters of national security, the best politics is no politics</ss>
<ss>" What we accomplish <DATE>, in each challenge we face, will set our course for the balance of <DATE>, indeed, for the remainder of <DATE></ss>
<ss>After all we've done so far, let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams</ss>
<ss>America believes, America is ready, America can win the race to the future -- and we shall</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> dream is a song of hope that rings through <TIME> <DATE> air; vivid, tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest things: to venture a daring enterprise; to unearth new beauty in music, literature, and art; to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell</ss>
<ss>We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of <PERSON></ss>
<ss>All his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine</ss>
<ss>And, <PERSON>, we know that the experiment that you began in high school was launched and lost <DATE>, yet your dream lives</ss>
<ss>And as long as it's real, work of noble note will yet be done, work that could reduce the harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the golden gateways of the farthest stars</ss>
<ss>We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old, <PERSON></ss>
<ss>A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer</ss>
<ss>He also directs the choirs of three churches and has performed at <FAC></ss>
<ss>With <PERSON> as your composer, <PERSON>, your music will be the music of angels</ss>
<ss>We see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13-year-old <PERSON>, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol</ss>
<ss>Seeing another girl freeze in terror before an out-of-control school bus, she risked her life and pulled her to safety</ss>
<ss>With bravery like yours, <NORP>, America need never fear for our future</ss>
<ss>And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a <DATE>, <PERSON></ss>
<ss><DATE>, <DATE>, watching men and women bedding down in abandoned doorways -- on television he was watching -- Trevor left his suburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and homeless</ss>
<ss>And now 250 people help him fulfill his <TIME>ly vigil</ss>
<ss>Trevor, yours is the living spirit of brotherly love</ss>
<ss>Would you four stand up for a moment? Thank you, thank you</ss>
<ss>You are heroes of our hearts</ss>
<ss>We look at you and know it's true: In this land of dreams fulfilled, where greater dreams may be imagined, nothing is impossible, no victory is beyond our reach, no glory will ever be too great</ss>
<ss>So, now it's up to us, all of us, to prepare America for <DATE> when our work will pale before the greatness of America's champions in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The world's hopes rest with America's future; America's hopes rest with us</ss>
<ss>So, let us go forward to create our world of <DATE> in faith, in unity, and in love</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: At <TIME> eastern time, air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters, terrorist facilities, and military assets that support <PERSON> subversive activities</ss>
<ss>The attacks were concentrated and carefully targeted to minimize casualties among the <NORP> people with whom we have no quarrel</ss>
<ss>From initial reports, our forces have succeeded in their mission</ss>
<ss><DATE> in New Orleans, I warned Colonel <PERSON> we would hold his regime accountable for any new terrorist attacks launched against <NORP> citizens</ss>
<ss>More recently I made it clear we would respond as soon as we determined conclusively who was responsible for such attacks</ss>
<ss>On <DATE> in West Berlin a terrorist bomb exploded in a nightclub frequented by <NORP> servicemen</ss>
<ss>Sergeant <PERSON> and a young <NORP> woman were killed and 230 others were wounded, among them some 50 <NORP> military personnel</ss>
<ss>This monstrous brutality is but the latest act in Colonel <PERSON>'s reign of terror</ss>
<ss>The evidence is now conclusive that the terrorist bombing of <FAC> discotheque was planned and executed under the direct orders of the <NORP> regime</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, <DATE> before the attack, orders were sent from Tripoli to <ORG> in East Berlin to conduct a terrorist attack against <NORP> to cause maximum and indiscriminate casualties</ss>
<ss>Libya's agents then planted the bomb</ss>
<ss>On <DATE> <ORG> alerted Tripoli that the attack would be carried out <TIME></ss>
<ss>The next day they reported back to Tripoli on the great success of their mission</ss>
<ss>Our evidence is direct; it is precise; it is irrefutable</ss>
<ss>We have solid evidence about other attacks <PERSON> has planned against the United States installations and diplomats and even <NORP> tourists</ss>
<ss>Thanks to close cooperation with our friends, some of these have been prevented</ss>
<ss>With the help of <NORP> authorities, we recently aborted one such attack: a planned massacre, using grenades and small arms, of civilians waiting in line for visas at an <ORG></ss>
<ss>Colonel <PERSON> is not only an enemy of the United States</ss>
<ss>His record of subversion and aggression against the neighboring states in <LOC> is well documented and well known</ss>
<ss>He has ordered the murder of fellow <NORP> in countless countries</ss>
<ss>He has sanctioned acts of terror in <LOC>, <LOC>, and <LOC>, as well as <LOC></ss>
<ss><DATE> we have done what we had to do</ss>
<ss>If necessary, we shall do it again</ss>
<ss>It gives me no pleasure to say that, and I wish it were otherwise</ss>
<ss>Before <PERSON> seized power in <DATE>, the people of Libya had been friends of the United States</ss>
<ss>And I'm sure that <DATE> most <NORP> are ashamed and disgusted that this man has made their country a synonym for barbarism around the world</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people are a decent people caught in the grip of a tyrant</ss>
<ss>To our friends and allies in <LOC> who cooperated in <DATE>'s mission, I would only say you have the permanent gratitude of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss><NORP> who remember history understand better than most that there is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil</ss>
<ss>It must be the core of <NORP> policy that there be no sanctuary for terror</ss>
<ss>And to sustain such a policy, free men and free nations must unite and work together</ss>
<ss>Sometimes it is said that by imposing sanctions against Colonel <PERSON> or by striking at his terrorist installations we only magnify the man's importance, that the proper way to deal with him is to ignore him</ss>
<ss>I do not agree</ss>
<ss>Long before I came into this office, Colonel <PERSON> had engaged in acts of international terror, acts that put him outside the company of civilized men</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, however, he suffered no economic or political or military sanction; and the atrocities mounted in number, as did the innocent dead and wounded</ss>
<ss>And for us to ignore by inaction the slaughter of <NORP> civilians and <NORP> soldiers, whether in nightclubs or airline terminals, is simply not in the <NORP> tradition</ss>
<ss>When our citizens are abused or attacked anywhere in the world on the direct orders of a hostile regime, we will respond so long as I'm in <ORG></ss>
<ss>Self-defense is not only our right, it is our duty</ss>
<ss>It is the purpose behind the mission undertaken <TIME>, a mission fully consistent with <LAW></ss>
<ss>We believe that this preemptive action against his terrorist installations will not only diminish Colonel <PERSON>'s capacity to export terror, it will provide him with incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior</ss>
<ss>I have no illusion that <TIME>'s action will ring down the curtain on <PERSON>'s reign of terror</ss>
<ss>But this mission, violent though it was, can bring closer a safer and more secure world for decent men and women</ss>
<ss>We will persevere</ss>
<ss><TIME> we consulted with the leaders of <ORG> regarding what we were about to do and why</ss>
<ss><TIME> I salute the skill and professionalism of the men and women of our <ORG> who carried out this mission</ss>
<ss>It's an honor to be your Commander in Chief</ss>
<ss>We <NORP> are slow to anger</ss>
<ss>We always seek peaceful avenues before resorting to the use of force -- and we did</ss>
<ss>We tried quiet diplomacy, public condemnation, economic sanctions, and demonstrations of military force</ss>
<ss>None succeeded</ss>
<ss>Despite our repeated warnings, <PERSON> continued his reckless policy of intimidation, his relentless pursuit of terror</ss>
<ss>He counted on America to be passive</ss>
<ss>He counted wrong</ss>
<ss>I warned that there should be no place on <LOC> where terrorists can rest and train and practice their deadly skills</ss>
<ss>I meant it</ss>
<ss>I said that we would act with others, if possible, and alone if necessary to ensure that terrorists have no sanctuary anywhere</ss>
<ss><TIME>, we have</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and <PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>The President</ss>
<ss>Good evening</ss>
<ss>Usually, I talk with you from my office in the West Wing of <FAC></ss>
<ss>But <TIME> there's something special to talk about, and I've asked someone very special to join me</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I are here in <FAC> of <FAC>, and around us are the rooms in which we live</ss>
<ss>It's the home you've provided for us, of which we merely have temporary custody</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s joining me because the message <TIME> is not my message but ours</ss>
<ss>And we speak to you not simply as fellow citizens but as fellow parents and grandparents and as concerned neighbors</ss>
<ss>It's back-to-school time for America's children</ss>
<ss>And while drug and alcohol abuse cuts across all generations, it's especially damaging to the young people on whom our future depends</ss>
<ss>So <TIME>, from our family to yours, from our home to yours, thank you for joining us</ss>
<ss>America has accomplished so much in <DATE>, whether it's been rebuilding our economy or serving the cause of freedom in the world</ss>
<ss>What we've been able to achieve has been done with your help -- with us working together as a nation united</ss>
<ss>Now, we need your support again</ss>
<ss>Drugs are menacing our society</ss>
<ss>They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions</ss>
<ss>They're killing our children</ss>
<ss>From the beginning of our administration, we've taken strong steps to do something about this horror</ss>
<ss><TIME> I can report to you that we've made much progress</ss>
<ss>Thirty-seven federal agencies are working together in a vigorous national effort, and by <DATE> our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than tripled from its <DATE> levels</ss>
<ss>We have increased seizures of illegal drugs</ss>
<ss>Shortages of marijuana are now being reported</ss>
<ss><DATE> alone over 10,000 drug criminals were convicted and <MONEY> of their assets were seized by the <ORG>, <ORG></ss>
<ss>And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> the number of high school seniors using marijuana on a <DATE> basis has dropped from 1 in <DATE> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The U</ss>
<ss>S</ss>
<ss>military has cut the use of illegal drugs among its personnel by <PERCENT> since <DATE></ss>
<ss>These are a measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy</ss>
<ss>But we still have much to do</ss>
<ss>Despite our best efforts, illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels, and 4 to 5 million people regularly use it</ss>
<ss>Five hundred thousand <NORP> are hooked on heroin</ss>
<ss>One in twelve persons smokes marijuana regularly</ss>
<ss>Regular drug use is even higher among the age group 18 to 25 -- most likely just entering the workforce</ss>
<ss><DATE> there's a new epidemic: smokable cocaine, otherwise known as crack</ss>
<ss>It is an explosively destructive and often lethal substance which is crushing its users</ss>
<ss>It is an uncontrolled fire</ss>
<ss>And drug abuse is not a so-called victimless crime</ss>
<ss>Everyone's safety is at stake when drugs and excessive alcohol are used by people on the highways or by those transporting our citizens or operating industrial equipment</ss>
<ss>Drug abuse costs you and your fellow <NORP> <MONEY> a year</ss>
<ss>From <DATE> of our administration, <PERSON> has been intensely involved in the effort to fight drug abuse</ss>
<ss>She has since <QUANTITY> to 55 cities in 28 States and 6 foreign countries to fight school-age drug and alcohol abuse</ss>
<ss>She's given dozens of speeches and scores of interviews and has participated in 24 special radio and TV tapings to create greater awareness of this crisis</ss>
<ss>Her personal observations and efforts have given her such dramatic insights that I wanted her to share them with you <TIME></ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>Mrs</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss>As a mother, I've always thought of <DATE> as <DATE>, a time when we bundled our children off to school, to the warmth of an environment in which they could fulfill the promise and hope in those restless minds</ss>
<ss>But so much has happened over <DATE>, so much to shake the foundations of all that we know and all that we believe in</ss>
<ss><DATE> there's a drug and alcohol abuse epidemic in this country, and no one is safe from it -- not you, not me, and certainly not our children, because this epidemic has their names written on it</ss>
<ss>Many of you may be thinking: "Well, drugs don't concern me</ss>
<ss>" But it does concern you</ss>
<ss>It concerns us all because of the way it tears at our lives and because it's aimed at destroying the brightness and life of the sons and daughters of the United States</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> I've been traveling across the country -- learning and listening</ss>
<ss>And one of the most hopeful signs I've seen is the building of an essential, new awareness of how terrible and threatening drug abuse is to our society</ss>
<ss>This was one of the main purposes when I started, so of course it makes me happy that that's been accomplished</ss>
<ss>But each time I meet with someone new or receive another letter from a troubled person on drugs, I yearn to find a way to help share the message that cries out from them</ss>
<ss>As a parent, I'm especially concerned about what drugs are doing to young mothers and their newborn children</ss>
<ss>Listen to this news account from a hospital in Florida of a child born to a mother with a cocaine habit: "Nearby, a baby named <PERSON> lies motionless in an incubator, feeding tubes riddling his tiny body</ss>
<ss>He needs a respirator to breathe and a <DATE> spinal tap to relieve fluid buildup on his brain</ss>
<ss><DATE>, he's already suffered 2 strokes</ss>
<ss>" Now you can see why drug abuse concerns every one of us -- all the <NORP> family</ss>
<ss>Drugs steal away so much</ss>
<ss>They take and take, until finally every time a drug goes into a child, something else is forced out -- like love and hope and trust and confidence</ss>
<ss>Drugs take away the dream from every child's heart and replace it with a nightmare, and it's time we in America stand up and replace those dreams</ss>
<ss>Each of us has to put our principles and consciences on the line, whether in social settings or in the workplace, to set forth solid standards and stick to them</ss>
<ss>There's no moral middle ground</ss>
<ss>Indifference is not an option</ss>
<ss>We want you to help us create an outspoken intolerance for drug use</ss>
<ss>For the sake of our children, I implore each of you to be unyielding and inflexible in your opposition to drugs</ss>
<ss>Our young people are helping us lead the way</ss>
<ss>Not long ago, in Oakland, California, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs, and I answered, "Just say no</ss>
<ss>" Soon after that, those children in Oakland formed a Just Say No club, and now there are over 10,000 such clubs all over the country</ss>
<ss>Well, their participation and their courage in saying no needs our encouragement</ss>
<ss>We can help by using every opportunity to force the issue of not using drugs to the point of making others uncomfortable, even if it means making ourselves unpopular</ss>
<ss>Our job is never easy because drug criminals are ingenious</ss>
<ss>They work everyday to plot a new and better way to steal our children's lives, just as they've done by developing this new drug, crack</ss>
<ss>For every door that we close, they open a new door to death</ss>
<ss>They prosper on our unwillingness to act</ss>
<ss>So, we must be smarter and stronger and tougher than they are</ss>
<ss>It's up to us to change attitudes and just simply dry up their markets</ss>
<ss>And finally, to young people watching or listening, I have a very personal message for you: There's a big, wonderful world out there for you</ss>
<ss>It belongs to you</ss>
<ss>It's exciting and stimulating and rewarding</ss>
<ss>Don't cheat yourselves out of this promise</ss>
<ss>Our country needs you, but it needs you to be clear-eyed and clear-minded</ss>
<ss>I recently read one teenager's story</ss>
<ss>She's now determined to stay clean but was once strung out on several drugs</ss>
<ss>What she remembered most clearly about her recovery was that during the time she was on drugs everything appeared to her in shades of black and gray and after her treatment she was able to see colors again</ss>
<ss>So, to my young friends out there: Life can be great, but not when you can't see it</ss>
<ss>So, open your eyes to life: to see it in the vivid colors that <PERSON> gave us as a precious gift to His children, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to make it count</ss>
<ss>Say yes to your life</ss>
<ss>And when it comes to drugs and alcohol just say no</ss>
<ss>The President</ss>
<ss>I think you can see why <PERSON> has been such a positive influence on all that we're trying to do</ss>
<ss>The job ahead of us is very clear</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s personal crusade, like that of so many other wonderful individuals, should become our national crusade</ss>
<ss>It must include a combination of government and private efforts which complement one another</ss>
<ss><DATE> I announced six initiatives which we believe will do just that</ss>
<ss>First, we seek a drug-free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we'll work toward drug-free schools</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we want to ensure that the public is protected and that treatment is available to substance abusers and the chemically dependent</ss>
<ss>Our <ORDINAL> goal is to expand international cooperation while treating drug trafficking as a threat to our national security</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> will be meeting with key U</ss>
<ss>S</ss>
<ss>Ambassadors to discuss what can be done to support our friends abroad</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we must move to strengthen law enforcement activities such as those initiated by Vice President <PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON></ss>
<ss>And finally, we seek to expand public awareness and prevention</ss>
<ss>In order to further implement these six goals, I will announce <DATE> a series of new proposals for a drug-free America</ss>
<ss>Taken as a whole, these proposals will toughen our laws against drug criminals, encourage more research and treatment, and ensure that illegal drugs will not be tolerated in our schools or in our workplaces</ss>
<ss>Together with our ongoing efforts, these proposals will bring the Federal commitment to fighting drugs to <MONEY></ss>
<ss>As much financing as we commit, however, we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that massive new amounts of money alone will provide the solution</ss>
<ss>Let us not forget that in America people solve problems and no national crusade has ever succeeded without human investment</ss>
<ss>Winning the crusade against drugs will not be achieved by just throwing money at the problem</ss>
<ss>Your government will continue to act aggressively, but nothing would be more effective than for <NORP> simply to quit using illegal drugs</ss>
<ss>We seek to create a massive change in national attitudes which ultimately will separate the drugs from the customer, to take the user away from the supply</ss>
<ss>I believe, quite simply, that we can help them quit, and that's where you come in</ss>
<ss>My generation will remember how America swung into action when we were attacked in <EVENT></ss>
<ss>The war was not just fought by the fellows flying the planes or driving the tanks</ss>
<ss>It was fought at home by a mobilized nation -- men and women alike -- building planes and ships, clothing sailors and soldiers, feeding <NORP> and airmen; and it was fought by children planting victory gardens and collecting cans</ss>
<ss>Well, now we're in another war for our freedom, and it's time for all of us to pull together again</ss>
<ss>So, for example, if your friend or neighbor or a family member has a drug or alcohol problem, don't turn the other way</ss>
<ss>Go to his help or to hers</ss>
<ss>Get others involved with you -- clubs, service groups, and community organizations -- and provide support and strength</ss>
<ss>And, of course, many of you've been cured through treatment and self-help</ss>
<ss>Well, you're the combat veterans, and you have a critical role to play</ss>
<ss>You can help others by telling your story and providing a willing hand to those in need</ss>
<ss>Being friends to others is the best way of being friends to ourselves</ss>
<ss>It's time, as <PERSON> said, for America to "just say no" to drugs</ss>
<ss>Those of you in union halls and workplaces everywhere: Please make this challenge a part of your job every day</ss>
<ss>Help us preserve the health and dignity of all workers</ss>
<ss>To businesses large and small: We need the creativity of your enterprise applied directly to this national problem</ss>
<ss>Help us</ss>
<ss>And those of you who are educators: Your wisdom and leadership are indispensable to this cause</ss>
<ss>From the pulpits of this spirit-filled land: We would welcome your reassuring message of redemption and forgiveness and of helping one another</ss>
<ss>On the athletic fields: You men and women are among the most beloved citizens of our country</ss>
<ss>A child's eyes fill with your heroic achievements</ss>
<ss>Few of us can give youngsters something as special and strong to look up to as you</ss>
<ss>Please don't let them down</ss>
<ss>And this camera in front of us: It's a reminder that in <PERSON>'s and my former profession and in the newsrooms and production rooms of our media centers -- you have a special opportunity with your enormous influence to send alarm signals across the <ORG></ss>
<ss>To our friends in foreign countries: We know many of you are involved in this battle with us</ss>
<ss>We need your success as well as ours</ss>
<ss>When we all come together, united, striving for this cause, then those who are killing America and terrorizing it with slow but sure chemical destruction will see that they are up against the mightiest force for good that we know</ss>
<ss>Then they will have no dark alleyways to hide in</ss>
<ss>In this crusade, let us not forget who we are</ss>
<ss>Drug abuse is a repudiation of everything America is</ss>
<ss>The destructiveness and human wreckage mock our heritage</ss>
<ss>Think for a moment how special it is to be an <NORP></ss>
<ss>Can we doubt that only a divine providence placed this land, this island of freedom, here as a refuge for all those people on the world who yearn to breathe free? The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to an entire world seeking hope</ss>
<ss>Each new arrival of immigrants rode the crest of that hope</ss>
<ss>They came, millions seeking a safe harbor from the oppression of cruel regimes</ss>
<ss>They came, to escape starvation and disease</ss>
<ss>They came, those surviving the <EVENT> and the <NORP> gulags</ss>
<ss>They came, the boat people, chancing death for even a glimmer of hope that they could have a new life</ss>
<ss>They all came to taste the air redolent and rich with the freedom that is ours</ss>
<ss>What an insult it will be to what we are and whence we came if we do not rise up together in defiance against this cancer of drugs</ss>
<ss>And there's one more thing</ss>
<ss>The freedom that so many seek in our land has not been preserved without a price</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I shared that remembrance <DATE> at <FAC> in France</ss>
<ss>In the still of that <TIME>, we walked together among the soldiers of freedom, past the hundreds of white markers which are monuments to courage and memorials to sacrifice</ss>
<ss>Too many of these and other such graves are the final resting places of teenagers who became men in the roar of battle</ss>
<ss>Look what they gave to us who live</ss>
<ss>Never would they see <DATE> glistening off a lake or river back home or miles of corn pushing up against the open sky of our plains</ss>
<ss>The pristine air of our mountains and the driving energy of our cities are theirs no more</ss>
<ss>Nor would they ever again be a son to their parents or a father to their own children</ss>
<ss>They did this for you, for me, for a new generation to carry our <NORP> experiment proudly forward</ss>
<ss>Well, that's something I think we're obliged to honor, because what they did for us means that we owe as a simple act of civic stewardship to use our freedom wisely for the common good</ss>
<ss>As we mobilize for this national crusade, I'm mindful that drugs are a constant temptation for millions</ss>
<ss>Please remember this when your courage is tested: You are <NORP></ss>
<ss>You're the product of the freest society mankind has ever known</ss>
<ss>No one, ever, has the right to destroy your dreams and shatter your life</ss>
<ss>Right down the end of this hall is <ORG></ss>
<ss>But in <EVENT> that room was the one President <PERSON> used as his office</ss>
<ss>Memory fills that room, and more than anything that memory drives us to see vividly what President <PERSON> sought to save</ss>
<ss>Above all, it is that America must stand for something and that our heritage lets us stand with a strength of character made more steely by each layer of challenge pressed upon the <ORG></ss>
<ss>We <NORP> have never been morally neutral against any form of tyranny</ss>
<ss><TIME> we're asking no more than that we honor what we have been and what we are by standing together</ss>
<ss>Mrs</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>Now we go on to the next stop: making a final commitment not to tolerate drugs by anyone, anytime, anyplace</ss>
<ss>So, won't you join us in this great, new national crusade? The President</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and good night</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Good <TIME></ss>
<ss>As most of you know, I've just returned from meetings in Iceland with the leader of the <NORP> Union, General Secretary <PERSON></ss>
<ss>As I did <DATE> when I returned from the summit conference in Geneva, I want to take <TIME> to share with you what took place in these discussions</ss>
<ss>The implications of these talks are enormous and only just beginning to be understood</ss>
<ss>We proposed the most sweeping and generous arms control proposal in history</ss>
<ss>We offered the complete elimination of all ballistic missiles -- <NORP> and <NORP> -- from the face of the <LOC> by <DATE></ss>
<ss>While we parted company with this <NORP> offer still on the table, we are closer than ever before to agreements that could lead to a safer world without nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>But <ORDINAL>, let me tell you that from the start of my meetings with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I have always regarded you, the <NORP> people, as full participants</ss>
<ss>Believe me, without your support none of these talks could have been held, nor could the ultimate aims of <NORP> foreign policy -- world peace and freedom -- be pursued</ss>
<ss>And it's for these aims I went the extra mile to Iceland</ss>
<ss>Before I report on our talks, though, allow me to set the stage by explaining two things that were very much a part of our talks: one a treaty and the other a defense against nuclear missiles, which we're trying to develop</ss>
<ss>Now, you've heard their titles a thousand times -- the <EVENT> treaty and SDI</ss>
<ss>Well those letters stand for: <EVENT>, antiballistic missile; SDI, Strategic Defense Initiative</ss>
<ss><DATE>, the United <ORG>s and the <NORP> Union agreed to limit any defense against nuclear missile attacks to the emplacement in one location in each country of a small number of missiles capable of intercepting and shooting down incoming nuclear missiles, thus leaving our real defense -- a policy called mutual assured destruction , meaning if one side launched a nuclear attack, the other side could retaliate</ss>
<ss>And this mutual threat of destruction was believed to be a deterrent against either side striking <ORDINAL></ss>
<ss>So here we sit, with thousands of nuclear warheads targeted on each other and capable of wiping out both our countries</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> deployed the few antiballistic missiles around Moscow as the treaty permitted</ss>
<ss>Our country didn't bother deploying because the threat of nationwide annihilation made such a limited defense seem useless</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> now we've been aware that the <NORP> may be developing a nationwide defense</ss>
<ss>They have installed a large, modern radar at Krasnoyarsk, which we believe is a critical part of a radar system designed to provide radar guidance for antiballistic missiles protecting the entire nation</ss>
<ss>Now, this is a violation of the <EVENT> treaty</ss>
<ss>Believing that a policy of mutual destruction and slaughter of their citizens and ours was uncivilized, I asked our military, <DATE>, to study and see if there was a practical way to destroy nuclear missiles after their launch but before they can reach their targets, rather than to just destroy people</ss>
<ss>Well, this is the goal for what we call SDI, and our scientists researching such a system are convinced it is practical and that <DATE> down the road we can have such a system ready to deploy</ss>
<ss>Now incidentally, we are not violating the <EVENT> treaty, which permits such research</ss>
<ss>If and when we deploy the treaty -- also allows withdrawal from the treaty upon <DATE> notice</ss>
<ss>SDI, let me make it clear, is a nonnuclear defense</ss>
<ss>So, here we are at Iceland for our <ORDINAL> such meeting</ss>
<ss>In the <ORDINAL>, and in <DATE> in between, we have discussed ways to reduce and in fact eliminate nuclear weapons entirely</ss>
<ss>We and the <NORP> have had teams of negotiators in Geneva trying to work out a mutual agreement on how we could reduce or eliminate nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>And so far, no success</ss>
<ss>On <DATE> and <DATE>, General Secretary <PERSON> and his foreign minister, <PERSON>, and Secretary of <ORG> <PERSON> and I met for <TIME></ss>
<ss>We didn't limit ourselves to just arms reductions</ss>
<ss>We discussed what we call violation of human rights on the part of the <NORP> -- refusal to let people emigrate from Russia so they can practice their religion without being persecuted, letting people go to rejoin their families, husbands, and wives -- separated by national borders -- being allowed to reunite</ss>
<ss>In much of this, the <NORP> Union is violating another agreement -- the Helsinki accords they had signed in <DATE></ss>
<ss><ORG>, whose freedom we just obtained, was imprisoned for pointing out to his government its violations of that pact, its refusal to let citizens leave their country or return</ss>
<ss>We also discussed regional matters such as Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, and Cambodia</ss>
<ss>But by their choice, the main subject was arms control</ss>
<ss>We discussed the emplacement of intermediate-range missiles in <LOC> and <LOC> and seemed to be in agreement they could be drastically reduced</ss>
<ss>Both sides seemed willing to find a way to reduce, even to zero, the strategic ballistic missiles we have aimed at each other</ss>
<ss>This then brought up the subject of SDI</ss>
<ss>I offered a proposal that we continue our present research</ss>
<ss>And if and when we reached the stage of testing, we would sign, now, a treaty that would permit <NORP> observation of such tests</ss>
<ss>And if the program was practical, we would both eliminate our offensive missiles, and then we would share the benefits of advanced defenses</ss>
<ss>I explained that even though we would have done away with our offensive ballistic missiles, having the defense would protect against cheating or the possibility of a madman, sometime, deciding to create nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>After all, the world now knows how to make them</ss>
<ss>I likened it to our keeping our gas masks, even though the nations of the world had outlawed poison gas after <EVENT> We seemed to be making progress on reducing weaponry, although the General Secretary was registering opposition to SDI and proposing a pledge to observe <EVENT> for <DATE> as <DATE> was ending</ss>
<ss>Secretary <PERSON> suggested we turn over the notes our note-takers had been making of everything we'd said to our respective teams and let them work through <TIME> to put them together and find just where we were in agreement and what differences separated us</ss>
<ss>With respect and gratitude, I can inform you those teams worked through <TIME> till <DATE> <DATE>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I, with our foreign ministers, came together again and took up the report of our two teams</ss>
<ss>It was most promising</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> had asked for a 10-year delay in the deployment of SDI programs</ss>
<ss>In an effort to see how we could satisfy their concerns -- while protecting our principles and security -- we proposed a 10-year period in which we began with the reduction of all strategic nuclear arms, bombers, airlaunched cruise missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and the weapons they carry</ss>
<ss>They would be reduced <PERCENT> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>During <DATE>, we would continue by eliminating all remaining offensive ballistic missiles, of all ranges</ss>
<ss>And during that time, we would proceed with research, development, and testing of SDI -- all done in conformity with <EVENT> provisions</ss>
<ss>At the 10-year point, with all ballistic missiles eliminated, we could proceed to deploy advanced defenses, at the same time permitting the <NORP> to do likewise</ss>
<ss>And here the debate began</ss>
<ss>The General Secretary wanted wording that, in effect, would have kept us from developing the SDI for <DATE></ss>
<ss>In effect, he was killing SDI</ss>
<ss>And unless I agreed, all that work toward eliminating nuclear weapons would go down the drain -- canceled</ss>
<ss>I told him I had pledged to the <NORP> people that I would not trade away SDI, there was no way I could tell our people their government would not protect them against nuclear destruction</ss>
<ss>I went to <PERSON> determined that everything was negotiable except two things: our freedom and our future</ss>
<ss>I'm still optimistic that a way will be found</ss>
<ss>The door is open, and the opportunity to begin eliminating the nuclear threat is within reach</ss>
<ss>So you can see, we made progress in Iceland</ss>
<ss>And we will continue to make progress if we pursue a prudent, deliberate, and above all, realistic approach with the <NORP></ss>
<ss>From <DATE> of our administration this has been our policy</ss>
<ss>We made it clear we had no illusions about the <NORP> or their ultimate intentions</ss>
<ss>We were publicly candid about the critical, moral distinctions between <NORP>ism and democracy</ss>
<ss>We declared the principal objective of <NORP> foreign policy to be not just the prevention of war, but the extension of freedom</ss>
<ss>And we stressed our commitment to the growth of <NORP> government and <NORP> institutions around the world</ss>
<ss>And that's why we assisted freedom fighters who are resisting the imposition of <NORP> rule in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola, Cambodia, and elsewhere</ss>
<ss>And finally, we began work on what I believe most spurred the <NORP> to negotiate seriously: rebuilding our military strength, reconstructing our strategic deterrence, and above all, beginning work on the Strategic Defense Initiative</ss>
<ss>And yet, at the same time, we set out these foreign policy goals and began working toward them</ss>
<ss>We pursued another of our major objectives: that of seeking means to lessen tensions with the <NORP> and ways to prevent war and keep the peace</ss>
<ss>Now, this policy is now paying dividends -- one sign of this in Iceland was the progress on the issue of arms control</ss>
<ss>For the <ORDINAL> time in a long while, <NORP>-<NORP> negotiations in the area of arms reductions are moving, and moving in the right direction-not just toward arms control, but toward arms reduction</ss>
<ss>But for all the progress we made on arms reductions, we must remember there were other issues on the table in Iceland, issues that are fundamental</ss>
<ss>As I mentioned, one such issue is human rights</ss>
<ss>As President <PERSON> once said, "And is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights?" I made it plain that the United <ORG>s would not seek to exploit improvement in these matters for purposes of propaganda</ss>
<ss>But I also made it plain, once again, that an improvement of the human condition within the <NORP> Union is indispensable for an improvement in bilateral relations with the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>For a government that will break faith with its own people cannot be trusted to keep faith with foreign powers</ss>
<ss>So, I told Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> -- again in <PERSON>, as I had in Geneva -- we <NORP> place far less weight upon the words that are spoken at meetings such as these than upon the deeds that follow</ss>
<ss>When it comes to human rights and judging <NORP> intentions, we're all from Missouri -- you got to show us</ss>
<ss>Another subject area we took up in Iceland also lies at the heart of the differences between the <NORP> Union and America</ss>
<ss>This is the issue of regional conflicts</ss>
<ss>Summit meetings cannot make the <NORP> people forget what <NORP> actions have meant for the peoples of Afghanistan, <LOC>, <LOC>, and <LOC></ss>
<ss>Until <NORP> policies change, we will make sure that our friends in these areas -- those who fight for freedom and independence -- will have the support they need</ss>
<ss>Finally, there was a <ORDINAL> item</ss>
<ss>And this area was that of bilateral relations, people-to-people contacts</ss>
<ss>In Geneva <DATE>, we welcomed several cultural exchange accords; in Iceland, we saw indications of more movement in these areas</ss>
<ss>But let me say now: The United <ORG>s remains committed to people-to-people programs that could lead to exchanges between not just a few elite, but thousands of everyday citizens from both our countries</ss>
<ss>So, I think, then, that you can see that we did make progress in Iceland on a broad range of topics</ss>
<ss>We reaffirmed our fourpoint agenda</ss>
<ss>We discovered major new grounds of agreement</ss>
<ss>We probed again some old areas of disagreement</ss>
<ss>And let me return again to the SDI issue</ss>
<ss>I realize some <NORP> may be asking <TIME>: Why not accept Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s demand? Why not give up SDI for this agreement? Well, the answer, my friends, is simple</ss>
<ss>SDI is America's insurance policy that the <NORP> Union would keep the commitments made at <PERSON></ss>
<ss>SDI is America's security guarantee if the <NORP> should -- as they have done too often in the past -- fail to comply with their solemn commitments</ss>
<ss>SDI is what brought the <NORP> back to arms control talks at Geneva and Iceland</ss>
<ss>SDI is the key to a world without nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> understand this</ss>
<ss>They have devoted far more resources, for a lot longer time than we, to their own SDI</ss>
<ss>The world's only operational missile defense <DATE> surrounds Moscow, the capital of the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>What Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was demanding at <PERSON> was that the United <ORG>s agree to a new version of a 14-year-old <EVENT> treaty that the <NORP> Union has already violated</ss>
<ss>I told him we don't make those kinds of deals in the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>And the <NORP> people should reflect on these critical questions: How does a defense of the United <ORG>s threaten the <NORP> Union or anyone else? Why are the <NORP> so adamant that America remain forever vulnerable to <NORP> rocket attack? As of <DATE>, all free nations are utterly defenseless against <NORP> missiles fired either by accident or design</ss>
<ss>Why does the <NORP> Union insist that we remain so -- forever? So, my fellow <NORP>, I cannot promise, nor can any President promise, that the talks in Iceland or any future discussions with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> will lead inevitably to great breakthroughs or momentous treaty signings</ss>
<ss>We will not abandon the guiding principle we took to <PERSON></ss>
<ss>We prefer no agreement than to bring home a bad agreement to the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>And on this point, I know you're also interested in the question of whether there will be another summit</ss>
<ss>There was no indication by Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> as to when or whether he plans to travel to the United <ORG>s, as we agreed he would <DATE> in Geneva</ss>
<ss>I repeat <TIME> that our invitation stands, and that we continue to believe additional meetings would be useful</ss>
<ss>But that's a decision the <NORP> must make</ss>
<ss>But whatever the immediate prospects, I can tell you that I'm ultimately hopeful about the prospects for progress at the summit and for world peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>You see, the current summit process is very different from that of <DATE></ss>
<ss>It's different because the world is different; and the world is different because of the hard work and sacrifice of the <NORP> people during <DATE></ss>
<ss>Your energy has restored and expanded our economic might</ss>
<ss>Your support has restored our military strength</ss>
<ss>Your courage and sense of national unity in times of crisis have given pause to our adversaries, heartened our friends, and inspired the world</ss>
<ss>The Western democracies and the <ORG> alliance are revitalized; and all across the world, nations are turning to <NORP> ideas and the principles of the free market</ss>
<ss>So, because the <NORP> people stood guard at <TIME>, freedom has gathered its forces, regained its strength, and is on the march</ss>
<ss>So, if there's one impression I carry away with me from these <DATE> talks, it is that, unlike the past, we're dealing now from a position of strength</ss>
<ss>And for that reason, we have it within our grasp to move speedily with the <NORP> toward even more breakthroughs</ss>
<ss>Our ideas are out there on the table</ss>
<ss>They won't go away</ss>
<ss>We're ready to pick up where we left off</ss>
<ss>Our negotiators are heading back to Geneva, and we're prepared to go forward whenever and wherever the <NORP> are ready</ss>
<ss>So, there's reason, good reason for hope</ss>
<ss>I saw evidence of this is in the progress we made in the talks with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>And I saw evidence of it when we left Iceland <DATE>, and I spoke to our young men and women at our naval installation at Keflavik -- a critically important base far closer to <NORP> naval bases than to our own coastline</ss>
<ss>As always, I was proud to spend a few moments with them and thank them for their sacrifices and devotion to country</ss>
<ss>They represent America at her finest: committed to defend not only our own freedom but the freedom of others who would be living in a far more frightening world were it not for the strength and resolve of the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>"Whenever the standard of freedom and independence has been</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>unfurled, there will be America's heart, her benedictions, and her prayers," <PERSON> once said</ss>
<ss>He spoke well of our destiny as a nation</ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>, we're honored by history, entrusted by destiny with the oldest dream of humanity-the dream of lasting peace and human freedom</ss>
<ss>Another President, <PERSON>, noted that <DATE> had seen two of the most frightful wars in history and that "the supreme need of our time is for man to learn to live together in peace and harmony</ss>
<ss>" It's in pursuit of that ideal I went to Geneva <DATE> and to Iceland <DATE></ss>
<ss>And it's in pursuit of that ideal that I thank you now for all the support you've given me, and I again ask for your help and your prayers as we continue our journey toward a world where peace reigns and freedom is enshrined</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and <PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Thank you all, please be seated</ss>
<ss>Well, thank you, and welcome to <ORG></ss>
<ss>In a moment I'll be sitting at that desk, taking up a pen, and signing the most sweeping overhaul of our tax code in our nation's history</ss>
<ss>To all of you here <DATE> who've worked so long and hard to see <DATE> come, my thanks and the thanks of a nation go out to you</ss>
<ss>The journey's been long, and many said we'd never make it to the end</ss>
<ss>But as usual the pessimists left one thing out of their calculations: the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>They haven't made this the freest country and the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges</ss>
<ss>They never gave up</ss>
<ss>And after <DATE> of commitment and hard work, one headline in <ORG> told the whole story: "<WORK_OF_ART>," and the dream of America's fair-share tax plan became a reality</ss>
<ss>When I sign this bill into law, America will have the lowest marginal tax rates and the most modern tax code among major industrialized nations, one that encourages risk-taking, innovation, and that old <NORP> spirit of enterprise</ss>
<ss>We'll be refueling the <NORP> growth economy with the kind of incentives that helped create record new businesses and nearly 11</ss>
<ss>7 million jobs in <DATE></ss>
<ss><ORG> and simpler for most <NORP>, this is a tax code designed to take us into a future of technological invention and economic achievement, one that will keep America competitive and growing into <DATE></ss>
<ss>But for all tax reform's economic benefits, I believe that history will record this moment as something more: as the return to the <ORDINAL> principles</ss>
<ss>This country was founded on faith in the individual, not groups or classes, but faith in the resources and bounty of each and every separate human soul</ss>
<ss>Our <ORG> designed a democratic form of government to enlist the individual's energies and fashioned a <LAW> to protect its freedoms</ss>
<ss>And in so doing, they tapped a wellspring of hope and creativity that was to completely transform history</ss>
<ss>The history of these United States of America is indeed a history of individual achievement</ss>
<ss>It was their hard work that built our cities and farmed our prairies; their genius that continually pushed us beyond the boundaries of existing knowledge, reshaping our world with the steam engine, polio vaccine, and the silicon chip</ss>
<ss>It was their faith in freedom and love of country that sustained us through trials and hardships and through wars, and it was their courage and selflessness that enabled us to always prevail</ss>
<ss>But when our <ORG> designed this government -- of, by, and for the people -- they never imagined what we've come to know as the progressive income tax</ss>
<ss>When the income tax was <ORDINAL> levied in <DATE>, the top rate was <PERCENT> on people with incomes <MONEY></ss>
<ss>Now, that's the equivalent of multimillionaires <DATE></ss>
<ss>But in our lifetime we've seen marginal tax rates skyrocket <PERCENT>, and not even the poor have been spared</ss>
<ss>As tax rates escalated, the tax code grew ever more tangled and complex, a haven for special interests and tax manipulators, but an impossible frustration for everybody else</ss>
<ss>Blatantly unfair, our tax code became a source of bitterness and discouragement for the average taxpayer</ss>
<ss>It wasn't too much to call it <NORP></ss>
<ss>Meanwhile, the steeply progressive nature of the tax struck at the heart of the economic life of the individual, punishing that special effort and extra hard work that has always been the driving force of our economy</ss>
<ss>As government's hunger for ever more revenues expanded, families saw tax cuts -- or taxes, I should say, cut deeper and deeper into their paychecks; and taxation fell most cruelly on the poor, making a difficult climb up from poverty even harder</ss>
<ss>Throughout history, the oppressive hand of government has fallen most heavily on the economic life of the individuals</ss>
<ss>And more often than not, it is inflation and taxes that have undermined livelihoods and constrained their freedoms</ss>
<ss>We should not forget that this nation of ours began in a revolt against oppressive taxation</ss>
<ss>Our <ORG> fought not only for our political rights but also to secure the economic freedoms without which these political freedoms are no more than a shadow</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> we've witnessed an expansion and strengthening of many of our civil liberties, but our economic liberties have too often been neglected and even abused</ss>
<ss>We protect the freedom of expression of the author, as we should, but what of the freedom of expression of the entrepreneur, whose pen and paper are capital and profits, whose book may be a new invention or small business? What of the creators of our economic life, whose contributions may not only delight the mind but improve the condition of man by feeding the poor with new grains, bringing hope to the sick with new cures, vanishing ignorance with wondrous new information technologies? And what about fairness for families? It's in our families that America's most important work gets done: raising our next generation</ss>
<ss>But over <DATE>, as inflation has shrunk the personal exemption, families with children have had to shoulder more and more of the tax burden</ss>
<ss>With inflation and bracket-creep also eroding incomes, many spouses who would rather stay home with their children have been forced to go looking for jobs</ss>
<ss>And what of America's promise of hope and opportunity, that with hard work even the poorest among us can gain the security and happiness that is the due of all <NORP>? You can't put a price tag on the <NORP> dream</ss>
<ss>That dream is the heart and soul of America; it's the promise that keeps our nation forever good and generous, a model and hope to the world</ss>
<ss>For all these reasons, this tax bill is less a freedom -- or a reform, I should say, than a revolution</ss>
<ss>Millions of working poor will be dropped from the tax rolls altogether, and families will get a long-overdue break with lower rates and an almost doubled personal exemption</ss>
<ss>We're going to make it economical to raise children again</ss>
<ss>Flatter rates will mean more reward for that extra effort, and vanishing loopholes and a minimum tax will mean that everybody and every corporation pay their fair share</ss>
<ss>And that's why I'm certain that the bill I'm signing <DATE> is not only an historic overhaul of our tax code and a sweeping victory for fairness, it's also the best antipoverty bill, the best profamily measure, and the best job-creation program ever to come out of <ORG></ss>
<ss>And now that we've come this far, we cannot, and we will not, allow tax reform to be undone with tax rate hikes</ss>
<ss>We must restore certainty to our tax code and our economy</ss>
<ss>And I'll oppose with all my might any attempt to raise tax rates on the <NORP> people, and I hope that all here will join with me to make permanent the historic progress of tax reform</ss>
<ss>I think all of us here <DATE> know what a <NORP> effort it took to get this landmark bill to my desk</ss>
<ss>That effort didn't start here in Washington, but began with the many thinkers who have struggled to return economics to its classical roots -- to an understanding that ultimately the economy is not made up of aggregates like government spending and consumer demand, but of individual men and women, each striving to provide for his family and better his or her lot in life</ss>
<ss>But we must also salute those courageous leaders in the <ORG> who've made <DATE> possible</ss>
<ss>To <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and Majority Leader <PERSON>; to <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>, who pioneered with their own versions of tax reform -- I salute all of you and all the other Members of the <ORG> and <ORG> whose efforts paid off and whose votes finally won <DATE></ss>
<ss>And last but not least, the many members of the administration who must often have felt that they were fighting a lonely battle against overwhelming odds -- particularly my two incomparable Secretaries of the <ORG>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> -- and I thank them from the bottom of my heart</ss>
<ss>I feel like we just played <EVENT> of tax reform --  -- and the <NORP> people won</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, distinguished Members of <ORG>, honored guests, and fellow citizens: May I congratulate all of you who are Members of this historic <ORG> of the United <ORG>s of America</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> of our <LAW>, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants -- men whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom</ss>
<ss>However, we must always remember that our <LAW> is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young -- young with the same energy, spirit, and promise that filled each eventful day in Philadelphia's statehouse</ss>
<ss>We will be guided <TIME> by their acts, and we will be guided forever by their words</ss>
<ss>Now, forgive me, but I can't resist sharing a story from <DATE></ss>
<ss>Philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in <DATE>, and its newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the <PRODUCT> delegates with elaborate social classifications</ss>
<ss>Governors of <ORG>s were called Excellency</ss>
<ss>Justices and <ORG> had reserved for them honorable with a capital "H</ss>
<ss>" For <ORG>men, it was honorable with a small "h</ss>
<ss>" And all others were referred to as "the following respectable characters</ss>
<ss>" Well, for this <ORG>, I invoke special executive powers to declare that each of you must never be titled less than honorable with a capital "H</ss>
<ss>" Incidentally, I'm delighted you are celebrating the <ORDINAL> birthday of the <ORG></ss>
<ss>It's always a pleasure to congratulate someone with more birth<DATE> than I've had</ss>
<ss>Now, there's a new face at this place of honor <TIME></ss>
<ss>And please join me in warm congratulations to the <PERSON> of the <ORG>, <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, you might recall a similar situation in your very <ORDINAL> session of <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>Then, as now, the speakership had changed hands and another great son of Texas, <PERSON> -- "Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>" -- sat in your chair</ss>
<ss>I cannot find better words than those used by <PERSON> <PERSON> that <TIME></ss>
<ss>He said, "We shall have much to do together; I am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and good will</ss>
<ss>" <TIME> I renew that pledge</ss>
<ss>To you, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, and to <ORG> Majority Leader <PERSON>, who brings <DATE> of distinguished service to the <ORG>, may I say: Though there are changes in the <ORG>, America's interests remain the same</ss>
<ss>And I am confident that, along with <NORP> leaders <PERSON> and <PERSON>, this <ORG> can make history</ss>
<ss><DATE> I was here to ask the <ORG> to join me in America's new beginning</ss>
<ss>Well, the results are something of which we can all be proud</ss>
<ss>Our inflation rate is now the lowest in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The prime interest rate has fallen from the <PERCENT> <DATE> before we took office to <PERCENT> <DATE></ss>
<ss>And those rates have triggered the most housing starts in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The unemployment rate -- still too high -- is the lowest in <DATE>, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs</ss>
<ss><PERCENT> of everyone over <DATE>, male and female, is employed -- the highest percentage on record</ss>
<ss>Let's roll up our sleeves and go to work and put America's economic engine at full throttle</ss>
<ss>We can also be heartened by our progress across the world</ss>
<ss>Most important, America is at peace <TIME>, and freedom is on the march</ss>
<ss>And we've done much <DATE> to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world</ss>
<ss>Our sons and daughters in the services once again wear their uniforms with pride</ss>
<ss>But though we've made much progress, I have one major regret: I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran</ss>
<ss>It did not work, and for that I assume full responsibility</ss>
<ss>The goals were worthy</ss>
<ss>I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives</ss>
<ss>And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity</ss>
<ss>But we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so</ss>
<ss>We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for</ss>
<ss>But in debating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future</ss>
<ss>Let it never be said of this generation of <NORP> that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world</ss>
<ss>Much is at stake here, and the <ORG> and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us</ss>
<ss>And let there be no mistake about <NORP> policy: We will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in <LOC> are threatened, nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail</ss>
<ss>And now, ladies and gentlemen of the <ORG>, why don't we get to work? I am pleased to report that because of our efforts to rebuild the strength of America, the world is a safer place</ss>
<ss><DATE> I submitted a budget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, I ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says yes to protecting our country</ss>
<ss>While the world is safer, it is not safe</ss>
<ss>Since <DATE> the <NORP> have invested <MONEY> more on their military forces than we have</ss>
<ss>Even <DATE>, though nearly 1 in 3 <NORP> families is without running hot water and the average family spends <TIME> a day shopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found the resources to transfer <MONEY> in weapons to client states in <DATE> -- clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia, <NORP>istan, and Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>With 120,000 <NORP> combat and military personnel and 15,000 military advisers in <LOC>, <LOC>, and <LOC>, can anyone still doubt their single-minded determination to expand their power? Despite this, the <ORG> cut my request for critical <PERSON> security assistance to free nations by <PERCENT> <DATE>, and cut defense requests by <MONEY> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>These assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual interests</ss>
<ss>And when the programs are devastated, <NORP> interests are harmed</ss>
<ss>My friends, it's my duty as <PERSON> to say to you again <TIME> that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve</ss>
<ss><DATE> the brave people of <NORP>istan are showing that resolve</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> Union says it wants a peaceful settlement in <NORP>istan, yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose <DATE> are clearly numbered</ss>
<ss>We are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all <NORP> troops and genuine self-determination for the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>In <LOC>, too, the cause of freedom is being tested</ss>
<ss>And our resolve is being tested there as well</ss>
<ss>Here, especially, the world is watching to see how this nation responds</ss>
<ss><DATE> over <PERCENT> of the people of <LOC> live in democracy</ss>
<ss>Democracy is on the march in <LOC></ss>
<ss><NORP> Nicaragua is the odd man out -- suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent and promoting subversion in the region</ss>
<ss>We support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the <NORP> win their war against the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>Our commitment to a <LOC> safe from aggression did not occur by spontaneous generation on <DATE> that we took office</ss>
<ss>It began with the Monroe Doctrine in <DATE> and continues our historic bipartisan <NORP> policy</ss>
<ss><PERSON> said we "are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere</ss>
<ss>" <PERSON> <PERSON> was very blunt: "International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>We cannot let that happen here</ss>
<ss>" And <PERSON> made clear that "<NORP> domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiated</ss>
<ss>" Some in this <ORG> may choose to depart from this historic commitment, but I will not</ss>
<ss><DATE> we celebrate <DATE> of our <LAW></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> just signed theirs <DATE>, and then suspended it</ss>
<ss>We won't know how my words <TIME> will be reported there for one simple reason: There is no free press in Nicaragua</ss>
<ss><NORP> freedom fighters have never asked us to wage their battle, but I will fight any effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without freedom</ss>
<ss>There must be no <NORP> beachhead in <LOC></ss>
<ss>You know, we <NORP> have always preferred dialog to conflict, and so, we always remain open to more constructive relations with the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>But more responsible <NORP> conduct around the world is a key element of the <PERSON>-<NORP> agenda</ss>
<ss>Progress is also required on the other items of our agenda as well -- real respect for human rights and more open contacts between our societies and, of course, arms reduction</ss>
<ss>In Iceland, <DATE>, we had <QUANTITY> of opportunity that the <NORP> dashed because they sought to cripple our Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI</ss>
<ss>I wouldn't let them do it then; I won't let them do it now or in the future</ss>
<ss>This is the most positive and promising defense program we have undertaken</ss>
<ss>It's the path, for both sides, to a safer future -- a system that defends human life instead of threatening it</ss>
<ss>SDI will go forward</ss>
<ss>The United <ORG>s has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the <NORP> Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction</ss>
<ss>But I will need, and <NORP> negotiators in Geneva will need, <ORG>' support</ss>
<ss>Enacting the <NORP> negotiating position into <NORP> law would not be the way to win a good agreement</ss>
<ss>So, I must tell you in this <ORG> I will veto any effort that undercuts our national security and our negotiating leverage</ss>
<ss>Now, <DATE>, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerce across the world</ss>
<ss>We will work to expand our opportunities in international markets through the Uruguay round of trade negotiations and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world's two largest trading partners, Canada and the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>Our basic trade policy remains the same: We remain opposed as ever to protectionism, because America's growth and future depend on trade</ss>
<ss>But we would insist on trade that is fair and free</ss>
<ss>We are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies</ss>
<ss>Now, from foreign borders let us return to our own, because America in the world is only as strong as America at home</ss>
<ss>This <ORG> has high responsibilities</ss>
<ss>I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people deserve to be impatient, because we do not yet have the public house in order</ss>
<ss>We've had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we've rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the <EVENT></ss>
<ss>But there's more to do</ss>
<ss>For starters, the <ORG> deficit is outrageous</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> I've asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of our government</ss>
<ss>And what the <ORG> finally needs to do is pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces government to live within its means</ss>
<ss><ORG>s, cities, and the families of America balance their budgets</ss>
<ss>Why can't we? Next, the budget process is a sorry spectacle</ss>
<ss>The missing of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing <MONEY> of spending into one bill must be stopped</ss>
<ss>We ask the <ORG> once again: Give us the same tool that 43 Governors have -- a lineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork, those items that would never survive on their own</ss>
<ss>I will send the <ORG> broad recommendations on the budget, but <ORDINAL> I'd like to see yours</ss>
<ss>Let's go to work and get this done together</ss>
<ss>But now let's talk about <DATE>'s budget</ss>
<ss>Even though I have submitted it within the <LAW> deficit reduction target, I have seen suggestions that we might postpone that timetable</ss>
<ss>Well, I think the <NORP> people are tired of hearing the same old excuses</ss>
<ss>Together we made a commitment to balance the budget</ss>
<ss>Now let's keep it</ss>
<ss>As for those suggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the <NORP> people have repeatedly rejected that shop-worn advice</ss>
<ss>They know that we don't have deficits because people are taxed too little</ss>
<ss>We have deficits because big government spends too much</ss>
<ss>Now, <DATE> I'll place two additional reforms before the <ORG></ss>
<ss>We've created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities</ss>
<ss>Our national welfare system consists of some 59 major programs and over 6,000 pages of <ORG> laws and regulations on which <MONEY> was spent in <DATE></ss>
<ss>I will propose a new national welfare strategy, a program of welfare reform through <ORG>-sponsored, community-based demonstration projects</ss>
<ss>This is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap</ss>
<ss>Now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help</ss>
<ss>But let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare and made self-supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipients want more than anything else</ss>
<ss>Next, let us remove a financial specter facing our older <NORP>: the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death</ss>
<ss>I will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness</ss>
<ss>Now let's turn to the future</ss>
<ss>It's widely said that America is losing her competitive edge</ss>
<ss>Well, that won't happen if we act now</ss>
<ss>How well prepared are we to enter <DATE>? In my lifetime, America set the standard for the world</ss>
<ss>It is now time to determine that we should enter <DATE> having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history</ss>
<ss>We will achieve this, <ORDINAL>, by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote America's ability to compete</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding</ss>
<ss>Rather, it involves an expenditure of <NORP> spirit and just plain <NORP> grit</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness, including new science and technology centers and strong new funding for basic research</ss>
<ss>The bill will include legal and regulatory reforms and weapons to fight unfair trade practices</ss>
<ss>Competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market</ss>
<ss>Preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children</ss>
<ss>We need to set for them new and more rigorous goals</ss>
<ss>We must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our children should master the basic concepts of math and science, and let's insist that students not leave high school until they have studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage</ss>
<ss>There's one more thing we can't let up on: Let's redouble our personal efforts to provide for every child a safe and drug-free learning environment</ss>
<ss>If our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, we will defeat that scourge all over the country</ss>
<ss>Finally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being</ss>
<ss>Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help</ss>
<ss>Why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can't use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer? The <ORG> of the United <ORG>s should be remembered as the one that ended the expulsion of God from America's classrooms</ss>
<ss>The quest for excellence into <DATE> begins in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace</ss>
<ss>More than 20 million new jobs will be created before <DATE> unfolds, and by then, our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work</ss>
<ss>We must also enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace</ss>
<ss>And I will propose substantial, new <ORG> commitments keyed to retraining and job mobility</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, I'll be sending the <ORG> a complete series of these special messages -- on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness, including education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture, and other subjects</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just being our best</ss>
<ss>And that is the core of <NORP> greatness</ss>
<ss>The responsibility of freedom presses us towards higher knowledge and, I believe, moral and spiritual greatness</ss>
<ss>Through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of freeing people's spirits</ss>
<ss>But only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar against our own individual standards</ss>
<ss>Excellence is what makes freedom ring</ss>
<ss>And isn't that what we do best? We're entering <DATE> now, but it's wrong to judge our nation by its <DATE></ss>
<ss>The calendar can't measure America because we were meant to be an endless experiment in freedom -- with no limit to our reaches, no boundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes</ss>
<ss>The United <ORG>s <LAW> is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history</ss>
<ss>It grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence: that we are here to serve Him by living free -- that living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities; that we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would secure them not just for ourselves and for our children but for all mankind</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE> -- I won't count if you don't -- nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to America's young, and the little ones especially, so fresh-faced and so eager to know</ss>
<ss>Well, from time to time I've been with them -- they will ask about our <LAW></ss>
<ss>And I hope you Members of <ORG> will not deem this a breach of protocol if you'll permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching <TIME></ss>
<ss>I've read the constitutions of a number of countries, including the <NORP> Union's</ss>
<ss>Now, some people are surprised to hear that they have a constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people</ss>
<ss>Many countries have written into their constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly</ss>
<ss>Well, if this is true, why is <LAW> so exceptional? Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it's so great it tells you the whole story in just three words: We the people</ss>
<ss>In those other constitutions, the Government tells the people of those countries what they're allowed to do</ss>
<ss>In our <LAW>, we the people tell the Government what it can do, and it can do only those things listed in that document and no others</ss>
<ss>Virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers</ss>
<ss>Our revolution is the <ORDINAL> to say the people are the masters and government is their servant</ss>
<ss>And you young people out there, don't ever forget that</ss>
<ss>Someday you could be in this room, but wherever you are, America is depending on you to reach your highest and be your best -- because here in America, we the people are in charge</ss>
<ss>Just three words: We the people -- those are the kids on <DATE> looking out from a frozen sentry post on the <ORDINAL> parallel in Korea or aboard an aircraft carrier in the <LOC></ss>
<ss><QUANTITY> from home, but doing their duty</ss>
<ss>We the people -- those are the warmhearted whose numbers we can't begin to count, who'll begin <DATE> with a little prayer for hostages they will never know and <ORG> families they will never meet</ss>
<ss>Why? Because that's the way we are, this unique breed we call <NORP></ss>
<ss>We the people -- they're farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a hungry world</ss>
<ss>They're the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life because of a mother who used drugs</ss>
<ss>And you'll forgive me a special memory -- it's a million mothers like <PERSON> who never knew a stranger or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door</ss>
<ss>We the people -- they refute <DATE> television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism</ss>
<ss>They are the entrepreneurs, the builders, the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks -- the true heroes of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history</ss>
<ss>You know they're <NORP> because their spirit is as big as the universe and their hearts are bigger than their spirits</ss>
<ss>We the people -- starting <DATE> of a dream and standing up to some cynic who's trying to tell us we're not going to get any better</ss>
<ss>Are we at the end? Well, I can't tell it any better than the real thing -- a story recorded by <PERSON> from the final moments of <LAW>, <DATE></ss>
<ss>As the last few members signed the document, <PERSON> -- the oldest delegate at <DATE> and in frail health -- looked over toward the chair where <PERSON> <DATE> presided</ss>
<ss>At the back of the chair was painted the picture of a <ORG> on the horizon</ss>
<ss>And turning to those sitting next to him, <PERSON> observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a rising and a setting <ORG></ss>
<ss>Well, I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around <PERSON>-leaning in to listen more closely to him</ss>
<ss>And then Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their efforts, and this is what he said: "I have often looked at that picture behind the <PERSON> without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting <ORG>: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting <ORG></ss>
<ss>" Well, you can bet it's rising because, my fellow citizens, America isn't finished</ss>
<ss>Her best <DATE> have just begun</ss>
<ss>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss>Chancellor <PERSON>, Governing Mayor <PERSON>, ladies and gentlemen: <DATE>, President <PERSON> visited Berlin, speaking to the people of this city and the world at the city hall</ss>
<ss>Well, since then two other presidents have come, each in his turn, to Berlin</ss>
<ss>And <DATE> I, myself, make my <ORDINAL> visit to your city</ss>
<ss>We come to Berlin, we <NORP> Presidents, because it's our duty to speak, in this place, of freedom</ss>
<ss>But I must confess, we're drawn here by other things as well: by the feeling of history in this city, <DATE> older than our own nation; by the beauty of the <PERSON> and the <PERSON>; most of all, by your courage and determination</ss>
<ss>Perhaps the composer, <PERSON>, understood something about <NORP> Presidents</ss>
<ss>You see, like so many Presidents before me, I come here <DATE> because wherever I go, whatever I do: "Ich hab <TIME> koffer in Berlin</ss>
<ss>"  Our gathering <DATE> is being broadcast throughout <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the <LOC></ss>
<ss>To those listening throughout <LOC>, I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>To those listening in <LOC> Berlin, a special word: Although I cannot be with you, I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before me</ss>
<ss>For I join you, as I join your fellow countrymen in the <LOC>, in this firm, this unalterable belief: Es gibt nur ein Berlin</ss>
<ss>Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of <LOC></ss>
<ss>From the <LOC>, south, those barriers cut across <NORP>y in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs, and guardtowers</ss>
<ss>Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall</ss>
<ss>But there remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same -- still a restriction on the right to travel, still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women the will of a <NORP> state</ss>
<ss>Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most clearly; here, cutting across your city, where the news photo and the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world</ss>
<ss>Standing before <ORG>, every man is a <NORP>, separated from his fellow men</ss>
<ss>Every man is a <PERSON>, forced to look upon a scar</ss>
<ss>President <PERSON> has said: "The <NORP> question is open as long as <ORG> is closed</ss>
<ss>" <DATE> I say: As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the <NORP> question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind</ss>
<ss>Yet I do not come here to lament</ss>
<ss>For I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a message of triumph</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> in <DATE>, the people of Berlin emerged from their air raid shelters to find devastation</ss>
<ss><QUANTITY> away, the people of the United <ORG>s reached out to help</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE> Secretary of <ORG> -- as you've been told -- <PERSON> announced the creation of what would become known as <ORG></ss>
<ss>Speaking precisely <DATE>, he said: "Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos</ss>
<ss>" In the <PRODUCT> <TIME>, I saw a display commemorating <DATE> of <ORG></ss>
<ss>I was struck by the sign on a burnt-out, gutted structure that was being rebuilt</ss>
<ss>I understand that <ORG> of my own generation can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the <NORP> sectors of the city</ss>
<ss>The sign read simply: "<WORK_OF_ART> is helping here to strengthen the free world</ss>
<ss>" A strong, free world in the <LOC>, that dream became real</ss>
<ss>Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant</ss>
<ss>Italy , France , Belgium -- virtually every nation in <LOC> saw political and economic rebirth; <ORG> was founded</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> <NORP>y and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle, the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Adenauer, <ORG>, and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty -- that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech, so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> leaders reduced tariffs, expanded free trade, lowered taxes</ss>
<ss>From <DATE> alone, the standard of living in <LOC> <NORP>y and Berlin doubled</ss>
<ss>Where <DATE> there was rubble, <DATE> in <LOC> Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in <NORP>y -- busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues, and the spreading lawns of park land</ss>
<ss>Where a city's culture seemed to have been destroyed, <DATE> there are two great universities, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters, and museums</ss>
<ss>Where there was want, <DATE> there's abundance -- food, clothing, automobiles -- the wonderful goods of the <PERSON></ss>
<ss>From devastation, from utter ruin, you <ORG> have, in freedom, rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> may have had other plans</ss>
<ss>But, my friends, there were a few things the <NORP> didn't count on <PERSON> herz, <PERSON> humor, ja, und <PERSON> schnauze</ss>
<ss>In <DATE>, <ORG> predicted: "We will bury you</ss>
<ss>" But in the <LOC> <DATE>, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history</ss>
<ss>In the <NORP> world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind -- too little food</ss>
<ss>Even <DATE>, the <NORP> Union still cannot feed itself</ss>
<ss>After <DATE>, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity</ss>
<ss>Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace</ss>
<ss>Freedom is the victor</ss>
<ss>And now the <NORP> themselves may, in a limited way, be coming to understand the importance of freedom</ss>
<ss>We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness</ss>
<ss>Some political prisoners have been released</ss>
<ss>Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed</ss>
<ss>Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control</ss>
<ss>Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the <NORP> state? Or are they token gestures, intended to raise false hopes in the <LOC>, or to strengthen the <NORP> system without changing it? We welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace</ss>
<ss>There is one sign the <NORP> can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace</ss>
<ss><ORG> Secretary <PERSON>, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the <NORP> Union and <LOC>, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, open this gate! Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, tear down this wall! I understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent -- and I pledge to you my country's efforts to help overcome these burdens</ss>
<ss>To be sure, we in the <LOC> must resist <NORP> expansion</ss>
<ss>So we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength</ss>
<ss>Yet we seek peace; so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides</ss>
<ss>Beginning <DATE>, the <NORP> challenged the <NORP> alliance with a grave new threat, hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20 nuclear missiles, capable of striking every capital in <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> alliance responded by committing itself to a counterdeployment unless the <NORP> agreed to negotiate a better solution; namely, the elimination of such weapons on both sides</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, the <NORP> refused to bargain in earnestness</ss>
<ss>As the alliance, in turn, prepared to go forward with its counterdeployment, there were difficult <DATE> -- <DATE> of protests like those during my <DATE> visit to this city -- and the <NORP> later walked away from the table</ss>
<ss>But through it all, the alliance held firm</ss>
<ss>And I invite those who protested then -- I invite those who protest <DATE> -- to mark this fact: Because we remained strong, the <NORP> came back to the table</ss>
<ss>And because we remained strong, <DATE> we have within reach the possibility, not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the <ORDINAL> time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>As I speak, <ORG> ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons</ss>
<ss>At the talks in Geneva, we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons</ss>
<ss>And the <NORP> allies have likewise made far-reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons</ss>
<ss>While we pursue these arms reductions, I pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter <NORP> aggression at any level at which it might occur</ss>
<ss>And in cooperation with many of our allies, the United <ORG>s is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative -- research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation, but on defenses that truly defend; on systems, in short, that will not target populations, but shield them</ss>
<ss>By these means we seek to increase the safety of <LOC> and all the world</ss>
<ss>But we must remember a crucial fact: <LOC> and <LOC> do not mistrust each other because we are armed; we are armed because we mistrust each other</ss>
<ss>And our differences are not about weapons but about liberty</ss>
<ss>When President <PERSON> spoke at <FAC> those <DATE>, freedom was encircled, Berlin was under siege</ss>
<ss>And <DATE>, despite all the pressures upon this city, Berlin stands secure in its liberty</ss>
<ss>And freedom itself is transforming the globe</ss>
<ss>In the Philippines, in South and <LOC>, democracy has been given a rebirth</ss>
<ss>Throughout the <LOC>, free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth</ss>
<ss>In the industrialized nations, a technological revolution is taking place -- a revolution marked by rapid, dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications</ss>
<ss>In <LOC>, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom</ss>
<ss>Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the <NORP> Union faces a choice: It must make fundamental changes, or it will become obsolete</ss>
<ss><DATE> thus represents a moment of hope</ss>
<ss>We in the <LOC> stand ready to cooperate with the <LOC> to promote true openness, to break down barriers that separate people, to create a safer, freer world</ss>
<ss>And surely there is no better place than Berlin, the meeting place of <LOC> and <LOC>, to make a start</ss>
<ss>Free people of Berlin: <DATE>, as in the past, the United <ORG>s stands for the strict observance and full implementation of all parts of <LAW> of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Let us use this occasion, the <ORDINAL> anniversary of this city, to usher in a new era, to seek a still fuller, richer life for the Berlin of the future</ss>
<ss>Together, let us maintain and develop the ties between the Federal Republic and the <NORP> sectors of Berlin, which is permitted by the <DATE> agreement</ss>
<ss>And I invite Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>: Let us work to bring the <NORP> and <NORP> parts of the city closer together, so that all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with life in one of the great cities of the world</ss>
<ss>To open Berlin still further to all <LOC>, <LOC> and <LOC>, let us expand the vital air access to this city, finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more convenient, more comfortable, and more economical</ss>
<ss>We look to <DATE> when <LOC> Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central <LOC></ss>
<ss>With our <NORP> and <NORP> partners, the United <ORG>s is prepared to help bring international meetings to Berlin</ss>
<ss>It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of <ORG> meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control or other issues that call for international cooperation</ss>
<ss>There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds, and we would be honored to sponsor <DATE> youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs for young <ORG> from the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Our <NORP> and <NORP> friends, I'm certain, will do the same</ss>
<ss>And it's my hope that an authority can be found in <LOC> Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the <NORP> sectors</ss>
<ss>One final proposal, one close to my heart: Sport represents a source of enjoyment and ennoblement, and you many have noted that the Republic of Korea -- South Korea -- has offered to permit certain events of <EVENT> to take place in the <LOC></ss>
<ss>International sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city</ss>
<ss>And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in <DATE> to hold <EVENT> here in Berlin, <LOC> and <LOC>? In <DATE>, as I have said, you <ORG> have built a great city</ss>
<ss>You've done so in spite of threats -- the <NORP> attempts to impose the <LOC>-mark, the blockade</ss>
<ss><DATE> the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall</ss>
<ss>What keeps you here? Certainly there's a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for your defiant courage</ss>
<ss>But I believe there's something deeper, something that involves Berlin's whole look and feel and way of life -- not mere sentiment</ss>
<ss>No one could live long in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions</ss>
<ss>Something instead, that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them, that continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding <NORP> presence that refuses to release human energies or aspirations</ss>
<ss>Something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation, that says yes to this city, yes to the future, yes to freedom</ss>
<ss>In a word, I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love -- love both profound and abiding</ss>
<ss>Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront</ss>
<ss><DATE>, before <LOC> began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the television tower at <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw, treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind</ss>
<ss>Yet even <DATE> when the sun strikes that sphere -- that sphere that towers over all Berlin -- the light makes the sign of the cross</ss>
<ss>There in Berlin, like the city itself, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed</ss>
<ss>As I looked out <TIME> from the <PRODUCT>, that embodiment of <NORP> unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young <PERSON>, "This wall will fall</ss>
<ss>Beliefs become reality</ss>
<ss>" Yes, across <LOC>, this wall will fall</ss>
<ss>For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth</ss>
<ss>The wall cannot withstand freedom</ss>
<ss>And I would like, before I close, to say one word</ss>
<ss>I have read, and I have been questioned since I've been here about certain demonstrations against my coming</ss>
<ss>And I would like to say just one thing, and to those who demonstrate so</ss>
<ss>I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek, no one would ever be able to do what they're doing again</ss>
<ss>Thank you and God bless you all</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>: I've spoken to you from this historic office on many occasions and about many things</ss>
<ss>The power of the <ORG> is often thought to reside within <ORG></ss>
<ss>Yet it doesn't rest here; it rests in you, the <NORP> people, and in your trust</ss>
<ss>Your trust is what gives a President his powers of leadership and his personal strength, and it's what I want to talk to you about this evening</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, I've been silent on the revelations about Iran</ss>
<ss>And you must have been thinking: "Well, why doesn't he tell us what's happening? Why doesn't he just speak to us as he has in the past when we've faced troubles or tragedies?" Others of you, I guess, were thinking: "What's he doing hiding out in <FAC>?" Well, the reason I haven't spoken to you before now is this: You deserve the truth</ss>
<ss>And as frustrating as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion</ss>
<ss>There's been enough of that</ss>
<ss>I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence</ss>
<ss>But I've had to wait, as you have, for the complete story</ss>
<ss>That's why I appointed Ambassador <PERSON> as my Special Counsellor to help get out the thousands of documents to the various investigations</ss>
<ss>And I appointed <ORG>, the <PERSON> board, which took on the chore of pulling the truth together for me and getting to the bottom of things</ss>
<ss>It has now issued its findings</ss>
<ss>I'm often accused of being an optimist, and it's true I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the <ORG>'s report</ss>
<ss>As you know, it's well-stocked with criticisms, which I'll discuss in a moment; but I was very relieved to read this sentence: "</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>the <ORG> is convinced that the President does indeed want the full story to be told</ss>
<ss>" And that will continue to be my pledge to you as the other investigations go forward</ss>
<ss>I want to thank the members of the panel: former Senator <PERSON>, former Secretary of <ORG> <PERSON>, and former national security adviser <PERSON></ss>
<ss>They have done the <ORG>, as well as me personally, a great service by submitting a report of such integrity and depth</ss>
<ss>They have my genuine and enduring gratitude</ss>
<ss>I've studied the <ORG>'s report</ss>
<ss>Its findings are honest, convincing, and highly critical; and I accept them</ss>
<ss>And <TIME> I want to share with you my thoughts on these findings and report to you on the actions I'm taking to implement the <ORG>'s recommendations</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration</ss>
<ss>As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities</ss>
<ss>As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the <NORP> people for this behavior</ss>
<ss>And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds -- well, as the <ORG> would say, this happened on my watch</ss>
<ss>Let's start with the part that is the most controversial</ss>
<ss><DATE> I told the <NORP> people I did not trade arms for hostages</ss>
<ss>My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not</ss>
<ss>As the <PERSON> board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages</ss>
<ss>This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind</ss>
<ss>There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses</ss>
<ss>It was a mistake</ss>
<ss>I undertook the original Iran initiative in order to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government</ss>
<ss>It's clear from the <ORG>'s report, however, that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geopolitical strategy of reaching out to Iran</ss>
<ss>I asked so many questions about the hostages welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan</ss>
<ss>Let me say to the hostage families: We have not given up</ss>
<ss>We never will</ss>
<ss>And I promise you we'll use every legitimate means to free your loved ones from captivity</ss>
<ss>But I must also caution that those <NORP> who freely remain in such dangerous areas must know that they're responsible for their own safety</ss>
<ss>Now, another major aspect of the <ORG>'s findings regards the transfer of funds to the <NORP> <ORG></ss>
<ss>The <PERSON> board wasn't able to find out what happened to this money, so the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the court-appointed <ORG> and the two congressional investigating committees</ss>
<ss>I'm confident the truth will come out about this matter, as well</ss>
<ss>As I told the <PERSON> board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the <ORG></ss>
<ss>But as President, I cannot escape responsibility</ss>
<ss>Much has been said about my management style, a style that's worked successfully for me during <DATE> as Governor of California and for most of my <ORG></ss>
<ss>The way I work is to identify the problem, find the right individuals to do the job, and then let them go to it</ss>
<ss>I've found this invariably brings out the best in people</ss>
<ss>They seem to rise to their full capability, and in the long run you get more done</ss>
<ss>When it came to managing the <ORG> staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record</ss>
<ss>I've already begun correcting this</ss>
<ss>As a start, <DATE> I met with the entire professional staff of <ORG></ss>
<ss>I defined for them the values I want to guide the national security policies of this country</ss>
<ss>I told them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it was in secret</ss>
<ss>I wanted a policy that reflected the will of the <ORG> as well as of <FAC></ss>
<ss>And I told them that there'll be no more freelancing by individuals when it comes to our national security</ss>
<ss>You've heard a lot about the staff of <ORG> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, I can tell you, they are good and dedicated government employees, who put in long hours for the <ORG>'s benefit</ss>
<ss>They are eager and anxious to serve their country</ss>
<ss>One thing still upsetting me, however, is that no one kept proper records of meetings or decisions</ss>
<ss>This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arms shipment before or after the fact</ss>
<ss>I did approve it; I just can't say specifically when</ss>
<ss>Well, rest assured, there's plenty of recordkeeping now going on at 1600 <FAC></ss>
<ss>For <DATE> now, I've been studying the <ORG>'s report</ss>
<ss>I want the <NORP> people to know that this wrenching ordeal of <DATE> has not been in vain</ss>
<ss>I endorse every one of the <PERSON> board's recommendations</ss>
<ss>In fact, I'm going beyond its recommendations so as to put the house in even better order</ss>
<ss>I'm taking action in three basic areas: personnel, national security policy, and the process for making sure that the system works</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, personnel -- I've brought in an accomplished and highly respected new team here at <FAC></ss>
<ss>They bring new blood, new energy, and new credibility and experience</ss>
<ss>Former Senator <PERSON>, my new Chief of Staff, possesses a breadth of legislative and foreign affairs skills that's impossible to match</ss>
<ss>I'm hopeful that his experience as minority and majority leader of the <ORG> can help us forge a new partnership with the <ORG>, especially on foreign and national security policies</ss>
<ss>I'm genuinely honored that he's given up his own Presidential aspirations to serve the country as my Chief of Staff</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, my new national security adviser, is respected for his experience in government and trusted for his judgment and counsel</ss>
<ss>Under him, the <ORG> staff is being rebuilt with proper management discipline</ss>
<ss>Already, almost half the <ORG> professional staff is comprised of new people</ss>
<ss><DATE> I nominated <PERSON>, a man of sterling reputation, to be Director of <ORG></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has served as Director of the <ORG> and as a U</ss>
<ss>S</ss>
<ss>District Court judge</ss>
<ss>He understands the meaning of "rule of law</ss>
<ss>" So that his knowledge of national security matters can be available to me on a continuing basis, I will also appoint <PERSON> to serve as a member of my <ORG></ss>
<ss>I am considering other changes in personnel, and I'll move more furniture, as I see fit, in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Second, in the area of national security policy, I have ordered the <ORG> to begin a comprehensive review of all covert operations</ss>
<ss>I have also directed that any covert activity be in support of clear policy objectives and in compliance with <NORP> values</ss>
<ss>I expect a covert policy that, if <NORP> saw it on the front page of their newspaper, they'd say, "That makes sense</ss>
<ss>" I have had issued a directive prohibiting the <ORG> staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- no ifs, ands, or buts</ss>
<ss>I have asked Vice President <PERSON> to reconvene his task force on terrorism to review our terrorist policy in light of the events that have occurred</ss>
<ss>Third, in terms of the process of reaching national security decisions, I am adopting in total the <PERSON> report's model of how the <ORG> process and staff should work</ss>
<ss>I am directing Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> to take the necessary steps to make that happen</ss>
<ss>He will report back to me on further reforms that might be needed</ss>
<ss>I've created the post of <ORG> legal adviser to assure a greater sensitivity to matters of law</ss>
<ss>I am also determined to make the congressional oversight process work</ss>
<ss>Proper procedures for consultation with the <ORG> will be followed, not only in letter but in spirit</ss>
<ss>Before <DATE>, I will report to the <ORG> on all the steps I've taken in line with the <PERSON> board's conclusions</ss>
<ss>Now, what should happen when you make a mistake is this: You take your knocks, you learn your lessons, and then you move on</ss>
<ss>That's the healthiest way to deal with a problem</ss>
<ss>This in no way diminishes the importance of the other continuing investigations, but the business of our country and our people must proceed</ss>
<ss>I've gotten this message from <NORP> and <NORP> in <ORG>, from allies around the world, and -- if we're reading the signals right -- even from the <NORP></ss>
<ss>And of course, I've heard the message from you, the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>You know, by the time you reach my age, you've made plenty of mistakes</ss>
<ss>And if you've lived your life properly -- so, you learn</ss>
<ss>You put things in perspective</ss>
<ss>You pull your energies together</ss>
<ss>You change</ss>
<ss>You go forward</ss>
<ss>My fellow <NORP>, I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and for you over <DATE></ss>
<ss>And the Lord willing, that's exactly what I intend to do</ss>
<ss>Good night, and God bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>The <PERSON>: Thank you all very much</ss>
<ss>Welcome to <ORG></ss>
<ss>This ceremony and the treaty we're signing <DATE> are both excellent examples of the rewards of patience</ss>
<ss>It was over <DATE>, <DATE>, that I <ORDINAL> proposed what would come to be called the zero option</ss>
<ss>It was a simple proposal -- one might say, disarmingly simple</ss>
<ss>Unlike treaties in the past, it didn't simply codify the status quo or a new arms buildup; it didn't simply talk of controlling an arms race</ss>
<ss>For the <ORDINAL> time in history, the language of "arms control" was replaced by "arms reduction" -- in this case, the complete elimination of an entire class of <PERSON> and <NORP> nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>Of course, this required a dramatic shift in thinking, and it took conventional wisdom some time to catch up</ss>
<ss>Reaction, to say the least, was mixed</ss>
<ss>To some the zero option was impossibly visionary and unrealistic; to others merely a propaganda ploy</ss>
<ss>Well, with patience, determination, and commitment, we've made this impossible vision a reality</ss>
<ss><ORG> Secretary <PERSON>, I'm sure you're familiar with <PERSON> famous tale about the swan, the <NORP>, and the pike</ss>
<ss>It seems that once upon a time these three were trying to move a <ORG>load together</ss>
<ss>They hitched and harnessed themselves to the <ORG></ss>
<ss>It wasn't very heavy, but no matter how hard they worked, the <ORG> just wouldn't move</ss>
<ss>You see, the swan was flying upward; the <NORP> kept crawling backward; the pike kept making for the water</ss>
<ss>The end result was that they got nowhere, and the <ORG> is still there to <DATE></ss>
<ss>Well, strong and fundamental moral differences continue to exist between our nations</ss>
<ss>But <DATE>, on this vital issue, at least, we've seen what can be accomplished when we pull together</ss>
<ss>The numbers alone demonstrate the value of this agreement</ss>
<ss>On the <NORP> side, over 1,500 deployed warheads will be removed, and all ground-launched intermediate-range missiles, including the SS-20's, will be destroyed</ss>
<ss>On our side, our entire complement of <WORK_OF_ART> and ground-launched cruise missiles, with some 400 deployed warheads, will all be destroyed</ss>
<ss>Additional backup missiles on both sides will also be destroyed</ss>
<ss>But the importance of this treaty transcends numbers</ss>
<ss>We have listened to the wisdom in an old <NORP> maxim</ss>
<ss>And I'm sure you're familiar with it, Mr</ss>
<ss><ORG> Secretary, though my pronunciation may give you difficulty</ss>
<ss>The maxim is: <PERSON> no provorey -- trust, but verify</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> Secretary: You repeat that at every meeting</ss>
<ss>The <PERSON>: I like it</ss>
<ss>This agreement contains the most stringent verification regime in history, including provisions for inspection teams actually residing in each other's territory and several other forms of on-site inspection, as well</ss>
<ss>This treaty protects the interests of America's friends and allies</ss>
<ss>It also embodies another important principle: the need for glasnost, a greater openness in military programs and forces</ss>
<ss>We can only hope that this history-making agreement will not be an end in itself but the beginning of a working relationship that will enable us to tackle the other urgent issues before us: strategic offensive nuclear weapons, the balance of conventional forces in <LOC>, the destructive and tragic regional conflicts that beset so many parts of our globe, and respect for the human and natural rights God has granted to all men</ss>
<ss>To all here who have worked so hard to make this vision a reality: Thank you, and congratulations -- above all to <PERSON> and <PERSON></ss>
<ss>To quote another <NORP> proverb -- as you can see, I'm becoming quite an expert -- in <NORP> proverbs: "The harvest comes more from sweat than from the dew</ss>
<ss>" So, I'm going to propose to <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> that we issue one last instruction to you: Get some well-deserved rest</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> Secretary: We're not going to do that</ss>
<ss>The <PERSON>: Well, now, Mr</ss>
<ss><ORG> Secretary, would you like to say a few words before we sign the treaty? The <ORG> Secretary: Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, succeeding generations will hand down their verdict on the importance of the event which we are about to witness</ss>
<ss>But I will venture to say that what we are going to do, the signing of the <ORDINAL>-ever agreement eliminating nuclear weapons, has a universal significance for mankind, both from the standpoint of world politics and from the standpoint of humanism</ss>
<ss>For everyone, and above all, for our two great powers, the treaty whose text is on this table offers a big chance at last to get onto the road leading away from the threat of catastrophe</ss>
<ss>It is our duty to take full advantage of that chance and move together toward a nuclear-free world, which holds out for our children and grandchildren and for their children and grandchildren the promise of a fulfilling and happy life without fear and without a senseless waste of resources on weapons of destruction</ss>
<ss>We can he proud of planting this sapling, which may <DATE> grow into a mighty tree of peace</ss>
<ss>But it is probably still too early to bestow laurels upon each other</ss>
<ss>As the great <NORP> poet and philosopher <PERSON> said: "The reward of a thing well done is to have done it</ss>
<ss>" So, let us reward ourselves by getting down to business</ss>
<ss>We have covered a 7-year-long road, replete with intense work and debate</ss>
<ss>One last step towards this table, and the treaty will be signed</ss>
<ss><DATE>, become a date that will be inscribed in the history books, a date that will mark the watershed separating the era of a mounting risk of nuclear war from the era of a demilitarization of human life</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Good <TIME></ss>
<ss>As I am speaking to you now, <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> is leaving on his return trip to the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>His departure marks the end of three historic days here in Washington in which Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I continued to build a foundation for better relations between our governments and our peoples</ss>
<ss>During <DATE> we took a step -- only a <ORDINAL> step, but still a critical one -- toward building a more durable peace, indeed, a step that may be the most important taken since <EVENT> to slow down the arms buildup</ss>
<ss>I'm referring to the treaty that we signed <DATE> <TIME> in <LOC> of <FAC></ss>
<ss>I believe this treaty represents a landmark in postwar history, because it is not just an arms control but an arms reduction agreement</ss>
<ss>Unlike treaties of the past, this agreement does not simply establish ceilings for new weapons: It actually reduces the number of such weapons</ss>
<ss>In fact, it altogether abolishes an entire class of <PERSON> and <NORP> nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>The verification measures in this treaty are also something new with far-reaching implications</ss>
<ss>On-site inspections and short-notice inspections will be permitted within the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>Again, this is a <ORDINAL>-time event, a breakthrough, and that's why I believe this treaty will not only lessen the threat of war, it can also speed along a process that may someday remove that threat entirely</ss>
<ss>Indeed, this treaty, and all that we've achieved during this summit, signals a broader understanding between the United States and the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>It is an understanding that will help keep the peace as we work toward the ultimate goal of our foreign policy: a world where the people of every land can decide for themselves their form of government and way of life</ss>
<ss>Yet as important as the <ORG> treaty is, there is a further and even more crucial point about <DATE> and the entire summit process: <NORP>-<NORP> relations are no longer focused only on arms control issues</ss>
<ss>They now cover a far broader agenda, one that has, at its root, realism and candor</ss>
<ss>Let me explain this with a saying I've often repeated: Nations do not distrust each other because they're armed; they are armed because they distrust each other</ss>
<ss>And just as real peace means the presence of freedom and justice as well as the absence of war, so, too, summits must be discussions not just about arms but about the fundamental differences that cause nations to be armed</ss>
<ss>Dealing then with the deeper sources of conflict between nations and systems of government is a practical and moral imperative</ss>
<ss>And that's why it was vital to establish a broader summit agenda, one that dealt not only with arms reductions but also people-to-people contacts between our nations and, most important, the issues of human rights and regional conflicts</ss>
<ss>This is the summit agenda we've adopted</ss>
<ss>By doing so, we've dealt not just with arms control issues but also with fundamental problems such as <NORP> expansionism, human rights violations, as well as our own moral opposition to the ideology that justifies such practices</ss>
<ss>In this way, we have put <NORP>-<NORP> relations on a far more candid and far more realistic footing</ss>
<ss>It also means that, while there's movement-indeed, dramatic movement -- in the arms reduction area, much remains to be done in that area as well as in these other critical areas that I've mentioned, especially -- and this goes without saying -- in advancing our goal of a world open to the expansion of human freedom and the growth of <NORP> government</ss>
<ss>So, much work lies ahead</ss>
<ss>Let me explain: On the matter of regional conflicts, I spoke candidly with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> on the issues of Afghanistan, Iran-Iraq, Cambodia, Angola, and Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>I continue to have high hopes -- and he assured me that he did too -- that we can have real cooperation in resolving regional conflicts on terms that promote peace and freedom</ss>
<ss>This is essential to a lasting improvement in our relations</ss>
<ss>So, too, on human rights, there was some very limited movement: resolution of a number of individual eases in which prisoners will be released or exit visas granted</ss>
<ss>There were assurances of future, more substantial movement, which we hope to see become a reality</ss>
<ss>And finally, with regard to the last item on our agenda -- scientific, educational, cultural, and economic exchanges -- we agreed to expand cooperation in ways that will break down some of the artificial barriers between our nations</ss>
<ss>For example, agreement was reached to expand and improve civil air service between our two countries</ss>
<ss>But let me point out here that, while much work is ahead of us, the progress we've made, especially in arms reduction, does reflect a better understanding between ourselves and the <NORP></ss>
<ss>It also reflects something deeper</ss>
<ss>You see, since my <ORDINAL> meeting with <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> in <DATE>, I have always regarded you, the <NORP> people, as full participants in our discussions</ss>
<ss>Though it may surprise Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> to discover that all this time there has been a <ORDINAL> party in the room with us, I do firmly believe the principal credit for the patience and persistence that brought success <DATE> belongs to you, the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>Your support over <DATE> has laid the basis for these negotiations</ss>
<ss>Your support made it possible for us to rebuild our military strength, to liberate <LOC>, to strike hard against terrorism in Libya, and more recently to protect our strategic interests and bolster our friends in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Your support made possible our policy of helping freedom fighters like those in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola, Cambodia, and other places around the globe</ss>
<ss>And when <DATE> at Reykjavik I refused <NORP> demands that we trade away SDI, our Strategic Defense Initiative that could erect a space shield against ballistic missiles, your overwhelming support made it clear to the <NORP> leaders that the <NORP> people prefer no deal to a bad deal and will back their President on matters of national security</ss>
<ss>In short, your support for our foreign policy goals -- building a safer peace as we advance the cause of world freedom -- has helped bring the <NORP> to the bargaining table</ss>
<ss>It makes it possible now to hope for a real, fundamental improvement in our relations</ss>
<ss>You know, the question has often been asked whether <NORP> leaders who are accountable to their people aren't at a grave disadvantage in negotiating with leaders of <NORP> States who bear no such burden</ss>
<ss>Well, believe me, I think I can answer that question</ss>
<ss>I can speak from personal experience</ss>
<ss>Over the long run, no leader at the bargaining table can enjoy any greater advantage than the knowledge that he has behind him a people who are strong and free and alert and resolved to remain that way -- people like you</ss>
<ss>And it's this kind of informed and enlightened support, this hidden strength of <NORP> government, that enabled us to do what we did <DATE> at the Washington summit</ss>
<ss>Now that the treaty's been signed, it will be submitted to the <ORG> for the next step: the ratification process</ss>
<ss>I will meet with the leadership of <ORG> here <DATE> <TIME>, and I'm confident that the <ORG> will now act in an expeditious way to fulfill its duty under our Constitution</ss>
<ss>To this end, let me explain the background</ss>
<ss>In the mid- and <DATE>'s the <NORP> began to deploy hundreds of new, mobile intermediate-range missiles capable of destroying major cities and military installations in <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>This action was an unprovoked, new dimension of the threat against our friends and allies on both continents, a new threat to which the <NORP> nations had no comparable counter</ss>
<ss>Despite intense pressure from the <NORP>, <ORG> proceeded with what we called a two-track policy</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, we would deploy a limited number of our own <ORG> missiles as a deterrent, but at the same time push hard in negotiations to do away with this entirely new nuclear threat</ss>
<ss>And we set out to do this with a formula I <ORDINAL> put forward in <DATE></ss>
<ss>It was called the zero-option</ss>
<ss>It meant the complete elimination of these missiles on both sides</ss>
<ss>Well, at <ORDINAL>, many called this a mere propaganda ploy, some even here in this country</ss>
<ss>But we were persistent, our allies steadfast, and eventually the <NORP> returned to the bargaining table</ss>
<ss>The result is our <ORG> treaty</ss>
<ss>As you see from the map on the screen now, the <NORP> missiles, which will be removed and eliminated under the treaty, have been a major threat to the security of our friends and allies on two continents, <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>Under the terms of this treaty, we will be eliminating 400 deployed warheads, while the <NORP> Union eliminates 1,600, or four times as many</ss>
<ss>Now, let me also point out that this does not, however, leave <ORG> unprotected</ss>
<ss>In fact, we will maintain a substantial deterrent force on the ground, in the air, and at sea</ss>
<ss>Our commitment to <ORG>'s strategy of being able to respond as necessary to any form of aggression remains steadfast</ss>
<ss>And with regard to verification, as I've mentioned, we have the breakthroughs of on-site inspections and short-notice inspections not only at potential missile deployment sites but at the facility where the <NORP> SS-20 missiles and their components have been assembled</ss>
<ss>We have a verification procedure that assures each side that the missiles of the other side have been destroyed and that new ones aren't built</ss>
<ss>Here, then, is a treaty that shows how persistence and consistency eventually can pay off in arms negotiations</ss>
<ss>And let me assure you, too, that this treaty has been accomplished with unprecedented consultation with our allies and friends</ss>
<ss>I have spoken personally with the leaders of the major democracies, as has Secretary <PERSON> and our diplomats</ss>
<ss>This treaty has full allied support</ss>
<ss>But if persistence is paying off in our arms reduction efforts, the question of human rights and regional conflicts are still problems in our relations</ss>
<ss>But I am pleased that some progress has been made in these areas, also</ss>
<ss>Now, in addition to these candid exchanges on our four-part agenda, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I did do some important planning for a Moscow summit <DATE></ss>
<ss>We agreed that we must redouble our efforts to reach agreements on reducing the levels of <PERSON> and <NORP> long-range, or strategic, nuclear arms, as I have proposed in the <ORG> negotiations</ss>
<ss>He and I made real progress toward our goal <ORDINAL> agreed to at Geneva: to achieve deep, 50-percent cuts in our arsenals of those powerful weapons</ss>
<ss>We agreed that we should build on our efforts to achieve agreement on a <ORG> treaty at the earliest possible date, and we've instructed our delegations in Geneva accordingly</ss>
<ss>Now, I believe deep reductions in these offensive weapons, along with the development of SDI, would do much to make the world safer</ss>
<ss>For that reason, I made it clear that our SDI program will continue and that when we have a defense ready to deploy we will do so</ss>
<ss>About the future, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I also agreed that as nuclear weapons are reduced it becomes all the more important to redress the disparities in conventional and chemical weapons, where the <NORP> now enjoy significant advantages over the United States and our allies</ss>
<ss>I think then from all of this you can see not only the direction of <NORP>-<NORP> relations but the larger framework of <NORP> foreign policy</ss>
<ss>As I told <ORG> in <DATE>, we seek to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era: the threat of nuclear war and the threat of <NORP>ism</ss>
<ss>And that's why, by pursuing SDI, which is a defense against offensive missiles, and by going for arms reduction rather than just arms control, we're moving away from the so-called policy of mutual assured destruction, by which nations hold each other hostage to nuclear terror and destruction</ss>
<ss>So, too, we are saying that the postwar policy of containment is no longer enough, that the goal of <NORP> foreign policy is both world peace and world freedom, that as a people we hope and will work for <DATE> when all of God's children will enjoy the human dignity that their creator intended</ss>
<ss>I believe we gained some ground with regard to that cause in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Since <DATE> in office, I have argued that the future belongs not to repressive or <NORP> ways of life but to the cause of freedom -- freedom of the marketplace, freedom to speak, assemble, and vote</ss>
<ss>And when we see the progress of democracy in <DATE>, from <LOC> to <LOC>, we must be optimistic about the future of our children</ss>
<ss>When we were together in Iceland, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> told me that this sort of talk is sometimes viewed in the <NORP> Union as a threat, but I told him then and I have said since then that this is no threat at all but only a dream: the <NORP> dream</ss>
<ss>And it's a dream that has meant so much to so many, a dream that still shines out to the world</ss>
<ss>You know, <DATE>, <PERSON> and I were deeply moved by a story told by former <ORG> reporter and <NORP> immigrant <PERSON></ss>
<ss>It's the story of <ORG>, his mother, a woman caught in one of the terrible struggles of the postwar era, the <NORP> civil war at the end of <EVENT>, a mother who was tried and executed because she smuggled her children out to safety in America</ss>
<ss>It is also the story of how her son secretly vowed to return to Greece someday to take vengeance on the man who had sent his mother to her death</ss>
<ss>But at the end of the story, <PERSON> finds he cannot extract the vengeance he promised himself</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> writes it would have relieved the pain that had filled him for <DATE>, but it would also have broken the one bridge still connecting him to his mother, that part of him most like her</ss>
<ss>As he tells it: "</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>and her final cry was not a curse on her killers, but an invocation of what she'd died for -- a declaration of love</ss>
<ss>" These simple last words of Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s mother, of <ORG>, were: "My children</ss>
<ss>" How that cry echoes down through <DATE>, a cry for all children of the world, a cry for peace, for a world of love and understanding</ss>
<ss>And it is the hope of heeding such words -- the call for freedom and peace spoken by a chosen people in a promised land, the call spoken by the <ORG> carpenter -- <ORG>ene carpenter, I should say, standing at <LOC>, the carpenter whose birth into the poverty of a stable we celebrate -- it is these words that we remember as <DATE> approaches and we reflect on the events of <DATE> here in Washington</ss>
<ss>So, let us remember the children and the future we want for them</ss>
<ss>And let us never forget that this promise of peace and freedom, the gift that is ours as <NORP>, the gift that we seek to share with all the world, depends for its strength on the spiritual source from which it comes</ss>
<ss>So, during <DATE>, let us also reflect that in the prayers of simple people there is more power and might than that possessed by all the great statesmen or armies of the <LOC></ss>
<ss>Let us then thank God for all His blessings to this nation, and ask Him for His help and guidance so that we might continue the work of peace and foster the hope of a world where human freedom is enshrined</ss>
<ss>To sum up then: This summit was a clear success</ss>
<ss>We made progress on each item in our four-part agenda</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I have agreed to meet in <DATE> in Moscow to continue what we've achieved during <DATE></ss>
<ss>I believe there is reason for both hope and optimism</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, and distinguished Members of the <ORG> and <ORG>: When we <ORDINAL> met here <DATE>-many of us for the <ORDINAL> time -- it was with the hope of beginning something new for America</ss>
<ss>We meet here <TIME> in this historic <ORG> to continue that work</ss>
<ss>If anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, I say let's leave that to history; we're not finished yet</ss>
<ss>So, my message to you <TIME> is put on your work shoes; we're still on the job</ss>
<ss>History records the power of the ideas that brought us here <DATE>-ideas like the individual's right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit; the free market as an engine of economic progress</ss>
<ss>And as an ancient <NORP> philosopher, <PERSON>, said: "Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo it</ss>
<ss>" Well, these ideas were part of a larger notion, a vision, if you will, of America herself -- an America not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an America, too, of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods; an America whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values: the value of work, of family, of religion, and of the love of freedom that God places in each of us and whose defense He has entrusted in a special way to this nation</ss>
<ss>All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was here-the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words: "We the People," the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around</ss>
<ss>And there's one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which I would offer to you now</ss>
<ss>Just as those who created this Republic pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too, America's leaders <DATE> must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party but what is best for America</ss>
<ss>In the spirit of <PERSON>, let us affirm that in this <ORG> <TIME> there are no <NORP>, no <NORP> -- just <NORP></ss>
<ss>Yes, we will have our differences, but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us</ss>
<ss>Those who sent us here to serve them -- the millions of <NORP> watching and listening <TIME>-expect this of us</ss>
<ss>Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We've done this before</ss>
<ss>And as we have worked together to bring down spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; America has created more jobs and better, higher paying jobs; family income has risen for <DATE>, and America's poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an economic and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives, growth, and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77-percent increase in charitable giving; a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the <NORP> dream</ss>
<ss>In international relations, too, there's only one description for what, together, we have achieved: a complete turnabout, a revolution</ss>
<ss><DATE>, America was weak, and freedom everywhere was under siege</ss>
<ss><DATE> America is strong, and democracy is everywhere on the move</ss>
<ss>From <LOC> to <LOC>, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold</ss>
<ss>We've replaced "<WORK_OF_ART>" with "Look up to America</ss>
<ss>" We've rebuilt our defenses</ss>
<ss>And of all our accomplishments, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our country's uniform</ss>
<ss>And in a few moments, I'm going to talk about three developments -- arms reduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic revolution -- that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine <DATE>, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era</ss>
<ss>I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both <NORP>ism and nuclear terror</ss>
<ss><TIME>, then, we're strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free</ss>
<ss>This is the state of our <ORG></ss>
<ss>And if we will work together <DATE>, I believe we can give a future <PERSON> and a future <ORG> the chance to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom not just the state of our <ORG> but the state of our world</ss>
<ss>Toward this end, we have four basic objectives <TIME></ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, steps we can take <DATE> to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, let's check our progress in attacking social problems, where important gains have been made, but which still need critical attention</ss>
<ss>I mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values</ss>
<ss>Our <ORDINAL> objective <TIME> is global: continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL> and finally, our nation has remained at peace for <DATE>, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom</ss>
<ss>We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next <PERSON> inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give that <PERSON>: a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded</ss>
<ss>This is a full agenda</ss>
<ss>It's meant to be</ss>
<ss>You see, my thinking on <DATE> is quite simple: Let's make this the best of 8</ss>
<ss>And that means it's all out -- right to the finish line</ss>
<ss>I don't buy the idea that this is <DATE> of anything, because we're not talking here <TIME> about registering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our successes</ss>
<ss>And that's why our focus is the values, the principles, and ideas that made America great</ss>
<ss>Let's be clear on this point</ss>
<ss>We're for limited government, because we understand, as <ORG> did, that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every <NORP> of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of <NORP> prosperity and freedom</ss>
<ss>One other thing we <NORP> like -- the future -- like the sound of it, the idea of it, the hope of it</ss>
<ss>Where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond</ss>
<ss>Where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down</ss>
<ss>Where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes</ss>
<ss>Yes, we <NORP> like the future and like making the most of it</ss>
<ss>Let's do that now</ss>
<ss>And let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of <ORG> deficits</ss>
<ss>We have had a balanced budget only eight times in <DATE></ss>
<ss>For the <ORDINAL> time in <DATE>, <ORG> spent less in real terms <DATE> than <DATE></ss>
<ss>We took <MONEY> off <DATE> deficit compared to <DATE></ss>
<ss>The deficit itself has moved from <PERCENT> of the gross national product to <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>And perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits</ss>
<ss>You know, a few of us can remember when, not too <DATE>, those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt, because we owe it to ourselves</ss>
<ss>Well, at last there is agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich</ss>
<ss>Our recent budget agreement, designed to reduce <ORG> deficits by <MONEY> over <DATE>, builds on this consensus</ss>
<ss>But this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past: more broken promises and more unchecked spending</ss>
<ss>As I indicated in my <ORDINAL> State of the <ORG>, what ails us can be simply put: <ORG> is too big, and it spends too much money</ss>
<ss>I can assure you, the bipartisan leadership of <ORG>, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement</ss>
<ss>And this includes the swift and certain use of the veto power</ss>
<ss>Now, it's also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling <ORG> deficits</ss>
<ss>The simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenues -- something <NORP> families do and <ORG> can't -- has caused crisis after crisis in this city</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I will say to you <TIME> what I have said before and will continue to say: The budget process has broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul</ss>
<ss>With each ensuing year, the spectacle before the <NORP> people is the same as it was <DATE>: budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions that pack <MONEY> worth of spending into one bill, and <ORG> on the brink of default</ss>
<ss>I know I'm echoing what you here in the <ORG> have said, because you suffered so directly</ss>
<ss>But let's recall that in <DATE>, of 91 appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only 10 made it on time</ss>
<ss><DATE>, of the 13 appropriations bills due by <DATE>, none of them made it</ss>
<ss>Instead, we had four continuing resolutions lasting <DATE>, then <DATE>, and <DATE>, and <DATE>, respectively</ss>
<ss>And then, along came these behemoths</ss>
<ss>This is the conference report -- 1,053 pages, report weighing <QUANTITY></ss>
<ss>Then this -- a reconciliation bill <DATE> late that was 1,186 pages long, weighing <QUANTITY></ss>
<ss>And the long-term continuing resolution -- this one was <DATE>, and it's 1,057 pages long, weighing <QUANTITY></ss>
<ss>That was a total of <QUANTITY> of paper and ink</ss>
<ss>You had <TIME> -- yes, <TIME> -- to consider each, and it took 300 people at my <ORG> just to read the bill so the <ORG> wouldn't shut down</ss>
<ss><ORG> shouldn't send another one of these</ss>
<ss>No, and if you do, I will not sign it</ss>
<ss>Let's change all this</ss>
<ss>Instead of a <PERSON>ial budget that gets discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues? And let's remember our deadline is <DATE>, not <DATE></ss>
<ss>Let's get the people's work done in time to avoid a footrace with <PERSON></ss>
<ss>And, yes, <DATE> -- to coin a phrase -- a new beginning: 13 individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by <ORG></ss>
<ss>I'm also certain you join me in saying: Let's help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the <PERSON> a tool that, though I will not get to use it, is one I know future <PERSON>s of either party must have</ss>
<ss>Give the <PERSON> the same authority that 43 <ORG> use in their States: the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and enforce budget discipline</ss>
<ss>Let's approve the line-item veto</ss>
<ss>And let's take a partial step in this direction</ss>
<ss>Most of you in this <ORG> didn't know what was in this catchall bill and report</ss>
<ss>Over <DATE>, we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there</ss>
<ss>For example, there's millions for items such as cranberry research, <ORG>, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of wildflowers</ss>
<ss>And that's not to mention the five or so million  that -- so that people from developing nations could come here to watch <ORG> at work</ss>
<ss>I won't even touch that</ss>
<ss>So, <TIME> I offer you this challenge</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> I will send back to you those items as rescissions, which if I had the authority to line them out I would do so</ss>
<ss>Now, review this <MONEY> package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, if adopted, it will improve our deficit reduction goals</ss>
<ss>And what an example we can set, that we're serious about getting our financial accounts in order</ss>
<ss>By acting and approving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control</ss>
<ss>There is another vital reform</ss>
<ss>Yes, <LAW> has been profoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent</ss>
<ss>Let us do now what so many States do to hold down spending and what 32 State legislatures have asked us to do</ss>
<ss>Let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of <NORP> and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces <ORG> to live within its means</ss>
<ss>Reform of the budget process -- including the line-item veto and balanced budget amendment -- will, together with real restraint on government spending, prevent the <ORG> budget from ever again ravaging the family budget</ss>
<ss>Let's ensure that <ORG> never again legislates against the family and the home</ss>
<ss><DATE> I signed an <ORG> order on the family requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family</ss>
<ss>But let us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process not just in this administration but in all future administrations</ss>
<ss>It's time for <ORG> to consider, at the beginning, a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of <NORP> society, the family</ss>
<ss>And speaking of the family, let's turn to a matter on the mind of every <NORP> parent <TIME>: education</ss>
<ss>We all know the sorry story of the sixties and seventies-soaring spending, plummeting test scores-and that hopeful trend of the eighties, when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up</ss>
<ss>There's a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times: In a child's education, money can never take the place of basics like discipline, hard work, and, yes, homework</ss>
<ss>As a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education -- more than we spend on defense</ss>
<ss>Yet across our country, <ORG> like New Jersey's <PERSON> are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important as how much we spend</ss>
<ss>Opening up the teaching profession to all qualified candidates, merit pay -- so that good teachers get A's as well as apples -- and stronger curriculum, as Secretary <PERSON> has proposed for high schools -- these imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular new kid in America's schools</ss>
<ss>How can we help? Well, we can talk about and push for these reforms</ss>
<ss>But the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the States, local communities and, most of all, to the parents and teachers</ss>
<ss>My friends, <DATE>, <ORG> declared war on poverty, and poverty won</ss>
<ss><DATE> <ORG> has 59 major welfare programs and spends <MONEY> a year on them</ss>
<ss>What has all this money done? Well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape</ss>
<ss><ORG> welfare programs have created a massive social problem</ss>
<ss>With the best of intentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty: the family</ss>
<ss>Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one generation to the next, of too many fragmented families</ss>
<ss>It is time -- this may be the most radical thing I've said in <DATE> in this office -- it's time for Washington to show a little humility</ss>
<ss>There are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 States and a thousand communities around the Nation</ss>
<ss>It is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights</ss>
<ss>States have begun to show us the way</ss>
<ss>They've demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work</ss>
<ss>Let us give the States more flexibility and encourage more reforms</ss>
<ss>Let's start making our welfare system the <ORDINAL> rung on America's ladder of opportunity, a boost up from dependency, not a graveyard but a birthplace of hope</ss>
<ss>And now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life</ss>
<ss>The <ORDINAL> is an untold <NORP> success story</ss>
<ss>Recently, we released our <DATE> survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs</ss>
<ss>Cocaine use is declining, and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began</ss>
<ss>We can be proud that our students are just saying no to drugs</ss>
<ss>But let us remember what this menace requires: commitment from every part of America and every single <NORP>, a commitment to a drugfree America</ss>
<ss>The war against drugs is a war of individual battles, a crusade with many heroes, including America's young people and also someone very special to me</ss>
<ss>She has helped so many of our young people to say no to drugs</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, much credit belongs to you, and I want to express to you your husband's pride and your country's thanks</ss>
<ss>'</ss>
<ss>Surprised you, didn't I?  Well, now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront</ss>
<ss><TIME>, I call America -- a good nation, a moral people -- to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand</ss>
<ss>To those who say this violates a woman's right to control of her own body: Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all <ORG> funding for abortion and with a human life amendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother</ss>
<ss>Our <NORP> tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense</ss>
<ss>But with that one exception, let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt</ss>
<ss>I pledge to you <TIME> I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of <NORP> so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them</ss>
<ss>And let me add here: So many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation's health and vigor</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> opens its proceedings <DATE>, as does <ORG>, with an acknowledgment of <ORG></ss>
<ss>Yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment <DATE> for those who wish to pray</ss>
<ss>I believe <ORG> should pass our school prayer amendment</ss>
<ss>Now, to make sure there is a full nine member <ORG> to interpret the law, to protect the rights of all <NORP>, I urge the <ORG> to move quickly and decisively in confirming Judge <PERSON> to the highest Court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the <ORG> judiciary</ss>
<ss>Here then are our domestic priorities</ss>
<ss>Yet if the <ORG> and the administration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy, to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms, and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutions</ss>
<ss>Our policies consistently received the strongest support of the late <ORG>man <PERSON> of Virginia</ss>
<ss>I'm sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing</ss>
<ss>One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth</ss>
<ss>A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs</ss>
<ss>We should always remember: Protectionism is destructionism</ss>
<ss>America's jobs, America's growth, America's future depend on trade -- trade that is free, open, and fair</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we have it within our power to take a major step toward a growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this <LOC></ss>
<ss>I'm speaking of the historic free trade agreement negotiated between our country and Canada</ss>
<ss>And I can also tell you that we're determined to expand this concept, south as well as north</ss>
<ss><DATE> I will be traveling to Mexico, where trade matters will be of foremost concern</ss>
<ss>And over <DATE>, our <ORG> and <ORG> can make the start of such a <NORP> accord a reality</ss>
<ss>Our goal must be <DATE> when the free flow of trade, from the tip of <ORG> to <LOC>, unites the people of <LOC> in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange, when all borders become what the <PERSON>-Canadian border so long has been: a meeting place rather than a dividing line</ss>
<ss>This movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and against <NORP> rule</ss>
<ss>This global democratic revolution has removed the specter, so frightening <DATE>, of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> and <LOC>, only a <ORDINAL> of the people enjoyed democratic rule in <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE> over <PERCENT> of <NORP> live in nations committed to democratic principles</ss>
<ss>And the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny</ss>
<ss>In Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning, because that nation is so near our own borders</ss>
<ss>The recent revelations of a former high-level <NORP> major, <PERSON>, show us that, even as they talk peace, the <NORP> government of Nicaragua has established plans for a large 600,000-man army</ss>
<ss>Yet even as these plans are made, the <NORP> regime knows the tide is turning, and the cause of <NORP> freedom is riding at its crest</ss>
<ss>Because of the freedom fighters, who are resisting <NORP> rule, the <NORP> have been forced to extend some democratic rights, negotiate with church authorities, and release a few political prisoners</ss>
<ss>The focus is on the <NORP>, their promises and their actions</ss>
<ss>There is a consensus among the four <NORP> democratic <PERSON>s that the <NORP> have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> again have promised reforms</ss>
<ss>Their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy</ss>
<ss>On <DATE> my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted, which reflects our mutual desire for peace, freedom, and democracy in Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>I ask <ORG> to pass this request</ss>
<ss>Let us be for the people of Nicaragua what <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> were for our forefathers and the cause of <NORP> independence</ss>
<ss>So, too, in <NORP>istan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace</ss>
<ss>We support the <PERSON></ss>
<ss>There can be no settlement unless all <NORP> troops are removed and the <NORP> people are allowed genuine self-determination</ss>
<ss>I have made my views on this matter known to Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>But not just Nicaragua or <NORP>istan -- yes, everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide across the world: freedom fighters rising up in Cambodia and Angola, fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred</ss>
<ss>Their cause is our cause: freedom</ss>
<ss>Yet even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war</ss>
<ss>But let's have no illusions</ss>
<ss><DATE> of steady decline in the value of our <DATE> defense investment have increased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizing earlier hard-won goals</ss>
<ss>We must face squarely the implications of this negative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal both <DATE> and in the future</ss>
<ss>This same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as well</ss>
<ss>But the resolve of America and its <ORG> allies has opened the way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction</ss>
<ss>Our recently signed <ORG> treaty is historic, because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most stringent verification regime in arms control history, including several forms of short-notice, on-site inspection</ss>
<ss>I submitted the treaty <DATE>, and I urge the <ORG> to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss>In addition to the <ORG> treaty, we're within reach of an even more significant <ORG> agreement that will reduce <PERSON> and <NORP> long-range missile -- or strategic arsenals by half</ss>
<ss>But let me be clear</ss>
<ss>Our approach is not to seek agreement for agreement's sake but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies</ss>
<ss>We will never put our security at risk -- or that of our allies-just to reach an agreement with the <NORP></ss>
<ss>No agreement is better than a bad agreement</ss>
<ss>As I mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what we never had -- a future free of nuclear terror</ss>
<ss>Reduction of strategic offensive arms is one step, SDI another</ss>
<ss>Our funding request for our Strategic Defense Initiative is <PERCENT> of the total defense budget</ss>
<ss>SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent</ss>
<ss>SDI has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction</ss>
<ss>It reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind</ss>
<ss>Strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, more stable basis for deterrence</ss>
<ss>We must also remember that SDI is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident, a Chernobyl of the sky, or an accidental launch or some madman who might come along</ss>
<ss>We've seen such changes in the world in <DATE></ss>
<ss>As <NORP>ism struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent</ss>
<ss>As the global democratic revolution has put <NORP>ism on the defensive, we have left behind <DATE> of retreat</ss>
<ss>America is again a vigorous leader of the free world, a nation that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests</ss>
<ss>No legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of <NORP> power from ever occurring again</ss>
<ss>But my thoughts <TIME> go beyond this, and I hope you'll let me end <TIME> with a personal reflection</ss>
<ss>You know, the world could never be quite the same again after <PERSON>, a trustworthy and dependable clerk of <ORG>, took his pen and engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of our <LAW></ss>
<ss>And in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was forever altered when, on a ridge overlooking <LOC> in an obscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg, <ORG> spoke of our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the <LOC></ss>
<ss>At <DATE>, I suggested that we live in equally momentous times, that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a quiet, pleasant, greening land called America</ss>
<ss>Not everything has been made perfect in <DATE>, nor will it be made perfect in seven times <DATE>, but before us, <DATE> and beyond, are great prospects for the cause of peace and world freedom</ss>
<ss>It means, too, that the young <NORP> I spoke of <DATE>, as well as those who might be coming along the Virginia or Maryland shores <TIME> and seeing for the <ORDINAL> time the lights of this Capital City -- the lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to the memory of our great men -- it means those young <NORP> will find a city of hope in a land that is free</ss>
<ss>We can be proud that for them and for us, as those lights along the <LOC> are still seen <TIME> signaling as they have for <DATE> and as we pray God they always will, that another generation of <NORP> has protected and passed on lovingly this place called America, this shining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people</ss>
<ss>Thank you, and God bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Thank you, <PERSON>, and I want to thank all of you very much for a very warm welcome</ss>
<ss>It's a great pleasure to be here at <ORG>, and I want to thank you all for turning out</ss>
<ss>I know you must be very busy <DATE>, studying and taking your final examinations</ss>
<ss>So, let me just say <PERSON></ss>
<ss><PERSON> couldn't make it <DATE> because she's visiting Leningrad, which she tells me is a very beautiful city, but she, too, says hello and wishes you all good luck</ss>
<ss>Let me say it's also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>Before I left Washington, I received many heartfelt letters and telegrams asking me to carry here a simple message, perhaps, but also some of the most important business of this summit: It is a message of peace and good will and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoples</ss>
<ss>As you know, I've come to Moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates</ss>
<ss>In this, our <ORDINAL> summit, <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> and I have spent <TIME> together, and I feel that we're getting to know each other well</ss>
<ss>Our discussions, of course, have been focused primarily on many of the important issues of <DATE>, issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments</ss>
<ss>But <ORDINAL> I want to take a little time to talk to you much as I would to any group of university students in the United States</ss>
<ss>I want to talk not just of the realities of <DATE> but of the possibilities of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Standing here before a mural of your revolution, I want to talk about a very different revolution that is taking place right now, quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict</ss>
<ss>Its effects are peaceful, but they will fundamentally alter our world, shatter old assumptions, and reshape our lives</ss>
<ss>It's easy to underestimate because it's not accompanied by banners or fanfare</ss>
<ss>It's been called the technological or information revolution, and as its emblem, one might take the tiny silicon chip, no bigger than a fingerprint</ss>
<ss>One of these chips has more computing power than a roomful of old-style computers</ss>
<ss>As part of an exchange program, we now have an exhibition touring your country that shows how information technology is transforming our lives -- replacing manual labor with robots, forecasting weather for farmers, or mapping the genetic code of DNA for medical researchers</ss>
<ss>These microcomputers <DATE> aid the design of everything from houses to ears to spacecraft; they even design better and faster computers</ss>
<ss>They can translate <LANGUAGE> into <LANGUAGE> or enable the blind to read or help <PERSON> produce on one synthesizer the sounds of a whole orchestra</ss>
<ss>Linked by a network of satellites and fiber-optic cables, one individual with a desktop computer and a telephone commands resources unavailable to the largest governments <DATE></ss>
<ss>Like a chrysalis, we're emerging from the economy of <EVENT> -- an economy confined to and limited by the <LOC>'s physical resources -- into, as one economist titled his book, "<WORK_OF_ART>," in which there are no bounds on human imagination and the freedom to create is the most precious natural resource</ss>
<ss>Think of that little computer chip</ss>
<ss>Its value isn't in the sand from which it is made but in the microscopic architecture designed into it by ingenious human minds</ss>
<ss>Or take the example of the satellite relaying this broadcast around the world, which replaces thousands of <QUANTITY> of copper mined from the <LOC> and molded into wire</ss>
<ss>In the new economy, human invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete</ss>
<ss>We're breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny</ss>
<ss>Even as we explore the most advanced reaches of science, we're returning to the age-old wisdom of our culture, a wisdom contained in the book of <WORK_OF_ART> beginning was the spirit, and it was from this spirit that the material abundance of creation issued forth</ss>
<ss>But progress is not foreordained</ss>
<ss>The key is freedom -- freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication</ss>
<ss>The renowned scientist, scholar, and founding father of this university, <PERSON>, knew that</ss>
<ss>"It is common knowledge," he said, "that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid, particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy</ss>
<ss>" You know, one of the <ORDINAL> contacts between your country and mine took place between <LANGUAGE> and <NORP> explorers</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> were members of <PERSON>'s last voyage on an expedition searching for an <LOC> passage; on the island of Unalaska, they came upon the <NORP>, who took them in, and together with the native inhabitants, held a prayer service on the ice</ss>
<ss>The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with vision, with the courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown</ss>
<ss>These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States</ss>
<ss>They are the prime movers of the technological revolution</ss>
<ss>In fact, one of the largest personal computer firms in the United States was started by two college students, no older than you, in the garage behind their home</ss>
<ss>Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste</ss>
<ss>What of all the entrepreneurs that fail? Well, many do, particularly the successful ones; often several times</ss>
<ss>And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the way; yes, it's what they learned from failing</ss>
<ss>Like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth, experience is the greatest teacher</ss>
<ss>And that's why it's so hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true</ss>
<ss>The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world</ss>
<ss>There's an old story about a town -- it could be anywhere -- with a bureaucrat who is known to be a good-for-nothing, but he somehow had always hung on to power</ss>
<ss>So <DATE>, in a town meeting, an old woman got up and said to him: "There is a folk legend here where I come from that when a baby is born, an angel comes down from heaven and kisses it on one part of its body</ss>
<ss>If the angel kisses him on his hand, he becomes a handyman</ss>
<ss>If he kisses him on his forehead, he becomes bright and clever</ss>
<ss>And I've been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing</ss>
<ss>"  We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the world</ss>
<ss>Places such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan have vaulted into the technological era, barely pausing in the industrial age along the way</ss>
<ss>Low-tax agricultural policies in the subcontinent mean that in <DATE> India is now a net exporter of food</ss>
<ss>Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are blowing over the People's Republic of China, where one-quarter of the world's population is now getting its <ORDINAL> taste of economic freedom</ss>
<ss>At the same time, the growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> in <DATE>, only a third of the population lived under <NORP> government; <DATE> over <PERCENT> does</ss>
<ss>In the Philippines, in the Republic of Korea, free, contested, <NORP> elections are the order of <DATE></ss>
<ss>Throughout the world, free markets are the model for growth</ss>
<ss>Democracy is the standard by which governments are measured</ss>
<ss>We <NORP> make no secret of our belief in freedom</ss>
<ss>In fact, it's something of a national pastime</ss>
<ss>Every four years the <NORP> people choose a new <PERSON>, and <DATE> is one of <DATE></ss>
<ss>At one point there were 13 major candidates running in the two major parties, not to mention all the others, including the <NORP> and <NORP> candidates -- all trying to get my job</ss>
<ss>About 1,000 local television stations, 8,500 radio stations, and 1,700 <DATE> newspapers -- each one an independent, private enterprise, fiercely independent of the Government -- report on the candidates, grill them in interviews, and bring them together for debates</ss>
<ss>In the end, the people vote; they decide who will be the next <PERSON></ss>
<ss>But freedom doesn't begin or end with elections</ss>
<ss>Go to any <NORP> town, to take just an example, and you'll see dozens of churches, representing many different beliefs -- in many places, synagogues and mosques -- and you'll see families of every conceivable nationality worshiping together</ss>
<ss>Go into any schoolroom, and there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence, that they are endowed by their <PERSON> with certain unalienable rights -- among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- that no government can justly deny; the guarantees in their <EVENT> for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion</ss>
<ss>Go into any courtroom, and there will preside an independent judge, beholden to no government power</ss>
<ss>There every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers, usually 12 men and women -- common citizens; they are the ones, the only ones, who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence</ss>
<ss>In that court, the accused is innocent until proven guilty, and the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused</ss>
<ss>Go to any university campus, and there you'll find an open, sometimes heated discussion of the problems in <NORP> society and what can be done to correct them</ss>
<ss>Turn on the television, and you'll see the legislature conducting the business of government right there before the camera, debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land</ss>
<ss><DATE> in any demonstration, and there are many of them; the people's right of assembly is guaranteed in the <EVENT> and protected by the police</ss>
<ss>Go into any union hall, where the members know their right to strike is protected by law</ss>
<ss>As a matter of fact, one of the many jobs I had before this one was being president of a union, <ORG></ss>
<ss>I led my union out on strike, and I'm proud to say we won</ss>
<ss>But freedom is more even than this</ss>
<ss>Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things</ss>
<ss>It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace</ss>
<ss>It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions</ss>
<ss>It is the right to put forth an idea, scoffed at by the experts, and watch it catch fire among the people</ss>
<ss>It is the right to dream -- to follow your dream or stick to your conscience, even if you're the only one in a sea of doubters</ss>
<ss>Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth, but that every individual life is infinitely precious, that every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offer</ss>
<ss>America is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities</ss>
<ss>Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling; they're ties of kinship</ss>
<ss>In America, you'll find <NORP>, <NORP>, <NORP>, peoples from <LOC> and <LOC></ss>
<ss>They come from every part of this vast continent, from every continent, to live in harmony, seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected, each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the richness it brings to our lives</ss>
<ss>Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the <LOC></ss>
<ss>We can only hope that it won't be long before all are allowed to do so and <NORP>, <NORP>, <NORP> can freely visit their homelands, just as this <NORP>-<NORP> visits his</ss>
<ss>Freedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and materialistic, but <NORP> are one of the most religious peoples on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Because they know that liberty, just as life itself, is not earned but a gift from God, they seek to share that gift with the world</ss>
<ss>"Reason and experience," said <PERSON> in his farewell address, "both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle</ss>
<ss>And it is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government</ss>
<ss>" Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited, unintrusive; a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government <ORDINAL>ary to the important things in life, the true sources of value found only in family and faith</ss>
<ss>But I hope you know I go on about these things not simply to extol the virtues of my own country but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land</ss>
<ss>Who, after all, needs to tell the land of <PERSON> about the quest for truth, the home of Kandinsky and Scriabin about imagination, the rich and noble culture of the Uzbek man of letters Alisher Navoi about beauty and heart? The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity</ss>
<ss>Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom</ss>
<ss>It comes, not from the literature of America, but from this country, from one of the greatest writers of <DATE>, <PERSON>, in the novel "Dr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>" He writes: "I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threats -- any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retribution after death -- then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed himself</ss>
<ss>But this is just the point -- what has for <DATE> raised man above the beast is not the cudgel, but an inward music -- the irresistible power of unarmed truth</ss>
<ss>" The irresistible power of unarmed truth</ss>
<ss><DATE> the world looks expectantly to signs of change, steps toward greater freedom in the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>We watch and we hope as we see positive changes taking place</ss>
<ss>There are some, I know, in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future -- sometimes it takes faith</ss>
<ss>It's like that scene in the cowboy movie <PERSON> and the <PERSON> Kid, which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see</ss>
<ss>The posse is closing in on the two outlaws, <PERSON> and <PERSON>, who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff, with a sheer drop of <QUANTITY> to the raging rapids below</ss>
<ss><PERSON> turns to <PERSON> and says their only hope is to jump into the river below, but <PERSON> refuses</ss>
<ss>He says he'd rather fight it out with the posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered</ss>
<ss><PERSON> says that's suicide and urges him to jump, but <PERSON> still refuses and finally admits, "I can't swim</ss>
<ss>" <PERSON> breaks up laughing and says, "You crazy fool, the fall will probably kill you</ss>
<ss>" And, by the way, both <PERSON> and <PERSON> made it, in case you didn't see the movie</ss>
<ss>I think what I've just been talking about is perestroika and what its goals are</ss>
<ss>But change would not mean rejection of the past</ss>
<ss>Like a tree growing strong through <DATE>, rooted in the <LOC> and drawing life from the sun, so, too, positive change must be rooted in traditional values -- in the land, in culture, in family and community -- and it must take its life from the eternal things, from the source of all life, which is faith</ss>
<ss>Such change will lead to new understandings, new opportunities, to a broader future in which the tradition is not supplanted but finds its full flowering</ss>
<ss>That is the future beckoning to your generation</ss>
<ss>At the same time, we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized will always be insecure</ss>
<ss>Such freedom will always be looking over its shoulder</ss>
<ss>A bird on a tether, no matter how long the rope, can always be pulled back</ss>
<ss>And that is why, in my conversation with <ORG> Secretary <PERSON>, I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change -- to put guarantees on reform</ss>
<ss>And we've been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world: <FAC></ss>
<ss>It's time to remove the barriers that keep people apart</ss>
<ss>I'm proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries</ss>
<ss><ORG> Secretary <PERSON> mentioned on <DATE> a wonderful phrase you have in <LANGUAGE> for this: "Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times</ss>
<ss>" Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I <ORDINAL> began working on this in <DATE></ss>
<ss>In our discussion <DATE>, we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future</ss>
<ss>But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans</ss>
<ss>Words travel lighter, and that's why we'd like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals and our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in <TIME></ss>
<ss>Nothing would please us more than for the <NORP> people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life</ss>
<ss><DATE>, few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> treaty, which <ORG> Secretary <PERSON> and I signed <DATE> in Washington and whose instruments of ratification we will exchange <DATE> -- the <ORDINAL> true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history, calling for the elimination of an entire class of <NORP> and <NORP> nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>And <DATE>, we saw the beginning of your withdrawal from Afghanistan, which gives us hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin and that that suffering country may find self-determination, unity, and peace at long last</ss>
<ss>It's my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction and conflicts in many regions of the globe and that the serious discussions that led to the Geneva accords on Afghanistan will help lead to solutions in southern <LOC>, Ethiopia, Cambodia, <LOC>, and <LOC></ss>
<ss>I have often said: Nations do not distrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they distrust each other</ss>
<ss>If this globe is to live in peace and prosper, if it is to embrace all the possibilities of the technological revolution, then nations must renounce, once and for all, the right to an expansionist foreign policy</ss>
<ss>Peace between nations must be an enduring goal, not a tactical stage in a continuing conflict</ss>
<ss>I've been told that there's a popular song in your country -- perhaps you know it -- whose evocative refrain asks the question, "Do the <NORP> want a war?" In answer it says: "Go ask that silence lingering in the air, above the birch and poplar there; beneath those trees the soldiers lie</ss>
<ss>Go ask my mother, ask my wife; then you will have to ask no more, 'Do the <NORP> want a war?'" But what of your one-time allies? What of those who embraced you on the <PERSON>? What if we were to ask the watery graves of the <LOC> or the <NORP> battlefields where America's fallen were buried far from home? What if we were to ask their mothers, sisters, and sons, do <NORP> want war? Ask us, too, and you'll find the same answer, the same longing in every heart</ss>
<ss>People do not make wars; governments do</ss>
<ss>And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain, for economic advantage, for ideology</ss>
<ss>A people free to choose will always choose peace</ss>
<ss><NORP> seek always to make friends of old antagonists</ss>
<ss>After a colonial revolution with Britain, we have cemented for all ages the ties of kinship between our nations</ss>
<ss>After a terrible <EVENT> between <LOC>, we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation</ss>
<ss>We fought two world wars in my lifetime against <NORP>y and one with Japan, but now the Federal Republic of <NORP>y and Japan are two of our closest allies and friends</ss>
<ss>Some people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of strain, but they're the frictions of all families, and the family of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one</ss>
<ss>I can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see <NORP> and <NORP> diplomats grappling with the problem of trade disputes between America and a growing, exuberant, exporting <NORP> Union that had opened up to economic freedom and growth</ss>
<ss>And as important as these official people-to-people exchanges are, nothing would please me more than for them to become unnecessary, to see travel between <LOC> and <LOC> become so routine that university students in the <NORP> Union could take <DATE> off in <DATE> and, just like students in the <LOC> do now, put packs on their backs and travel from country to country in <LOC> with barely a passport cheek in between</ss>
<ss>Nothing would please me more than to see <DATE> that a concert promoter in, say, England could call up a <NORP> rock group, without going through any government agency, and have them playing in Liverpool <TIME></ss>
<ss>Is this just a dream? Perhaps, but it is a dream that is our responsibility to have come true</ss>
<ss>Your generation is living in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in <NORP> history</ss>
<ss>It is a time when the <ORDINAL> breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope, when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free</ss>
<ss>I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of <PERSON>'s "<WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>" Comparing his nation to a speeding troika, <PERSON> asks what will be its destination</ss>
<ss>But he writes, "There was no answer save the bell pouring forth marvelous sound</ss>
<ss>" We do not know what the conclusion will be of this journey, but we're hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled</ss>
<ss>In this Moscow spring, this <DATE>, we may be allowed that hope: that freedom, like the fresh green sapling planted over <PERSON>'s grave, will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture</ss>
<ss>We may be allowed to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through, ringing through, leading to a new world of reconciliation, friendship, and peace</ss>
<ss>Thank you all very much, and da blagoslovit vas gospod -- God bless you</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>: Dear friends, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has kindly agreed to answer your questions</ss>
<ss>But since he doesn't have too much time, <TIME> -- so, those who have questions, please ask them</ss>
<ss>Strategic Arms Reductions  Q: And this is a student from the history faculty, and he says that he's happy to welcome you on behalf of the students of the university</ss>
<ss>And the <ORDINAL> question is that the improvement in the relations between the two countries has come about during your tenure as <PERSON>, and in this regard he would like to ask the following question</ss>
<ss>It is very important to get a handle on the question of arms control and, specifically, the limitation of strategic arms</ss>
<ss>Do you think that it will be possible for you and the <ORG> Secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arms during the time that you are still <PERSON>? <PERSON> <PERSON>: Well, the arms treaty that is being negotiated now is the so-called <LAW> treaty, and it is based on taking the intercontinental ballistic missiles and reducing them by half, down to parity between our two countries</ss>
<ss>Now, this is a much more complicated treaty than the <ORG> treaty, the intermediate-range treaty, which we have signed and which our two governments have ratified and is now in effect</ss>
<ss>So, there are many things still to be settled</ss>
<ss>You and we have had negotiators in Geneva for <DATE> working on various points of this treaty</ss>
<ss>Once we had hoped that maybe, like the <ORG> treaty, we would have been able to sign it here at this summit meeting</ss>
<ss>It is not completed; there are still some points that are being debated</ss>
<ss>We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office, which is in <DATE>, but I assure you that if it isn't -- I assure you that I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed</ss>
<ss>My dream has always been that once we've started down this road, we can look forward to <DATE> -- you can look forward to <DATE> -- when there will be no more nuclear weapons in the world at all</ss>
<ss>Young People Q: The question is: The universities influence public opinion, and the student wonders how the youths have changed since <DATE> when you were a student up until now? <PERSON> <PERSON>: Well, wait <TIME></ss>
<ss>How you have changed since the era of my own youth? Q: How just students have changed, the youth have changed</ss>
<ss>You were a student</ss>
<ss>At your time there were one type</ss>
<ss>How they have changed? <PERSON> <PERSON>: Well, I know there was a period in our country when there was a very great change for the worse</ss>
<ss>When I was Governor of California, I could start a riot just by going to a campus</ss>
<ss>But that has all changed, and I could be looking out at an <NORP> student body as well as I'm looking out here and would not be able to tell the difference between you</ss>
<ss>I think that back in <DATE> -- I did happen to go to school, get my college education in a unique time; it was the time of <EVENT>, when, in a country like our own, there was 25-percent unemployment and the bottom seemed to have fallen out of everything</ss>
<ss>But we had -- I think what maybe I should be telling you from my point here, because I graduated in <DATE>, that I should tell you that when you get to be my age, you're going to be surprised how much you recall the feelings you had in <DATE> here and that -- how easy it is to understand the young people because of your own having been young once</ss>
<ss>You know an awful lot more about being young than you do about being old</ss>
<ss>And I think there is a seriousness, I think there is a sense of responsibility that young people have, and I think that there is an awareness on the part of most of you about what you want your adulthood to be and what the country you live in -- you want it to be</ss>
<ss>And I have a great deal of faith</ss>
<ss>I said <DATE> to 76 students -- they were half <NORP> and half <LANGUAGE></ss>
<ss>They had held a conference here and in Finland and then in the United States, and I faced them just <DATE>, and I had to say -- I couldn't tell the difference looking at them, which were which, but I said one line to them</ss>
<ss>I said I believe that if all the young people of the world <DATE> could get to know each other, there would never be another war</ss>
<ss>And I think that of you</ss>
<ss>I think that of the other students that I've addressed in other places</ss>
<ss>And of course, I know also that you're young and, therefore, there are certain things that at times take precedence</ss>
<ss>I'll illustrate one myself</ss>
<ss><DATE> after I graduated, my alma mater brought me back to the school and gave me an honorary degree</ss>
<ss>And I had to tell them they compounded a sense of guilt I had nursed for <DATE> because I always felt the <ORDINAL> degree they gave me was honorary</ss>
<ss>You're great! Carry on</ss>
<ss>Regional Conflicts Q: Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, you have just mentioned that you welcome the efforts -- settlement of the Afghanistan question and the difference of other regional conflicts</ss>
<ss>What conflicts do you mean? <LOC> conflicts, <NORP>, or <NORP>? <PERSON> <PERSON>: Well, for example, in South <LOC>, where Namibia has been promised its independence as a nation -- another new <NORP> nation</ss>
<ss>But it is impossible because of a civil war going on in another country there, and that civil war is being fought on one side by some 30,000 to 40,000 <NORP> troops who have gone from the <LOC> over there and are fighting on one side with one kind of authoritative government</ss>
<ss>When that country was freed from being a colony and given its independence, one faction seized power and made itself the government of that nation</ss>
<ss>And leaders of another -- seeming the majority of the people had wanted, simply, the people to have the right to choose the government that they wanted, and that is the civil war that is going on</ss>
<ss>But what we believe is that those foreign soldiers should get out and let them settle it, let the citizens of that nation settle their problems</ss>
<ss>And the same is true in Nicaragua</ss>
<ss>Nicaragua has been -- Nicaragua made a promise</ss>
<ss>They had a dictator</ss>
<ss>There was a revolution, there was an organization that -- and was aided by others in the revolution, and they appealed to <ORG> for help in getting the dictator to step down and stop the killing</ss>
<ss>And he did</ss>
<ss>But <ORG> had asked, what are the goals of the revolution? And they were given in writing, and they were the goals of pluralistic society, of the right of unions and freedom of speech and press and so forth and free elections -- a pluralistic society</ss>
<ss>And then the one group that was the best organized among the revolutionaries seized power, exiled many of the other leaders, and has its own government, which violated every one of the promises that had been made</ss>
<ss>And here again, we want -- we're trying to encourage the getting back those -- or making those promises come true and letting the people of that particular country decide their fate</ss>
<ss><NORP> MIAs in Afghanistan Q: Esteemed Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I'm very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of 310 <NORP> soldiers being missing in Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>Are you willing to help in their search and their return to the motherland? <PERSON> <PERSON>: Very much so</ss>
<ss>We would like nothing better than that</ss>
<ss><NORP> <EVENT> Q: The reservation of the inalienable rights of citizens guaranteed by the <EVENT> faces certain problems; for example, the right of people to have arms, or for example, the problem appears, an evil appears whether spread of pornography or narcotics is compatible with these rights</ss>
<ss>Do you believe that these problems are just unavoidable problems connected with democracy, or they could be avoided? <PERSON> <PERSON>: Well, if I understand you correctly, this is a question about the inalienable rights of the people -- does that include the right to do criminal acts -- for example, in the use of drugs and so forth? No</ss>
<ss>No, we have a set of laws</ss>
<ss>I think what is significant and different about our system is that every country has a constitution, and most constitutions or practically all of the constitutions in the world are documents in which the government tells the people what the people can do</ss>
<ss>Our <EVENT> is different, and the difference is in three words; it almost escapes everyone</ss>
<ss>The three words are, "We the people</ss>
<ss>" Our <EVENT> is a document in which we the people tell the government what its powers are</ss>
<ss>And it can have no powers other than those listed in that document</ss>
<ss>But very carefully, at the same time, the people give the government the power with regard to those things which they think would be destructive to society, to the family, to the individual and so forth -- infringements on their rights</ss>
<ss>And thus, the government can enforce the laws</ss>
<ss>But that has all been dictated by the people</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s Retirement Plans Q: Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, from history I know that people who have been connected with great power, with big posts, say goodbye, leave these posts with great difficulty</ss>
<ss>Since your term of office is coming to an end, what sentiments do you experience and whether you feel like, if, hypothetically, you can just stay for another term?  <PERSON> <PERSON>: Well, I'll tell you something</ss>
<ss>I think it was a kind of revenge against <PERSON>, who was elected four times -- the only <PERSON></ss>
<ss>There had kind of grown a tradition in our country about two terms</ss>
<ss>That tradition was started by Washington, our <ORDINAL> <PERSON>, only because there was great talk at the formation of our country that we might become a monarchy, and we had just freed ourselves from a monarchy</ss>
<ss>So, when the <ORDINAL> term was over, <PERSON> stepped down and said he would do it -- stepping down -- so that there would not get to be the kind of idea of an inherited aristocracy</ss>
<ss>Well, succeeding <PERSON>s -- many of them didn't get a chance at a <ORDINAL> term; they did one term and were gone</ss>
<ss>But that tradition kind of remained, but it was just a tradition</ss>
<ss>And then <PERSON> ran the four times -- died very early in his <ORDINAL> term</ss>
<ss>And suddenly, in the atmosphere at that time, they added an amendment to the <EVENT> that <PERSON>s could only serve two terms</ss>
<ss>When I get out of office -- I can't do this while I'm in office, because it will look as I'm selfishly doing it for myself -- when I get out of office, I'm going to travel around what I call the mashed-potato circuit -- that is the after-dinner speaking and the speaking to luncheon groups and so forth -- I'm going to travel around and try to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out that amendment to the <EVENT> because it was an interference with the <NORP> rights of the people</ss>
<ss>The people should be allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for, for as many times as they want to vote for him; and that it is they who are being denied a right</ss>
<ss>But you see, I will no longer be <PERSON> then, so I can do that and talk for that</ss>
<ss>There are a few other things I'm going to try to convince the people to impress upon our <ORG>, the things that should be done</ss>
<ss>I've always described it that if -- in Hollywood, when I was there, if you didn't sing or dance, you wound up as an afterdinner speaker</ss>
<ss>And I didn't sing or dance</ss>
<ss>So, I have a hunch that I will be out on the speaking circuit, telling about a few things that I didn't get done in government, but urging the people to tell the <ORG> they wanted them done</ss>
<ss><NORP> Q: Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, I've heard that a group of <NORP> have come here because they couldn't meet you in the United States of America</ss>
<ss>If you fail to meet them here, will you be able to correct it and to meet them back in the United States? <PERSON> <PERSON>: I didn't know that they had asked to see me</ss>
<ss>If they've come here or whether to see them there?  I'd be very happy to see them</ss>
<ss>Let me tell you just a little something about the <NORP> <NORP> in our land</ss>
<ss>We have provided <QUANTITY> of land for what are called preservations -- or reservations, I should say</ss>
<ss>They, from the beginning, announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life, as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains and so forth</ss>
<ss>And we set up these reservations so they could, and have a <ORG> to help take care of them</ss>
<ss>At the same time, we provide education for them -- schools on the reservations</ss>
<ss>And they're free also to leave the reservations and be <NORP> citizens among the rest of us, and many do</ss>
<ss>Some still prefer, however, that way -- that early way of life</ss>
<ss>And we've done everything we can to meet their demands as to how they want to live</ss>
<ss>Maybe we made a mistake</ss>
<ss>Maybe we should not have humored them in that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle</ss>
<ss>Maybe we should have said, no, come join us; be citizens along with the rest of us</ss>
<ss>As I say, many have; many have been very successful</ss>
<ss>And I'm very pleased to meet with them, talk with them at any time and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be</ss>
<ss>And you'd be surprised: Some of them became very wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil, and you can get very rich pumping oil</ss>
<ss>And so, I don't know what their complaint might be</ss>
<ss><NORP> Dissidents    Well, that's one I don't know about, or maybe the information hasn't been all given out on that</ss>
<ss>But you have to understand that <NORP> come from every corner of the world</ss>
<ss>I received a letter from a man that called something to my attention recently</ss>
<ss>He said, you can go to live in France, but you cannot become a <ORG>; you can go to live in <NORP>y, you cannot become a <NORP> -- or a <PERSON>, or a <NORP>, or whatever</ss>
<ss>But he said anyone, from any corner of the world, can come to live in America and become an <NORP></ss>
<ss>You have to realize that we are a people that are made up of every strain, nationality, and race of the world</ss>
<ss>And the result is that when people in our country think someone is being mistreated or treated unjustly in another country, these are people who still feel that kinship to that country because that is their heritage</ss>
<ss>In America, whenever you meet someone new and become friends, one of the <ORDINAL> things you tell each other is what your bloodline is</ss>
<ss>For example, when I'm asked, I have to say <NORP>, <LANGUAGE>, and <ORG> -- <LANGUAGE> and <ORG> on my mother's side, <NORP> on my father's side</ss>
<ss>But all of them have that</ss>
<ss>Well, when you take on to yourself a wife, you do not stop loving your mother</ss>
<ss>So, <NORP> all feel a kind of a kinship to that country that their parents or their grandparents or even some great-grandparents came from; you don't lose that contact</ss>
<ss>So, what I have come and what I have brought to the <ORG> Secretary -- and I must say he has been very cooperative about it -- I have brought lists of names that have been brought to me from people that are relatives or friends that know that -- or that believe that this individual is being mistreated here in this country, and they want him to be allowed to emigrate to our country -- some are separated families</ss>
<ss>One that I met in this, <DATE>, was born the same time I was</ss>
<ss>He was born of <LANGUAGE> parents who had moved to America, oh, way back in <DATE>, and he was born in <DATE></ss>
<ss>And then sometime later, the family moved back to Russia</ss>
<ss>Now he's grown, has a son</ss>
<ss>He's an <NORP> citizen</ss>
<ss>But they wanted to go back to America and being denied on the grounds that, well, they can go back to America, but his son married a <LANGUAGE> young lady, and they want to keep her from going back</ss>
<ss>Well, the whole family said, no, we're not going to leave her alone here</ss>
<ss>She's a member of the family now</ss>
<ss>Well, that kind of a case is brought to me personally, so I bring it to the <ORG> Secretary</ss>
<ss>And as I say, I must say, he has been most helpful and most agreeable about correcting these things</ss>
<ss>Now, I'm not blaming you; I'm blaming bureaucracy</ss>
<ss>We have the same type of thing happen in our own country</ss>
<ss>And every once in a while, somebody has to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it loose and say, Stop doing what you're doing! And this is the type of thing and the names that we have brought</ss>
<ss>And it is a list of names, all of which have been brought to me personally by either relatives or close friends and associates</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss>You're all very kind</ss>
<ss>I thank you very much</ss>
<ss>And I hope I answered the questions correctly</ss>
<ss>Nobody asked me what it was going to feel like to not be <PERSON> anymore</ss>
<ss>I have some understanding, because after I'd been Governor for <DATE> and then stepped down, I want to tell you what it's like</ss>
<ss>We'd only been home <DATE>, and someone invited us out to dinner</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I both went out, got in the back seat of the car, and waited for somebody to get in front and drive us</ss>
<ss>That is beautiful</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Madam Chairman, delegates to the convention, and fellow citizens: Thank you for that warm and generous welcome</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I have been enjoying the finest of <NORP> hospitality since we arrived here <DATE></ss>
<ss>And believe me, after that reception I don't think <ORG> has ever been bigger than it has <TIME></ss>
<ss>And with all due respect to <PERSON> cuisine cooking and New Orleans jazz, nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this hall, except maybe a victory celebration on <DATE></ss>
<ss>In that spirit, I think we can be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for having made "<NORP>" a proud word once again and America a proud nation again</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I are so honored to be your guests <TIME>, to share a little of your special time, and we thank you</ss>
<ss>Now I want to invoke executive privilege to talk for a moment about a very special lady who has been selfless not just for our party but for the entire Nation</ss>
<ss>She is a strong, courageous, compassionate woman; and wherever she's gone, here in the United <ORG>s as well as abroad, whether with young or old, whether comforting the grieving or supporting the youngsters who are fighting the scourge of drugs, she makes us proud</ss>
<ss>I've been proud of her for a long time, but never more so than in <DATE></ss>
<ss>With your tribute to <PERSON> <DATE>, you warmed my heart as well as hers, and believe me, she deserves your tribute</ss>
<ss>And I am deeply grateful to you for what you have done</ss>
<ss>When people tell me that I became President on <DATE>, I feel I have to correct them</ss>
<ss>You don't become President of the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>You are given temporary custody of an institution called the Presidency, which belongs to our people</ss>
<ss>Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure</ss>
<ss>That trust began with many of you in this room many conventions ago</ss>
<ss>Many's the time that I've said a prayer of thanks to all <NORP> who placed this trust in my hands</ss>
<ss>And <TIME>, please accept again our heartfelt gratitude, <PERSON>'s and mine, for this special time that you've given in our lives</ss>
<ss><TIME>, you multiplied the honor with a moving tribute, and being only human, there's a part of me that would like to take credit for what we've achieved</ss>
<ss>But <TIME>, before we do anything else, let us remember that tribute really belongs to the <MONEY>45 million citizens who make up the greatest -- and the <ORDINAL> -- three words in our <LAW>: "We the People</ss>
<ss>" It is the <NORP> people who endured the great challenge of lifting us from the depths of national calamity, renewing our mighty economic strength, and leading the way to restoring our respect in the world</ss>
<ss>They are an extraordinary breed we call <NORP></ss>
<ss>So, if there's any salute deserved <TIME>, it's to the heroes everywhere in this land who make up the doers, the dreamers, and the lifebuilders without which our glorious experiment in democracy would have failed</ss>
<ss>This convention brings back so many memories to a fellow like me</ss>
<ss>I can still remember my <ORDINAL> <NORP> convention: <PERSON> giving a speech that-  -- sent tingles down my spine</ss>
<ss>No, I have to confess, I wasn't actually there</ss>
<ss>The truth is, way back then, I belonged to the other party</ss>
<ss>But surely we can remember another convention</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time for our beloved country</ss>
<ss>And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams</ss>
<ss>When I look back, I wonder if we dared be ' so bold to take on those burdens</ss>
<ss>But in that same city of Detroit, when <DATE> was only in <DATE>, another great <NORP>, <PERSON>, told <NORP> not to hold back from dangers ahead but to rejoice: "Our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our children it shall be given to make this Republic the mightiest among the peoples of mankind</ss>
<ss>" <PERSON> said those, <DATE></ss>
<ss>In <DATE> we needed every bit of that kind of faith</ss>
<ss>That year, it was our dream that together we could rescue America and make a new beginning, to create anew that shining city on a hill</ss>
<ss>The dream we shared was to reclaim our government, to transform it from one that was consuming our prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who created prosperity</ss>
<ss>It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny</ss>
<ss>We made a determination that our dream would not be built on a foundation of sand -- something called "<WORK_OF_ART>" -- but we would trust, instead, the <NORP> spirit</ss>
<ss>And, yes, we were unashamed in believing that this dream was driven by a community of shared values of family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom</ss>
<ss>And on <TIME>, we left with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make America great again</ss>
<ss>We had faith because the heroes in our midst had never failed us before</ss>
<ss><PERSON> knew what these <NORP> with character of steel could do when he wrote: "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph</ss>
<ss>" And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete, the road has been glorious indeed</ss>
<ss><DATE>, we met at a time when America was in economic chaos, and <DATE> we meet in a time of economic promise</ss>
<ss>We met then in international distress and <DATE> with global hope</ss>
<ss>Now, I think we can be forgiven if we engage in a little review of that history <TIME> -- as the saying goes, just a friendly reminder</ss>
<ss>I've been doing a little remembering of my own because of all that inflated rhetoric by our friends in Atlanta <DATE></ss>
<ss>But then, inflation is their specialty</ss>
<ss>Before we came to Washington, <NORP> had just suffered the two worst back-to-back <DATE> of inflation in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Those are the facts, and as <PERSON> said, "Facts are stubborn things</ss>
<ss>" Interest rates had jumped to <PERCENT>, the highest in <DATE>, more than doubling the average <DATE> mortgage payments for working families -- our families</ss>
<ss>When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan <DATE> vacations, it was to plan economic survival</ss>
<ss>Facts are stubborn things</ss>
<ss>Industrial production was down, and productivity was down for <DATE></ss>
<ss>The average <DATE> -- you missed me</ss>
<ss>The average <DATE> wage plunged <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>The median family income fell <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Facts are stubborn things</ss>
<ss>Our friends on the other side had actually passed the single highest tax bill in the <MONEY>00-year history of the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>Auto loans, because of their policies, went <PERCENT>, so our great factories began shutting down</ss>
<ss>Fuel costs jumped through the atmosphere, more than doubling</ss>
<ss>Then people waited in gas lines as well as unemployment lines</ss>
<ss>Facts are stupid things-stubborn things, I should say</ss>
<ss>And then there was the misery index</ss>
<ss>That was <DATE> gimmick they designed for the <DATE> campaign</ss>
<ss>They added the unemployment and inflation rates</ss>
<ss>And it came to <PERCENT> in <DATE>, and they declared that our candidate, <PERSON>, had no right to seek re-election with that kind of misery index</ss>
<ss>But <DATE>, in the <DATE> campaign, they didn't mention the misery index</ss>
<ss>Do you suppose it was because it was <PERCENT>? In <DATE> it had become <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>And <DATE>, in Atlanta at their convention, there was again no mention of the misery index</ss>
<ss>Why? Because right now it's <PERCENT></ss>
<ss>Facts are stubborn things</ss>
<ss>When we met in Detroit in <DATE>, it was a <DATE> of discontent for America around the world</ss>
<ss>Our national defense had been so weakened, the <NORP> Union had begun to engage in reckless aggression, including the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> response to that was to forbid our athletes to participate in the <DATE> <EVENT> and to try to pull the rug out from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE>, on any given day, we had military aircraft that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts and ships that couldn't leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew</ss>
<ss>Our Embassy in Pakistan was burned to the ground, and the one in Iran was stormed and occupied with all <NORP> taken as hostages</ss>
<ss>The world began to question the constancy and resolve of the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>Our leaders answered not that there was something wrong with our government but that our people were at fault because of some malaise</ss>
<ss>Well, facts are stubborn things</ss>
<ss>When our friends <DATE> talked of unemployment, despair, hopelessness, economic weakness, I wondered why on <LOC> they were talking about <DATE> instead of <DATE></ss>
<ss>And now we hear talk that it's time for a change</ss>
<ss>Well, ladies and gentlemen, another friendly reminder: We are the change</ss>
<ss>We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We focused on hope, not despair</ss>
<ss>We challenged the failed policies of the past because we believed that a society is great not because of promises made by its government but only because of progress made by its people</ss>
<ss>And that was our change</ss>
<ss>We said something shocking: Taxes ought to be reduced, not raised</ss>
<ss>We cut the tax rates for the working folks of America</ss>
<ss>We indexed taxes, and that stopped a bracket creep which kicked average wage earners into higher tax brackets when they had only received a cost-of-living pay raise</ss>
<ss>And we initiated reform of the unfairness in our tax system</ss>
<ss>And what do you know, the top <PERCENT> of earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue at the lower rates than they ever had before, and millions of earners at the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any income tax at all</ss>
<ss>That was our change</ss>
<ss>So, together we pulled out of a tailspin and created <MONEY>7<MONEY>/<MONEY> million good jobs</ss>
<ss>That's more than a quarter of a million new jobs a month -- every month -- for <DATE></ss>
<ss>America is working again</ss>
<ss>And just since our <DATE> convention, we have created over <MONEY><MONEY> million of those new jobs</ss>
<ss>Now, just why would our friends on the other side want to change that? Why do they think putting you out of work is better than putting you to work? New homes are being built</ss>
<ss>New car sales reached record levels</ss>
<ss>Exports are starting to climb again</ss>
<ss>Factory capacity is approaching maximum use</ss>
<ss>You know, I've noticed they don't call it <NORP> anymore</ss>
<ss>As for inflation, well, that too has changed</ss>
<ss>We changed it from the time it hit <PERCENT> in <DATE> down to between 3</ss>
<ss>5 and 4 percent</ss>
<ss>Interest rates are less than half of what they were</ss>
<ss>In fact, nearly half of all mortgages taken out on family homes in <DATE> and more than a third of those in <DATE> were actually old loans being refinanced at the new lower rates</ss>
<ss>Young families have finally been able to get some relief</ss>
<ss>These, too, were our changes</ss>
<ss>We rebuilt our <ORG></ss>
<ss>We liberated <FAC> from the <NORP> and helped return that island to democracy</ss>
<ss>We struck a firm blow against <NORP> terrorism</ss>
<ss>We've seen the growth of democracy in <PERCENT> of <LOC></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> have begun to pull out of Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>The bloody <EVENT> is coming to an end</ss>
<ss>And for the <ORDINAL> time in <DATE> we have the prospects of peace in Southwest Africa and the removal of <NORP> and other foreign forces from the region</ss>
<ss>And in <DATE> of our administration, not i inch of ground has fallen to the <NORP></ss>
<ss>The President</ss>
<ss><DATE> we have the <ORDINAL> treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of <NORP> and <NORP> nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>We're working on the Strategic Defense Initiative to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror</ss>
<ss>And <NORP> and <NORP> relations are the best they've ever been since <EVENT></ss>
<ss>And virtually all this change occurred-and continues to occur -- in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's time for a change</ss>
<ss>They resisted our defense buildup</ss>
<ss>They resisted our tax cuts</ss>
<ss>They resisted cutting the fat out of government</ss>
<ss>And they resisted our appointments of judges committed to the law and the <LAW></ss>
<ss>And it's time for some more straight talk</ss>
<ss>This time it's about the budget deficit</ss>
<ss>Yes, it's much too high</ss>
<ss>But the President doesn't vote for a budget, and the President can't spend a dime</ss>
<ss>Only the <ORG> can do that</ss>
<ss>They blame the defense increases for the deficit, yet defense spending <DATE>, in real dollars, is almost exactly what it was <DATE></ss>
<ss>In a 6-year period, <ORG> cut defense spending authority by <MONEY></ss>
<ss>And for every $<MONEY> reduction in defense outlays, they added $<MONEY> to domestic spending</ss>
<ss>Now, if they had passed my <ORDINAL> budget, my <ORDINAL> spending plan in <DATE>, the cumulative outlays and deficits would have been <MONEY> lower by <DATE></ss>
<ss><DATE> I've been in office, I have supported and called for a balanced budget amendment to the <LAW>, and the liberals have said <DATE></ss>
<ss>I called for the line-item veto, which 43 Governors have, to cut fat in the budget, and the liberals have said no</ss>
<ss>Every year I've attempted to limit their wild spending sprees, and they've said no</ss>
<ss>They would have us believe that runaway budget deficits began in <DATE> when we took office</ss>
<ss>Well, let me tell you something: The fact is, when they began their war on poverty in <DATE>, from <DATE> through <DATE> -- 'm just those <DATE>, the budgets increased to five times what they had been, and the deficits went up to 5<MONEY> times what they had been before their war on poverty</ss>
<ss>Now, don't we know that if they're elected their answer will be the one they've relied on in the past, and that is higher taxes</ss>
<ss>The other party has controlled <ORG> for 5<MONEY> out of <DATE></ss>
<ss>They've controlled the <ORG> also for <DATE></ss>
<ss>Where we really need a change is to elect <NORP> majorities in both Houses</ss>
<ss>And then <PERSON> can have a team that will protect your tax cuts; keep America strong; hold down inflation and interest rates; appoint judges to preserve your rights; and, yes, reduce the budget deficit</ss>
<ss>Early in the <ORDINAL> term, we set out to reduce Federal regulations that had been imposed on the people, on businesses, and on local and <ORG> governments</ss>
<ss><DATE> I'm proud to say that we have eliminated so many unnecessary regulations that government-required paperwork imposed on citizens, businesses, and other levels of government has been reduced by <MONEY> <TIME> of paperwork a year</ss>
<ss>And <PERSON> was there</ss>
<ss>No, you haven't heard it all yet</ss>
<ss><PERSON> headed up that task force that eliminated those regulations</ss>
<ss>In <DATE> and before, it took <DATE> to get a <ORG> card</ss>
<ss>Now it takes <DATE></ss>
<ss>It only takes <DATE> to get a passport</ss>
<ss>It used to take <DATE></ss>
<ss>It took <DATE> to get an export license</ss>
<ss>Now it's <DATE>, and for some countries, only 5</ss>
<ss>It took <DATE> to process a claim for <ORG> I loan -- <DATE></ss>
<ss>It now takes less than one-fourth of that -- <DATE></ss>
<ss>I think these specifics suggest there is a new level of competent management in the Departments of our government</ss>
<ss><PERSON> played a major role in everything that we have accomplished in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Now early on, we had a foreign policy problem</ss>
<ss>Our <ORG> allies were under the threat of <NORP> intermediate-range missiles, and <ORG> had no equivalent deterrent</ss>
<ss>Our effort to provide a deterrent -- Pershing and ground-launched cruise missiles on the <ORG> line -- resulted in political problems for our <ORG> allies</ss>
<ss>There was objection on the part of many other people to deployment of our missiles</ss>
<ss><PERSON> represented us in Brussels with the heads of the <ORG> countries; and they agreed, when he finished, to take the missiles</ss>
<ss>This subsequently persuaded the <NORP> to sign the <ORG> treaty and begin removing their SS-<MONEY>0's</ss>
<ss>None of our achievements happened by accident, but only because we overcame liberal opposition to put our programs in place</ss>
<ss>And without <PERSON> to build on those policies, everything we've achieved will be at risk</ss>
<ss>All the work, sacrifice, and effort of the <NORP> people could end in the very same disaster that we inherited in <DATE></ss>
<ss>Because I feel so strongly about the work that must continue and the need to protect our gains for the <NORP> family and for national security, I want to share with you the qualities we should seek in the next President</ss>
<ss>We need someone who's big enough and experienced enough to handle tough and demanding negotiations with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> because this is no time to gamble with on-the-job training</ss>
<ss>We need someone who's prepared to be President and who has the commitment to stand up for you against massive new taxes and who will keep alive the hope and promise that keeps our economy strong</ss>
<ss>It'll take somebody who has seen this office from the inside, who senses the danger points, will be cool under fire, and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come</ss>
<ss>Well, that's the <PERSON> that I've seen up close, when the staff and <ORG> members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone -- someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue, someone who never runs away from a fight, never backs away from his beliefs, and never makes excuses</ss>
<ss>This office is not mine to give; only you, the people, can do that</ss>
<ss>But I love America too much and care too much about where we will be in <DATE></ss>
<ss>I care that we give custody of this office to someone who will build on our changes, not retreat to the past, someone who will continue the change all of us fought for</ss>
<ss>To preserve what we have and not risk losing it all, America needs <PERSON> -- and <PERSON> as <ORDINAL> Lady</ss>
<ss>Okay</ss>
<ss>All right</ss>
<ss>With <PERSON>, I'll know as we approach the new millennium our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protected against aggression</ss>
<ss>We'll have a prosperity that spreads the blessings of our abundance and opportunity across all America</ss>
<ss>We'll have safe and active neighborhoods, drug-free schools that send our children soaring in the atmosphere of great ideas and deep values, and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership into the uncharted reaches of a new age</ss>
<ss>So, <PERSON>, I'm in your corner</ss>
<ss>I'm ready to volunteer a little advice now and then and offer a pointer or two on strategy, if asked</ss>
<ss>I'll help keep the facts straight or just stand back and cheer</ss>
<ss>But, <PERSON>, just one personal request: Go out there and win one for the Gipper</ss>
<ss>As you can imagine, I'm sorely tempted to spend the rest of <TIME> telling the truth about our friends who met in Atlanta, but, then, why should I have all the fun?  So, for <TIME>, let's talk about the future</ss>
<ss>This is the last <NORP> convention I will address as President</ss>
<ss>Maybe you'll see your way to inviting me back sometime</ss>
<ss>But like so many of us, as I said earlier, I started out in the other party</ss>
<ss>But <DATE>, I cast my last vote as a <NORP></ss>
<ss>It was a party in which <PERSON> promised the return of power to the <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>It was a party where <PERSON> committed a strong and resolute America to preserving freedom</ss>
<ss><PERSON> had run on a platform of eliminating useless boards and commissions and returning autonomy and authority to local governments and to the <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>That party changed, and it will never be the same</ss>
<ss>They left me; I didn't leave them</ss>
<ss>So, it was our <ORG> that gave me a political home</ss>
<ss>When I signed up for duty, I didn't have to check my principles at the door</ss>
<ss>And I soon found out that the desire for victory did not overcome our devotion to ideals</ss>
<ss>And what ideals those have been</ss>
<ss>Our party speaks for human freedom, for the sweep of liberties that are at the core of our existence</ss>
<ss>We do not shirk from our duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearning millions</ss>
<ss>We believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and not through the good will of our adversaries</ss>
<ss>We have a healthy skepticism of government, checking its excesses at the same time we're willing to harness its energy when it helps improve the lives of our citizens</ss>
<ss>We have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no inherent right of <ORG></ss>
<ss>We don't think that inflation and high interest rates show compassion for the poor, the young, and the elderly</ss>
<ss>We respect the values that bind us together as families and as a nation</ss>
<ss>For our children, we don't think it's wrong to have them committed to pledging <DATE> to the "one nation, under <PERSON>, indivisible , with liberty and justice for all</ss>
<ss>" And we have so many requirements in their classrooms; why can't we at least have one thing that is, voluntary, and that is allow our kids to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start <DATE>, as <ORG> does</ss>
<ss>For the unborn, quite simply, shouldn't they be able to live to become children in those classrooms? Those are some of our principles</ss>
<ss>You in this room, and millions like you watching and listening <TIME>, are selfless and dedicated to a better world based on these principles</ss>
<ss>You aren't quitters</ss>
<ss>You walk not just precincts but for a cause</ss>
<ss>You stand for something -- the finest warriors for free government that I have known</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I thank you for letting us be a part of your tireless determination to leave a better world for our children</ss>
<ss>And that's why we're here, isn't it? A better world? I know I've said this before, but I believe that <PERSON> put this land between the two great oceans to be found by special people from every corner of the world who had that extra love for freedom that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world</ss>
<ss>It's our gift to have visions, and I want to share that of a young boy who wrote to me shortly after I took office</ss>
<ss>In his letter he said, "I love America because you can join <ORG> if you want to</ss>
<ss>You have a right to worship as you please</ss>
<ss>If you have the ability, you can try to be anything you want to be</ss>
<ss>And I also like America because we have about <MONEY>00 flavors of ice cream</ss>
<ss>" Well, truth through the eyes of a child: <ORG>, freedom of worship, freedom of hope and opportunity, and the pursuit of happiness-in this case, choosing among <MONEY>00 flavors of ice cream -- that's America, everyone with his or her vision of the <NORP> promise</ss>
<ss>That's why we're a magnet for the world: for those who dodged bullets and gave their lives coming over <FAC> and others, only a few of whom avoided death, coming in tiny boats on turbulent oceans</ss>
<ss>This land, its people, the dreams that unfold here and the freedom to bring it all together-well, those are what make America soar, up where you can see hope billowing in those freedom winds</ss>
<ss>When our children turn the pages of our lives, I hope they'll see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect as we could, where there's decency, tolerance, generosity, honesty, courage, common sense, fairness, and piety</ss>
<ss>This is my vision, and I'm grateful to <PERSON> for blessing me with a good life and a long one</ss>
<ss>But when I pack up my bags in Washington, don't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life</ss>
<ss>Twilight? Twilight? Not in America</ss>
<ss>Here, it's a sunrise every day fresh new opportunities, dreams to build</ss>
<ss>Twilight? That's not possible, because I confess there are times when I feel like I'm still little <PERSON> racing my brother down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over <LOC></ss>
<ss>You see, there's no sweeter day than each new one, because here in our country it means something wonderful can happen to you</ss>
<ss>And something wonderful happened to me</ss>
<ss>We lit a prairie fire <DATE> back</ss>
<ss>Those flames were fed by passionate ideas and convictions, and we were determined to make them run all -- burn, I should say, all across America</ss>
<ss>And what times we've had! Together we've fought for causes we love</ss>
<ss>But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battle is never over</ss>
<ss>Our freedom must be defended over and over again -- and then again</ss>
<ss>There's still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences that need repair, and horses to ride</ss>
<ss>But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim, I'll leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier</ss>
<ss>Just let me know, and I'll be there, as long as words don't leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be special during its shining moment on <LOC></ss>
<ss>Twilight, you say? Listen to <PERSON></ss>
<ss><PERSON> says: "The past is but the beginning of a beginning, and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn</ss>
<ss>" Well, that's a <DATE> -- our sunlit <DATE> -- to keep alive the fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing, we can say that we did all that could be done -- never less</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss><TIME></ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless America</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>, Mr</ss>
<ss>General Secretary, distinguished delegates: Half a world away from this place of peace, the firing, the killing, the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have, for the <ORDINAL> time in recent memory, diminished</ss>
<ss>After adding terrible new names to the roll call of human horror -- names such as Halabja, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> -- there is <DATE> hope of peace in <LOC> and <NORP>istan</ss>
<ss>So, too, in the highlands and coastal cities of southern <LOC> -- places of civil war, places of occupation by foreign troops -- talk of peace is heard, peace for the tortured nation of Angola</ss>
<ss><QUANTITY> east, in the <NORP> country of Cambodia, there is hope now of a settlement -- the removal of Vietnam's occupying forces</ss>
<ss>And finally, in this hemisphere, where <DATE> one-third of the people of <LOC> lived under democratic rule, <PERCENT> do so <DATE>; and especially in <LOC>, nations such as El Salvador, once threatened by the anarchy of the death squad and the specter of <NORP> rule, now know the hope of self-government and the prospect of economic growth</ss>
<ss>And another change, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, a change that, if it endures, may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history, a change that is a cause for shaking of the head in wonder, is also upon us -- a change going to the source of postwar tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time: <NORP>ism and thermonuclear world war</ss>
<ss>For the <ORDINAL> time, the differences between <LOC> and <LOC> -- fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the individual and whether governments shall control people or people control governments for the <ORDINAL> time, these differences have shown signs of easing, easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from places like <NORP>istan but also talk in the <LOC> of reform and greater freedom of press, of assembly, and of religion</ss>
<ss>Yes, fundamental differences remain</ss>
<ss>But should talk of reform become more than that, should it become reality, there is the prospect of not only a new era in <NORP>-<NORP> relations but a new age of world peace</ss>
<ss>For such reform can bring peace, history teaches</ss>
<ss>And my country has always believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined, war is a distant prospect</ss>
<ss>For it is not people who make war; only governments do that</ss>
<ss>I stand at this podium, then, in a moment of hope -- hope not just for the peoples of the United States or the <NORP> Union but for all the peoples of the world -- and hope, too, for the dream of peace among nations, the dream that began <ORG></ss>
<ss>Precisely because of these changes, <DATE> <ORG> has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before</ss>
<ss>Already, you, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, through your persistence, patience, and unyielding will, have shown, in working toward peace in <NORP>istan and <LOC>, how valuable <ORG> can be</ss>
<ss>And we salute you for these accomplishments</ss>
<ss>In Geneva at <TIME>, there are numerous negotiations underway -- multilateral negotiations at <FAC> as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues between the <NORP> and ourselves</ss>
<ss>And these negotiations, some of them under <PERSON> auspices, involve a broad arms control agenda -- strategic offensive weapons and space, nuclear testing and chemical warfare -- whose urgency we have witnessed anew in <DATE></ss>
<ss>And, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, the negotiators are busy</ss>
<ss>And over <DATE>, they've been engaged in more than an academic exercise</ss>
<ss>There is movement</ss>
<ss>The logjam is broken</ss>
<ss>Only recently, when the United States and the <NORP> Union signed the <ORG> agreement, an entire class of <PERSON> and <NORP> nuclear missiles was eliminated for the <ORDINAL> time in history</ss>
<ss>Progress continues on negotiations to reduce, in massive number, strategic weapons with effective verification</ss>
<ss>And talks will begin soon on conventional reductions in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Much of the reason for all of this goes back, I believe, to Geneva itself, to the small chateau along the lake where I and the General Secretary of the <NORP> Union had the <ORDINAL> of several fireside chats, exchanges characterized by frankness, but friendliness, too</ss>
<ss>I said at the <ORDINAL> meeting in Geneva that this was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to start world war III or to begin a new age of peace among nations</ss>
<ss>And I also said peace conferences, arms negotiations, proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context, a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper, underlying differences between us</ss>
<ss>I said to Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> then, as I've said to you before: Nations do not mistrust each other because they're armed; they're armed because they mistrust each other</ss>
<ss>And in that place, by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single issue of arms control but on a broader agenda about our deeper differences -- an agenda of human rights, regional conflicts, and bilateral exchanges between our peoples</ss>
<ss>Even on the arms control issue itself, we agreed to go beyond the past, to seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to higher levels but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weapons</ss>
<ss>What was begun <TIME> in Geneva has shown results -- in the <ORG> treaty; in my recent visit to Moscow; in my opportunity to meet there with <NORP> citizens and dissidents and speak of human rights, and to speak, too, in <LOC> of Moscow to the young people of the <NORP> Union about the wonder and splendor of human freedom</ss>
<ss>The results of <TIME> in Geneva are seen in peace conferences now underway around the world on regional conflicts and in the work of <ORG> here in New York as well as in Geneva</ss>
<ss>But, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, history teaches caution</ss>
<ss>Indeed, that very building in Geneva where important negotiations have taken place -- the Geneva accords on <NORP>istan, the Iran-Iraq negotiations, for example -- we see it <DATE> as stonelike testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time</ss>
<ss><ORG> was the headquarters of <ORG>, an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war</ss>
<ss>And yet <DATE> -- that institution and its noble purpose ended with <EVENT>; ended because the chance for peace was not seized in the <DATE>'s by the nations of the world; ended because humanity didn't find the courage to isolate the aggressors, to reject schemes of government that serve the state, not the people</ss>
<ss>We are here <DATE>, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, determined that no such fate shall befall <ORG></ss>
<ss>We are determined that <ORG> should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind</ss>
<ss>So, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, we realize that, even in this time of hope, the chance of failure is real</ss>
<ss>But this knowledge does not discourage us; it spurs us on</ss>
<ss>For the stakes are high</ss>
<ss>Do we falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generations? Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution and see to it that, at last, freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer and that this place, this floor, shall be truly "the world's last battlefield?" We are determined it shall be so</ss>
<ss>So, we turn now to the agenda of peace</ss>
<ss>Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> in the Kremlin, as well as on the minds of <NORP> citizens that I met in Moscow</ss>
<ss>It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this <ORG>, who this fall commemorate the <ORDINAL> anniversary of <LAW></ss>
<ss>That declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril: that peace rests on one foundation -- observing "the inalienable rights of all members of the human family</ss>
<ss>" In <DATE> where human rights have been denied by <NORP> governments on a scale never before seen in history, with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of state policy -- a history, it has been said, of blood, stupidity, and barbed wire few can wonder why peace has proved so elusive</ss>
<ss>Now, let us understand: If we would have peace, we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings</ss>
<ss>In our own land and in other lands, if we would have peace, the trampling of the human spirit must cease</ss>
<ss>Human rights is not for some, some of the time</ss>
<ss>Human rights, as the universal declaration of this <ORG> adopted in <DATE> proclaims, is "for all people and all nations," and for all time</ss>
<ss>This regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of <ORG> who starve in Ethiopia, those who die among the <NORP>, those who face racial injustice in South <LOC>, those who still cannot write or speak freely in the <NORP> Union, those who cannot worship in the Ukraine, those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in <LOC>, those who cannot publish or assemble in Managua -- all of this is more than just an agenda item on your calendar</ss>
<ss>It must be a <ORDINAL> concern, an issue above others</ss>
<ss>For when human rights concerns are not paramount at <ORG>, when <LAW> is not honored in these halls and meeting rooms, then the very credibility of this organization is at stake, the very purpose of its existence in question</ss>
<ss>That is why when human rights progress is made, <ORG> grows stronger-and the United States is glad of it</ss>
<ss>Following a 2-year effort led by the United States, for example, <ORG> took a major step toward ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past</ss>
<ss>For <DATE>, Cuba, a blatant violator of its citizens' human rights, has escaped <PERSON> censure or even scrutiny</ss>
<ss><DATE>, Cuba has responded to pressure generated by <ORG> by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has already begun to free some political prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of a small, independent national human rights group</ss>
<ss>More must be done</ss>
<ss><ORG> must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change in Cuba and elsewhere</ss>
<ss>And we must also see to it that <LAW> itself should not be debased with episodes like the "zionism is racism" resolution</ss>
<ss>Respect for human rights is the <ORDINAL> and fundamental mission of this body, the most elementary obligation of its members</ss>
<ss>Indeed, wherever one turns in the world <DATE>, there is new awareness, a growing passion for human rights</ss>
<ss>The people of the world grow <ORG>; new groups, new coalitions form -- coalitions that monitor government, that work against discrimination, that fight religious or political repression, unlawful imprisonment, torture, or execution</ss>
<ss>As those I spoke to at <ORG> said to me <DATE>, such movements make a difference</ss>
<ss>Turning now to regional conflicts, we feel again the uplift of hope</ss>
<ss>In <EVENT> between Iran and Iraq, one of the bloodiest conflicts since <EVENT>, we have a cease-fire</ss>
<ss>The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping <LOC> open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law, it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace</ss>
<ss>So, too, <ORG> decisive resolution in <DATE> <DATE> has become the blueprint for a peaceful <LOC></ss>
<ss>Let this war -- a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished, only victims-let this war end now</ss>
<ss>Let both Iran and Iraq cooperate with the Secretary-General and <ORG> in implementing <LAW></ss>
<ss>Let peace come</ss>
<ss>Moving on to a <ORDINAL> region: When I <ORDINAL> addressed <ORG> in <DATE>, world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of <NORP>istan</ss>
<ss>After <DATE> of war, the courage and determination of the <NORP> people and the <NORP> freedom fighters have held sway, and <DATE> an end to the occupation is in sight</ss>
<ss>On <DATE>, the <PERSON>S</ss>
<ss><NORP> signed the Geneva accords, which were negotiated under <PERSON> auspices by Pakistan and the Kabul regime</ss>
<ss>We encourage the <NORP> Union to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that the <NORP> people can freely determine their future without further outside interference</ss>
<ss>In southern <LOC>, too, <DATE> of patient diplomacy and support for those in Angola who seek self-determination are having their effect</ss>
<ss>We look forward to an accord between the Governments of Angola, Cuba, and South <LOC> that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops, primarily <NORP>, from Angola</ss>
<ss>We look forward as well to full implementation of <ORG> Resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence for Namibia</ss>
<ss>We continue to support a growing consensus among <NORP> leaders who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there is national reconciliation within Angola</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, there are new hopes for Cambodia, a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of <NORP>istan</ss>
<ss>We urge the rapid removal of all <NORP> troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of <ORG> to power, permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government -- a government that will, at last, respect fully the rights of the people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borne</ss>
<ss>In other critical areas, we applaud the Secretary-General's efforts to structure a referendum on the western <LOC></ss>
<ss>And in the <LOC>, direct talks between <NORP> and <NORP> Cypriot communities hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation</ss>
<ss>And finally, we look to a peaceful solution to the <NORP>-<NORP> conflict</ss>
<ss>So, too, the unnatural division of <LOC> remains a critical obstacle to <NORP>-<NORP> relations</ss>
<ss>In most of these areas, then, we see progress, and again, we're glad of it</ss>
<ss><DATE>, all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control</ss>
<ss>Indeed, the invasion of <NORP>istan and the apparent will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic, a climate the world has not seen since the <DATE>'s</ss>
<ss>Only this time, larger war was avoided, avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will</ss>
<ss>And now <ORG> is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recede</ss>
<ss>And because we're resolved to keep it so, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts</ss>
<ss>I refer here to the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community</ss>
<ss>This elite, in calling itself revolutionary, seeks no real revolution; the use of the term is subterfuge, deception for hiding the oldest, most corrupt vice of all: man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others</ss>
<ss>And that's why, as <PERSON>, I will continue to urge the <ORG> and the <NORP> public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a <NORP> regime on the people of Nicaragua, that the United States will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regime's aggression against its neighbors in <LOC></ss>
<ss><DATE> I also call on the <NORP> Union to show in <LOC> the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflicts-to assist in bringing conflict in <LOC> to a close by halting the flow of <MONEY> worth of arms and ammunition to the <NORP> regime, a regime whose goals of regional domination, while ultimately doomed, can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to <NORP>-<NORP> relations unless action is taken now</ss>
<ss>Moving now to the arms reduction agenda, I have mentioned already the importance of the <ORG> treaty and the momentum developed in the <ORG> negotiations</ss>
<ss>The draft <ORG> treaty is a lengthy document, filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides</ss>
<ss>But through <DATE> in Geneva, those brackets have diminished</ss>
<ss>There is every reason to believe this process can continue</ss>
<ss>I can tell this <ORG> that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in <DATE>, but I can tell you <DATE> is a possibility -- more than a possibility</ss>
<ss>But we have no deadline</ss>
<ss>No agreement is better than a bad agreement</ss>
<ss>The United States remains hopeful, and we acknowledge the spirit of cooperation shown by the <NORP> Union in these negotiations</ss>
<ss>We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreements</ss>
<ss>So, too, our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and space have been useful</ss>
<ss>But let me here stress to <ORG> that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control negotiations is due to technological progress itself, especially in the potential for space-based defensive systems</ss>
<ss>I believe that the United States determination to research and develop and, when ready, deploy such defensive systems -- systems targeted to destroy missiles, not people -- accounts for a large share of the progress made in <DATE> in Geneva</ss>
<ss>With such systems, for the <ORDINAL> time, in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere, major powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a saner choice: to shield against an attack instead of avenging it</ss>
<ss>So, too, as defensive systems grow in effectiveness, they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals</ss>
<ss>Only recently, briefings I have received in the <ORG> indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at <ORDINAL> thought</ss>
<ss><DATE> the United States reaffirms its commitment to its Strategic Defense Initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defenses with others</ss>
<ss>And yet, even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we've lived under in the postwar era, even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world, a terror we thought the world had put behind, a terror that looms at us now from the long-buried past, from ghostly, scarring trenches and the haunting, wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time: poison gas, chemical warfare</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, the terror of it! The horror of it! We condemn it</ss>
<ss>The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, beyond its tragic human toll, jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held those weapons in check since <EVENT> Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons</ss>
<ss>I call upon the signatories to that protocol, as well as other concerned states, to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty</ss>
<ss>And we urge all nations to cooperate in negotiating a verifiable, truly global ban on chemical weapons at <FAC> in Geneva</ss>
<ss>It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban, once and for all, and on a verifiable and global basis, the use of chemical and gas warfare</ss>
<ss>Finally, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world</ss>
<ss>Likewise, proliferation in other high-technology weapons, such as ballistic missiles, is reaching global proportions, exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications</ss>
<ss>The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate, and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons</ss>
<ss>This was a matter of discussion <DATE> between Secretary <PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Talks between <NORP> and <NORP> experts begin on this <DATE></ss>
<ss>And we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid having areas of tension like <LOC> become even more deadly battlegrounds than they already are</ss>
<ss>But in most of these areas, we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like <ORG></ss>
<ss>That is why, now more than ever, <ORG> must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and program reform</ss>
<ss><ORG> already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions, budgeting by consensus, and the establishment of program priorities</ss>
<ss>These actions are extremely important</ss>
<ss>The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions</ss>
<ss>I expect the reform program will continue and that further funds will be released in our new <DATE></ss>
<ss>And let me say here, we congratulate <ORG> on the work it has done in three areas of special concern</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism must continue</ss>
<ss>And we must also end the scourge of hostage taking</ss>
<ss><ORDINAL>, the work of <ORG> in coordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital</ss>
<ss>All international efforts in this area must be redoubled</ss>
<ss>The AIDS crisis is a grave one</ss>
<ss>We must move as one to meet it</ss>
<ss>And so, too, is the drug crisis</ss>
<ss>We're moving now toward a new anti-drug-trafficking convention</ss>
<ss>This important treaty will be completed in <DATE></ss>
<ss>I am confident other strong <PERSON> drug control programs will also follow</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> people are profoundly concerned and deeply angered</ss>
<ss>We will not tolerate the drug traffickers</ss>
<ss>We mean to make war on them, and we believe this is one war <ORG> can endorse and participate in</ss>
<ss>Yes, <ORG> is a better place than it was <DATE>, and so, too, is the world</ss>
<ss>But the real issue of reform in <ORG> is not limited just to fiscal and administrative improvements but also to a higher sort of reform, an intellectual and philosophical reform, a reform of old views about the relationship between the individual and the state</ss>
<ss>Few developments, for example, have been more encouraging to the United States than the special session this body held on <LOC> <DATE>, a session in which <ORG> joined as one in a call for free-market incentives and a lessening of state controls to spur economic development</ss>
<ss>At one of the <ORDINAL> international assemblies of my Presidency, in Cancun, Mexico, I said history demonstrates that, time and again, in place after place, economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic freedom; that individual farmers, laborers, owners, traders, and managers are the heart and soul of development</ss>
<ss>Trust them, because where they're allowed to create and build, where they're given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success, then societies become more dynamic, prosperous, progressive, and free</ss>
<ss>We believe in freedom</ss>
<ss>We know it works</ss>
<ss>And this, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General and distinguished delegates, is the immutable lesson of the postwar era: that freedom works -- even more, that freedom and peace work together</ss>
<ss><DATE> that passes, everywhere in the world, this lesson is taking hold, from the People's Republic of China to <PERSON>, from Bolivia to Botswana, and, yes, in the citadel of <WORK_OF_ART> itself</ss>
<ss>No, my country did not invent this synergy of peace and freedom, but believe me, we impose no restrictions on the free export of our more than <DATE> of experience with it</ss>
<ss>Free people blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that respect the dignity of the individual are not driven toward war or the domination of others</ss>
<ss>Here, then, is the way to world peace</ss>
<ss>And yet we <NORP> champion freedom not only because it's practical and beneficial but because it is also just, morally right</ss>
<ss>And here, Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, I hope you'll permit me to note that I have addressed this assemblage more than any of my predecessors and that this will be the last occasion I do so</ss>
<ss>So I hope, too, I may be permitted now some closing reflections</ss>
<ss>The world is currently witnessing another celebration of international cooperation</ss>
<ss>At the <EVENT> we see nations joining together in the competition of sports, and we see young people who know precious little of the resentments of their elders coming together as one</ss>
<ss>One of our young athletes from a home of modest means said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth</ss>
<ss>"We were rich as a family," she said, about the love she was given and the values she was taught</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss>Secretary-General, I dare to hope that, in the sentiment of that young athlete, we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested values: values such as family, the <ORDINAL> and most important unit of society, where all values and learning begin -- an institution to be cherished and protected; values, too, such as work, community, freedom, and faith</ss>
<ss>For it's here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world peace</ss>
<ss>And our own experience on this continent-the <NORP> experience -- though brief, has had one unmistakable encounter, an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth</ss>
<ss>It is a truth that our <ORDINAL> <PERSON>, our Founding Father, passed on in the <ORDINAL> farewell address made to the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>It is a truth that I hope now you'll permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell, a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence: that the case for inalienable rights, that the idea of human dignity, that the notion of conscience above compulsion can be made only in the context of higher law, only in the context of what one of the founders of this organization, Secretary-General <PERSON>, has called devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves</ss>
<ss>This is the endless cycle, the final truth to which humankind seems always to return: that religion and morality, that faith in something higher, are prerequisites for freedom and that justice and peace within ourselves is the <ORDINAL> step toward justice and peace in the world and for the ages</ss>
<ss>Yes, this is a place of great debate and grave discussions</ss>
<ss>And yet I cannot help but note here that one of our <ORG>, the most worldly of men, an internationalist, <PERSON>, interrupted the proceedings of our own <LAW> to make much the same point</ss>
<ss>And I cannot help but think <TIME> of other beginnings, of where and when I <ORDINAL> read those words: "And they shall beat their swords into plowshares</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>"and "your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>" <TIME>, my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life, but her most important gift was the knowledge of happiness and solace to be gained in prayer</ss>
<ss>It's the greatest help I've had in my Presidency, and I recall here <ORG>'s words when he said only the most foolish of men would think he could confront the duties of the office I now hold without turning to someone stronger, a power above all others</ss>
<ss>I think then of her and others like her in that small town in Illinois, gentle people who possessed something that those who hold positions of power sometimes forget to prize</ss>
<ss>No one of them could ever have imagined the boy from the banks of <LOC> would come to this moment and have this opportunity</ss>
<ss>But had they been told it would happen, I think they would have been a bit disappointed if I'd not spoken here for what they knew so well: that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles, when our faith in humanity falters, it is then that we must seek comfort and refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom, one greater than ourselves</ss>
<ss>And so, if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice, it will be cause for pride</ss>
<ss>But it shall be a cause of greater pride, still, if it is also said that we were wise enough to know the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies are but overture, that the truly majestic music -- the music of freedom, of justice, and peace -- is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in silence the will of Him who made us</ss>
<ss>Thank you for your hospitality over <DATE></ss>
<ss>I bid you now farewell, and God bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Thank you very much, thank you</ss>
<ss>Please be seated</ss>
<ss>Those who live <DATE> remember those who do not</ss>
<ss>Those who know freedom remember <DATE> those who gave up life for freedom</ss>
<ss><DATE>, in honor of the dead, we conduct ceremonies</ss>
<ss>We lay wreaths</ss>
<ss>We speak words of tribute</ss>
<ss>And in our memories, in our hearts, we hold them close to us still</ss>
<ss>Yet we also know, even as their families knew when they last looked upon them, that they can never be fully ours again, that they belong now to <PERSON> and to that for which they so selflessly made a final and eternal act of devotion</ss>
<ss>We could not forget them</ss>
<ss>Even if they were not our own, we could not forget them</ss>
<ss>For all time, they are what we can only aspire to be: giving, unselfish, the epitome of human love-to lay down one's life so that others might live</ss>
<ss>We think on their lives</ss>
<ss>We think on their final moments</ss>
<ss>In our mind's eye, we see young <NORP> in a <NORP> forest or on an <NORP> island or at sea or in aerial combat</ss>
<ss>And as life expired, we know that those who could had last thoughts of us and of their love for us</ss>
<ss>As they thought of us then, so, too, we think of them now, with love, with devotion, and with faith: the certainty that what they died for was worthy of their sacrifice-faith, too, in <PERSON> and in the Nation that has pledged itself to His work and to the dream of human freedom, and a nation, too, that <DATE> and always pledges itself to their eternal memory</ss>
<ss>Thank you</ss>
<ss><PERSON> bless you</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>Well, thank you very much for that warm welcome</ss>
<ss>Governor <PERSON>, <ORG>man <PERSON>, and my very special thanks, too, to Senator <PERSON> and President <PERSON> for suggesting this invitation</ss>
<ss>And you know, as President, I have certain privileges</ss>
<ss>So, I checked with President <PERSON>, and I'm delighted to announce that starting <TIME> you all have <DATE> off</ss>
<ss>But here at <ORG>, we are surrounded with memories of <PERSON></ss>
<ss>One of my staff mentioned that <PERSON> favorite recreation was horseback riding, and I said he was a wise man</ss>
<ss>And another member of the staff said that <PERSON> thought <FAC> was a noble edifice, and I said he was a man of refined taste</ss>
<ss>And a <ORDINAL> staff member noted that, after retiring as President, <PERSON>, in his seventies, didn't sit back and rest, but founded <ORG>; and I said: There's always an overachiever which makes it hard for the rest of us</ss>
<ss>But no speaker can come to these grounds or see the <PERSON> without appreciating the symmetry not just of the architecture but of the mind that created it</ss>
<ss>The man to whom that mind belonged is known to you as Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>And I think the familiarity of that term is justified; his influence here is everywhere</ss>
<ss>And yet, while those of you at <ORG> are fortunate to have before you physical reminders of the power of your founder's intellect and imagination, it should be remembered that all you do here, indeed, all of higher education in America, bears signs, too, of his transforming genius</ss>
<ss>The pursuit of science, the study of the great works, the value of free inquiry, in short, the very idea of the living the life of the mind -- yes, these formative and abiding principles of higher education in America had their <ORDINAL> and firmest advocate, and their greatest embodiment, in a tall, fair-headed, friendly man who watched this university take form from the mountainside where he lived, the university whose founding he called a crowning achievement to a long and well-spent life</ss>
<ss>Well, you're not alone in feeling his presence</ss>
<ss>Presidents know about this, too</ss>
<ss>You've heard many times that during <DATE> of his Presidency, <PERSON> said to a group of <WORK_OF_ART> laureates in <FAC> of <FAC> that there had not been such a collection of talent in that place since <PERSON> dined there alone</ss>
<ss>And directly down the lawn and across the Ellipse from <FAC> are those ordered, classic lines of <FAC> and the eyes of the 19-foot statue that gaze directly into <FAC>, a reminder to any of us who might occupy that mansion of the quality of mind and generosity of heart that once abided there and has been so rarely seen there again</ss>
<ss>But it's not just students and Presidents, it is every <NORP> -- indeed, every human life ever touched by the daring idea of self-government -- that Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has influenced</ss>
<ss>Yes, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was obliged to admit all previous attempts at popular government had proven themselves failures</ss>
<ss>But he believed that here on this continent, as one of his commentators put it, ``here was virgin soil, an abundance of land, no degrading poverty, a brave and intelligent people which had just vindicated its title to independence after a long struggle with the mightiest of <NORP> powers</ss>
<ss>'' Well, here was another chance, an opportunity for enlightened government, government based on the principles of reason and tolerance, government that left to the people the fruits of their labor and the pursuit of their own definition of happiness in the form of commerce or education or religion</ss>
<ss>And so, it's no wonder he asked that his epitaph read simply: ``Here was born  <PERSON>, Author of the Declaration of  Independence, of <ORG> for religious freedom, and Father of <ORG></ss>
<ss>'' Well, as that epitaph shows, for all his learning and bookishness, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was a practical man, a man who made things, things like a university, a <ORG> government, a <ORG></ss>
<ss>In founding and sustaining these institutions, he wanted them to be based on the same symmetry, the same balance of mind and faith in human creativity evidenced in the <PERSON></ss>
<ss>He had known personal tragedy</ss>
<ss>He knew how disorderly a place the world could be</ss>
<ss>Indeed, as a leader of a rebellion, he was himself an architect, if you will, of disorder</ss>
<ss>But he also believed that man had received from God a precious gift of enlightenment -- the gift of reason, a gift that could extract from the chaos of life meaning, truth, order</ss>
<ss>Just as we see in his architecture, the balancing of circular with linear, of rotunda with pillar, we see in his works of government the same disposition toward balance, toward symmetry and harmony</ss>
<ss>He knew successful self-government meant bringing together disparate interests and concerns, balancing, for example, on the one hand, the legitimate duties of government -- the maintenance of domestic order and protection from foreign menace -- with government's tendency to preempt its citizens' rights, take the fruits of their labors, and reduce them ultimately to servitude</ss>
<ss>So he knew that governing meant balance, harmony</ss>
<ss>And he knew from personal experience the danger posed to such harmony by the voices of unreason, special privilege, partisanship, or intolerance</ss>
<ss>And I do mean personal experience</ss>
<ss>You see, despite all of <PERSON> warnings about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit, <NORP> and <NORP> were constantly at each other in <DATE></ss>
<ss>The <NORP> of the <LOC> had held power for a long time and were not anxious to relinquish it</ss>
<ss><DATE>, a New York <ORG>man honored <DATE> when, as he put it, <WORK_OF_ART> could knock a <NORP> down in the streets of New York and not be questioned about it</ss>
<ss>'' The <NORP> referred to Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> as -- and here I quote -- ``a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, raised wholly on hotcake made of coarse-ground <NORP> corn, bacon, and hominy, with an occasional fricasseed bullfrog</ss>
<ss>''  Well, by the way -- was the <DATE> equivalent of what I believe is known here at <ORG> as a Gus Burger</ss>
<ss>And an editorial in the Federalist Connecticut Courant also announced that as soon as Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> was elected, ``Murder, robbery, rape, and adultery and incest will be openly taught and practiced</ss>
<ss>''  Well, that was politics in <DATE></ss>
<ss>So, you see, not all that much has changed</ss>
<ss>Actually, I've taken a moment for these brief reflections on <PERSON> and his time precisely because there are such clear parallels to our own</ss>
<ss>We too have seen a new populism in America, not at all unlike that of <PERSON>'s time</ss>
<ss>We've seen the growth of a <PERSON>-like populism that rejects the burden placed on the people by excessive regulation and taxation; that rejects the notion that judgeships should be used to further privately held beliefs not yet approved by the people; and finally, rejects, too, the notion that foreign policy must reflect only the rarefied concerns of Washington rather than the common sense of a people who can frequently see far more plainly dangers to their freedom and to our national well-being</ss>
<ss>It is this latter point that brings me to <ORG> <DATE></ss>
<ss>There has been much change in <DATE> in our foreign relations; and <DATE>, when I spoke to <ORG>, I summarized much of the progress we've seen in such matters as the human rights agenda, arms reduction, and resolving those regional conflicts that might lead to wider war</ss>
<ss>I will not recite all of this here again <DATE>, but I do want you to know I found in the delegates afterward a warmth that I had not seen before -- let me assure you, not due to any eloquence on my part but just a simple perception on their part that there is a chance for an opening, a new course in human events</ss>
<ss>I think I detected a sense of excitement, even perhaps like that felt by those who lived in <PERSON>'s time: a sense of new possibilities for the idea of popular government</ss>
<ss>Only this time, it's not just a single nation at issue: It is the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper</ss>
<ss><DATE>, this would have seemed the most outlandish and dreamiest of prospects</ss>
<ss>But consider for just a moment the striving for democracy that we have seen in places like the Philippines, Burma, Korea, Chile, Poland, South <LOC> -- even places like China and the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>One of the great, unnoticed -- and yet most startling -- developments of <DATE> is this: More of the world's populace is <DATE> living in relative freedom than ever before in history; more and more nations are turning to freely elected <NORP> governments</ss>
<ss>The statistics themselves are compelling</ss>
<ss>According to one organization, <ORG>, in <DATE> the number of countries called not free declined from 71 to 50</ss>
<ss>And the countries classified as free or partly free increased from 92 to 117</ss>
<ss>When you consider that, according to the <ORG> count, <PERCENT> of those not living in freedom are in China and the <NORP> Union -- and even in those nations, as I say, we see glimpses of hope -- the picture is even brighter</ss>
<ss>The most dramatic movement of all has taken place: <PERCENT> of the people are now living in countries that are <NORP> or headed in that direction</ss>
<ss>This <NORP> revolution has been accompanied by a change in economic thinking comparable to <EVENT> in physics, and that is no accident</ss>
<ss>Free-market economies have worked miracles in several nations of <LOC></ss>
<ss>A <ORG> special session on <LOC> has called for more market-oriented structural reform in that region</ss>
<ss>In <LOC> the tide is against state ownership of property</ss>
<ss>And even in China and the <NORP> Union the theoretical underpinnings of <NORP> economics are being reexamined</ss>
<ss>In this atmosphere, we've continued to emphasize prudent but deepening development of economic ties which are critical to our economic health in the conduct of our foreign policy</ss>
<ss>In our own hemisphere, we're about to implement an historic free trade agreement between the United <ORG>s and Canada that could well serve as a model for the world</ss>
<ss>These <NORP> and free-market revolutions are really the same revolution</ss>
<ss>They are based on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom and on the <NORP> idea that freedom is indivisible, that government's attempts to encroach on that freedom -- whether it be through political restrictions on the rights of assembly, speech, or publication, or economic repression through high taxation and excessive bureaucracy -- have been the principal institutional barrier to human progress</ss>
<ss>But if this remarkable revolution has not been obvious to many, certainly one other eye-opening change has been self-evident</ss>
<ss>Consider for just a moment the sights we've seen <DATE>: an <NORP> President with his <NORP> counterpart strolling through <FAC> and talking to passers-by about war and peace; an <NORP> President there in <LOC> of Moscow speaking to the students of <ORG>, young people like yourselves, about the wonder and splendor of human freedom; an <NORP> President, <DATE>, with a future <NORP> President and the President of the <NORP> Union standing in New York Harbor, looking up at <PERSON>, hearing again the prayer on the lips of all those millions who once passed that way in hope of a better life and future -- a prayer of peace and freedom for all humanity</ss>
<ss>And, yes, even <DATE> in the devastation of Armenia, <NORP> and <NORP> making common cause, as we once made common cause against another terrible enemy <DATE></ss>
<ss>But it's not the visuals and the sound bites that matter</ss>
<ss>Behind all of this is a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment</ss>
<ss>One of those visuals you've seen in <DATE> is the signing of accords between Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and me and the destruction of <NORP> and <NORP> missiles</ss>
<ss>It was more than just good television, more than just action news</ss>
<ss>The <ORG> treaty is the <ORDINAL> accord in history to eliminate an entire class of <PERSON> and <NORP> nuclear missiles</ss>
<ss>And the <ORG> treaty, which deals with far larger arsenals of long-range -- or what the experts call strategic -- weapons, calls for 50-percent reductions in such weapons</ss>
<ss>In Geneva, where the portions of the draft treaty disputed by one side or the other are put in brackets, we are slowly seeing those brackets disappear</ss>
<ss>So, the treaty is coming closer</ss>
<ss>And so, too, there's progress on nuclear-testing agreements and chemical weapons, and we're about to begin new negotiations on the conventional balance in <LOC></ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s recent announcement at the <PERSON> about troop reductions was most welcome and appreciated, but it's important to remember this is a part of and the result of a larger disarmament process set in motion <DATE></ss>
<ss>Another area where the achievements are visible is that of regional conflicts</ss>
<ss>In Afghanistan, we've seen a settlement leading towards <NORP> withdrawal</ss>
<ss>In Cambodia, the <ORDINAL> steps have been taken toward withdrawal of <NORP> troops</ss>
<ss>In Brazzaville,justthisTuesday,<NORP> accord was signed that will send some 50,000 <NORP> soldiers home from Angola -- the <ORDINAL> reversal of <NORP> military imperialism after our rescue of Grenada in <DATE></ss>
<ss>In the matter of human rights, we've also seen extraordinary progress: the release of some political prisoners in the <NORP> Union, initial steps toward a reduction of state economic controls and more politically representative forms of government, some greater scope to publish and speak critically, an increase in emigration, and visible steps toward greater religious freedom</ss>
<ss>And finally, in our bilateral exchanges, we're seeing more <NORP> and <NORP> citizens visiting each other's land and a greater interchange of scientific, cultural, and intellectual traditions</ss>
<ss>The summits themselves are indications of the progress we've made here</ss>
<ss>I look to <DATE> when the meetings between the leaders of the <NORP> Union and the United <ORG>s will be regular and frequent and maybe not quite so newsworthy</ss>
<ss>Where we're strong, steadfast; we succeed</ss>
<ss>In <LOC>, the United <ORG>s made clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interests</ss>
<ss>And this helped hasten an end to <EVENT></ss>
<ss>And the country stood firm for <DATE>, insisting that the <ORG> had to accept Israel's right to exist, sign on to Resolutions 242 and 338, and renounce terrorism</ss>
<ss>And now that resolve has paid off</ss>
<ss>Now the <NORP> revolution that I talked about earlier and all the change and movement and, yes, breakthroughs that I've just cited on the diplomatic front can be directly attributed to the restoration of confidence on the part of <NORP> nations</ss>
<ss>There can be little doubt that in <DATE> of the eighties the cause of freedom and human rights has prospered and the specter of nuclear war has been pushed back because the democracies have recovered their strength -- their compass</ss>
<ss>Here at home, a national consensus on the importance of strong <NORP> leadership is emerging</ss>
<ss>As I said before the <ORG> at <DATE>: No legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place such a consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of <NORP> power from ever occurring again</ss>
<ss>Now, I think much of the reason for all of this has to do with the new coherence and clarity that we've brought to our foreign policy, a new coherence based on a strong reaffirmation of values by the allied nations</ss>
<ss>The same idea that so energized Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and the other founders of this nation -- the idea of popular government -- has driven the revival of the <LOC> and a renewal of its values and its beliefs in itself</ss>
<ss>But now the question: How do we keep the world moving toward the idea of popular government? Well, <DATE> I offer three thoughts -- reflections and warnings at the same time -- on how the <NORP>-<NORP> relationship can continue to improve and how the cause of peace and freedom can be served</ss>
<ss>First, the <NORP>-<NORP> relationship: Once marked by sterility and confrontation, this relationship is now characterized by dialog -- realistic, candid dialog -- serious diplomatic progress, and the sights and sounds of summitry</ss>
<ss>All of this is heady, inspiring</ss>
<ss>And yet my <ORDINAL> reflection for you <DATE> is: All of it is still in doubt</ss>
<ss>And the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent is to remember we're not there yet</ss>
<ss>Serious problems, fundamental differences remain</ss>
<ss>Our system is one of checks and balances</ss>
<ss>Theirs, for all its reforms, remains a one-party authoritarian system that institutionalizes the concentration of power</ss>
<ss>Our foreign relations embrace this expanding world of democracy that I've described</ss>
<ss>Theirs can be known by the company they keep: Cuba, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Libya, Vietnam, North Korea</ss>
<ss>Yes, we welcome Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s recent announcement of a troop reduction, but let us remember that the <NORP> preponderance in military power in <LOC> remains, an asymmetry that offends our <NORP> senses and endangers our future</ss>
<ss>So, we must keep our heads, and that means keeping our skepticism</ss>
<ss>We must realize that what has brought us here has not been easy, not for ourselves nor for all of those who have sacrificed and contributed to the cause of freedom in the postwar era</ss>
<ss>So, this means in our treaty negotiations, as I've said: Trust, but verify</ss>
<ss>I'm not a linguist, but I learned to say that much <NORP> and have used it in frequent meetings with Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>: ``<PERSON> no provorey</ss>
<ss>'' It means keeping our military strong</ss>
<ss>It means remembering no treaty is better than a bad treaty</ss>
<ss>It means remembering the accords of Moscow and Washington summits followed <DATE> of standing firm on our principles and our interests, and those of our allies</ss>
<ss>And finally, we need to recall that in <DATE> of detente we tended to forget the greatest weapon the democracies have in their struggle is public candor: the truth</ss>
<ss>We must never do that again</ss>
<ss>It's not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental differences between totalitarianism and democracy; it's a moral imperative</ss>
<ss>It doesn't slow down the pace of negotiations; it moves them forward</ss>
<ss>Throughout history, we see evidence that adversaries negotiate seriously with <NORP> nations only when they knew the democracies harbor no illusions about those adversaries</ss>
<ss>A <ORDINAL> reflection I have on all this concerns some recent speculation that what is happening in the <NORP> Union was in its way inevitable, that since the death of Stalin the <NORP> state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence</ss>
<ss>I think this is wrong</ss>
<ss>It's also dangerous, because what we see in the <NORP> Union <DATE> is a change of a different order than in the past</ss>
<ss>For example, whatever the <PERSON> era may or may not have represented in <NORP> internal politics, we know how aspirations for greater freedom were crushed in Poland and Germany and, even more bloodily, in Hungary</ss>
<ss>We also saw the construction of <FAC></ss>
<ss>We saw Cuba become an active client state, a client state spreading subversion throughout <LOC> and bringing the entire world to the brink of war with the ``missiles of <DATE></ss>
<ss>'' And let me assure you, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> gave no speeches at the <PERSON> like that recently given by Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>As one <NORP> <PERSON> official said about <PERSON> appearances there: ``We were never quite sure whether it was, indeed, Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s shoe being used to pound the <NORP> desk or whether Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s shoe had been borrowed or whether there was an extra shoe kept under the <NORP> podium especially for banging purposes</ss>
<ss>''  Now, all of this was hardly encouraging for the growth of freedom and the path to peace</ss>
<ss>We know too what happened in the <PERSON> era: greater and greater expansionism; Afghanistan; economic decay and overwhelming corruption; a greater and greater burden on the peoples of the <NORP> Union, on all the peoples of the world</ss>
<ss>Now this is changing</ss>
<ss>How much and how fast it will change we do not know</ss>
<ss>I would like to think that actions by this country, particularly our willingness to make ourselves clear -- our expressions of firmness and will evidenced by our plain talk, strong defenses, vibrant alliances, and readiness to use <NORP> power when <NORP> power was needed -- helped to prompt the reappraisal that <NORP> leaders have undertaken of their previous policies</ss>
<ss>Even more, <LOC>ern resolve demonstrated that the hardline advocated by some within the <NORP> Union would be fruitless, just as our economic successes have set a shining example</ss>
<ss>As I suggested in <DATE>, if the <LOC> maintained its strength, we would see economic needs clash with the political order in the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>This has happened</ss>
<ss>But it could not have happened if the <LOC> had not maintained -- indeed, strengthened -- its will, its commitment to world freedom</ss>
<ss>So, there was nothing inevitable about all of this</ss>
<ss>Human actions made the difference</ss>
<ss>Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> has taken some daring steps</ss>
<ss>As I've said before, this is the <ORDINAL> <NORP> leader not to make world revolution a priority</ss>
<ss>Well, let us credit those steps</ss>
<ss>Let us credit him</ss>
<ss>And let us remember, too, that the democracies, with their strength and resolve and candor, have also made a difference</ss>
<ss>And this is the heart of my point: What happens in <DATE>, whether all this progress is continued or ended -- this is, in large part, up to us</ss>
<ss>It's why now, more then ever, we must not falter</ss>
<ss><NORP> power must be exercised morally, of course, but it must also be exercised, and exercised effectively</ss>
<ss>For the cause of peace and freedom in the eighties, that power made all the difference</ss>
<ss>The nineties will prove no different</ss>
<ss>And this brings us to my <ORDINAL> point: the relationship between the <ORG> and the <ORG></ss>
<ss>It's precisely where <ORG> and the President have worked together -- as in Afghanistan and Cambodia, or resolved differences, as in Angola, <LOC>, and many aspects of <LOC> relations -- precisely there, our policies have succeeded, and we see progress</ss>
<ss>But where <ORG> and the President have engaged each other as adversaries, as over <LOC>, <PERSON> policies have faltered and our common purposes have not been achieved</ss>
<ss><ORG>' on-again, off-again indecisiveness on resisting <NORP> tyranny and aggression has left <LOC> a region of continuing danger</ss>
<ss>Sometimes congressional actions in foreign affairs have had the effect of institutionalizing that kind of adversarial relationship</ss>
<ss>We see it in <EVENT>, in the attempted restrictions on the President's power to implement treaties, and on trade policy</ss>
<ss>We see it in the attempt to manage complex issues of foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation -- such as unduly restrictive intelligence oversight, limits on arms transfers, and earmarking of <PERCENT> of our foreign assistance -- denying a President the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly changing conditions</ss>
<ss>Even in arms reduction, a President's ability to succeed depends on congressional support for military modernization -- sometimes attempts are made to weaken my hand</ss>
<ss>The Founding Fathers understood the need for effectiveness, coherence, consistency, and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affairs</ss>
<ss>As <PERSON> himself said: ``The transaction of business with foreign nations is <ORG> altogether</ss>
<ss>It belongs, then, to the head of that department, except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted to the <ORG></ss>
<ss>Exceptions are to be construed strictly</ss>
<ss>'' Well, the President and the Vice President are elected by all the people</ss>
<ss>So, too, is the <ORG> as a collegial body</ss>
<ss>All who are elected to serve in these coordinate departments of our <ORG> have one unmistakable and undeniable mandate: to preserve, protect, and defend the <LAW></ss>
<ss>To this -- this foremost -- they must always be attentive</ss>
<ss>For a President, it means protecting his office and its place in our constitutional framework</ss>
<ss>In doing that, the President is accountable to the people in the most direct way, accountable to history and to his own conscience</ss>
<ss>The President and <ORG>, to be sure, share many responsibilities</ss>
<ss>But their roles are not the same</ss>
<ss><ORG> alone, for example, has the power of the purse</ss>
<ss>The President is chief executive, chief diplomat, and commander in chief</ss>
<ss>How these great branches of government perform their legitimate roles is critically important to the <ORG>'s ability to succeed, nowhere more so than in the field of foreign affairs</ss>
<ss>They need each other and must work together in common cause with all deference, but within their separate spheres</ss>
<ss><DATE> we live in a world in which America no longer enjoys preponderant power, but must lead by example and persuasion; a world of pressing new challenges to our economic prosperity; a world of new opportunities for peace and of new dangers</ss>
<ss>In such a world, more than ever, America needs strong and consistent leadership, and the strength and resilience of the Presidency are vital</ss>
<ss>I think if we can keep these concerns in mind during <DATE> public debate and support will be enhanced and America's foreign policy will continue to prosper</ss>
<ss>All of us know the terrible importance of maintaining the progress we've made in <DATE> of the eighties</ss>
<ss>We're moving away from war and confrontation toward peace and freedom, and <DATE> toward a future beyond the imaginings of the past</ss>
<ss>These are the stakes</ss>
<ss>Some may find such prospects daunting</ss>
<ss>I think you should find them challenging and exciting</ss>
<ss>And I think you can see that in all of this you and your country will have a special role to play</ss>
<ss>The issue before the world is still the same as the one that <PERSON> faced so squarely and so memorably: Can human beings manage their own affairs? Is self-determination and popular, representative government possible? Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s work and life amounted to a great, mighty assent to that question</ss>
<ss>So, too, will yours and America's if we can keep in mind the greatest and last lesson of <PERSON>'s life</ss>
<ss>And it has something to do with what I just spoke to -- about the <ORG> and <ORG></ss>
<ss>I'm fond of recollecting that in <DATE> of their lives <PERSON> and <PERSON>, who had worked so hard and well together for the <ORG>'s independence, both came to regret that they had let partisan differences come between them</ss>
<ss>For <DATE> their estrangement lasted</ss>
<ss>But then, when both retired, <PERSON> at <DATE> to <LOC> and <ORG> at <DATE> to Quincy, they began through their letters to speak again to each other, letters that discussed almost every conceivable subject: gardening, horseback riding, even sneezing as a cure for hiccups --  -- but other subjects as well: the loss of loved ones; the mystery of grief and sorrow; the importance of religion; and, of course, the last thoughts, the final hopes of two old men, two great patriarchs, for the country that they had helped to found and loved so deeply</ss>
<ss>"It carries me back," <PERSON> wrote about his correspondence with his cosigner of <WORK_OF_ART>, ``to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man: his right to self-government</ss>
<ss>Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us and yet passing harmless we rowed through the storm with heart and hand</ss>
<ss>'' It was their last gift to us, this lesson in tolerance for each other, in charity, this insight into America's strength as a nation</ss>
<ss>And when both died on <DATE>, within <TIME> of each other, the date was <DATE>, <DATE> exactly after that <ORDINAL> gift to us: <WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>A great future is ours and the world's if we but remember the power of those words Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON> penned not just for <NORP> but for all humanity: ``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their <PERSON> with certain inalienable <PRODUCT>, that among these are Life, <ORG> and the pursuit of <ORG></ss>
<ss>'' Thank you, and God bless you</ss>
<ss>Well, we want to help promote this democracy in the <NORP> Union, but I believe that we've got to proceed by watching whether deeds match the words</ss>
<ss>Now, in some instances, they certainly have -- permitting me, for example, to speak to the students at <ORG></ss>
<ss>I found out afterward, however, that they couldn't get all the student body in, only a few hundred</ss>
<ss>So, they decided that the few hundred would be those who were members of <ORG></ss>
<ss>But Ithink that there are differences between us and with this man</ss>
<ss>When we had the <ORDINAL> summit at Geneva, and I'll try not to make my answers this long again, people more experienced in this who would be on our team told me that if we could get just the agreement to a <ORDINAL> summit that the summit would be worthwhile</ss>
<ss>Well, I had an idea of my own in the <ORDINAL> meeting</ss>
<ss>And as we sat, they on their side of the table and my team on ours, I looked across the table at the General Secretary -- you know, I don't know which to call him; he's got three titles now: General Secretary, President, and Chairman --  -- then he was the General Secretary -- and I suggested that why didn't we leave our teams here to start talking -- the subject that was raised was disarmament -- and why didn't he and I go out and get some air? Well, he jumped up before I even finished speaking</ss>
<ss>And out we went</ss>
<ss>And it was planned; there was a fire in the fireplace</ss>
<ss>It was very cold <DATE> -- down in a little house along the lake from below where we were -- so we walked down</ss>
<ss>And for <TIME>, he and I had a meeting and a discussion</ss>
<ss>And then we decided we'd better get back up to the regular meeting</ss>
<ss>And we were just outside the building, and he said something to me about that I had never seen Russia</ss>
<ss>And I turned to him and said, ``And you have never seen the United <ORG>s</ss>
<ss>You've never been in the United <ORG>s before</ss>
<ss>'' I said, ``We're having the summit here</ss>
<ss>Why don't we have the next summit in the United <ORG>s, and I hereby invite you?'' And he said, ``I accept</ss>
<ss>'' And he said, ``Then why don't we have the following one in <DATE> in the <NORP> Union?'' I said, ``I accept</ss>
<ss>'' Well, when I told our people that we were already scheduled for two more summits --  -- in our two countries, they almost fell down</ss>
<ss>They couldn't believe it</ss>
<ss>So, immediately we saw a great difference between this man and the previous leaders of the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>You see, I hadn't had much chance to meet with them</ss>
<ss>They kept dying on me</ss>
<ss>Middle East Peace Efforts     Well, it is merely a step forward to that because peace, which does not exist there -- most people forget that those countries are still technically are in a state of war with each other -- it's only going to come when the principals come together to negotiate</ss>
<ss>Outside, we have been trying to help, and internationally and so forth, with the other nations</ss>
<ss>And this has been a great step forward</ss>
<ss>And again, it was similar to our using strength and sticking to our purpose in other areas that brought it about</ss>
<ss>We had said from the very <ORDINAL> that there were these main points, the 242 and 338  resolutions, the recognition of Israel's right to exist as a nation -- which had never been advanced before -- and things of this kind that had to be agreed to before we could have a dialog with the <ORG>, which was the principal opponent</ss>
<ss>And when that took place, as it just did for the <ORDINAL> time, clearly and without fuzzing it up with ambiguous dialog, when they met those terms, we said yes</ss>
<ss>And already the process is going forward to arrange for that dialog</ss>
<ss>But the peace must be brought about by the principals in the dispute, and we're hoping that this now is the main step that will lead us toward that</ss>
<ss>Terrorism     Well, I think that the next administration -- if I'm correct in your question there -- yes, will continue the policy</ss>
<ss>We adopted a policy of complete resistance to terrorism: no recognition of a country that supported it -- and there were countries that did</ss>
<ss>And I think an example, the shortest example that I can give you, was when we had the irrefutable proof that <PERSON> of Libya had been responsible for terrorism that took the lives of a number of people at an airport in <LOC>, including some <NORP> -- we responded</ss>
<ss>And I'm going to knock on wood -- just one more line on that</ss>
<ss>Since that response, there has been no <NORP> terrorist move against any -- -- Advice to Youth   I know I speak for many of us when I say your words carry very special significance</ss>
<ss>What advice do you offer us as we approach a new century in an ever more uncertain future?>   Oh! Oh!  The age group 18 to 24 among voters is the one that is most definitely in support of the type of things that we've been doing in <DATE></ss>
<ss>But now, I have to say to you, it is the age group also in which the fewest number, or proportion, vote</ss>
<ss>So, I would suggest to you -- because it's your world that we're talking about, and if you haven't gotten around to registering or bothering to vote, or you know someone that hasn't, make sure that age group of yours, who are going to have to take over the reins of government pretty soon -- that you make your views known in the polling place</ss>
<ss>I think this is most vital</ss>
<ss>And then, oh, I could lobby for an awful lot of things --  -- like a balanced budget amendment and a line-item veto</ss>
<ss>Your Governor has that</ss>
<ss>I had it when I was Governor of California -- the line-item veto</ss>
<ss>Administration Accomplishments   Thank you for your advice</ss>
<ss>I'd like to know what you feel are your most significant accomplishments in the areas of, number one, foreign policy, and, number two, domestic policy?>   What do I feel was the most important accomplishment? Well, I think in both of those that we have redressed in foreign policy our strength</ss>
<ss>When I took office, on any given day, half of the military aircraft of the United <ORG>s couldn't fly for lack of spare parts</ss>
<ss>Half of the ships in our <ORG> couldn't leave port for much the same reason, or lack of crew</ss>
<ss>And I immediately met with <ORG> and wanted to talk to them about restoring a patriotism where the young men and women in uniform wouldn't feel they had to get into civilian clothes when they left the base, but would be proud to be seen wearing the uniform</ss>
<ss><DATE> a higher percentage of our military are high school graduates -- and it's a volunteer military -- than ever in our history</ss>
<ss>And there are three intelligence brackets used in the military for the assignment of people as to what proper functions and so forth -- the highest percentage in the top intelligence bracket that we have ever known before in our military</ss>
<ss>And of all the things I'm proud of, I'm proud of the young men and women who are wearing our uniform more than anything</ss>
<ss>But this redressing of that -- but also, I came into office thinking that -- for some time I was thinking that there was a hunger for a spiritual revival in America, and I think that has taken place</ss>
<ss>I hear from more and more people talking about the pride they have in country</ss>
<ss>On the economic front -- I got a degree in economics</ss>
<ss>I didn't deserve it, but I got it</ss>
<ss>But I took away -- I remembered something that happened <DATE> --  -- and it was a man named <PERSON> in Egypt</ss>
<ss>I didn't know they had economists then, but <PERSON> said that at the beginning of the empire the tax rates were low and the revenue was great</ss>
<ss>At the end of the empire, the rates were great and the revenue was low</ss>
<ss>So, I came away with the belief that you didn't gain revenue by raising taxes</ss>
<ss>And in fact, our whole national experience proves it</ss>
<ss>When <PERSON> took to tax reductions, the revenue of the <ORG> increased</ss>
<ss>And the same thing happened to a certain extent with President <PERSON>'s tax reduction, which was similar to ours</ss>
<ss>So, one of my <ORDINAL> goals was to unleash the economy of this country and get government off the backs and out of an adversarial relationship with the private sector so that the people of this country could do with their freedom what they were intended to do</ss>
<ss>That's all we really have done in this administration: We got out of your way</ss>
<ss>And we have these people that still say that we have a target of <DATE> for a balanced budget</ss>
<ss>And we're meeting that target on every step now</ss>
<ss>But these people that still are talking that we're going to have to raise taxes -- they'll undo the great economic reform</ss>
<ss>We have created almost 19 million new jobs in <DATE> of economic reform</ss>
<ss>This personal disposable income after taxes has risen higher than it ever was before</ss>
<ss>And government revenues from the income tax increased by <MONEY> since we implemented our tax reform and our tax cut</ss>
<ss>The trouble is spending increased <MONEY></ss>
<ss>I haven't had a budget yet</ss>
<ss>By law I have to submit a budget <DATE></ss>
<ss>I do, and present company excepted, the <ORG> just puts it on the shelf and sends me a continuing resolution of their own doing</ss>
<ss>So, I think the great economic recovery</ss>
<ss>I have had the pleasure of facing a number of our trading partners, the heads of state of our trading partners -- Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and on and on -- in a meeting and had them -- I was the new kid in school</ss>
<ss>They'd all been there longer than I had</ss>
<ss>And they were sitting there silently, and then one of them, a spokesman, said, Tell us about the <NORP> miracle</ss>
<ss>Well, the <NORP> miracle was simply the unleashing of resources, and the last point was regulations</ss>
<ss><PERSON> I put in charge of a task force to see how many government regulations he could eliminate</ss>
<ss>He eliminated so many that our estimate <DATE> is that the paperwork imposed upon you and on community governments and on <ORG> <ORG>s has been reduced by 600 million <TIME> a year</ss>
<ss>Well, I got too long on that answer</ss>
<ss>President's Future Plans     Well, you know, in Hollywood if you don't sing or dance, you wind up as an after-dinner speaker</ss>
<ss>And so, that was my personal appearance role -- was a speaker out there on the mashed-potato circuit</ss>
<ss>And there are always -- I think for everyone who ever leaves this post there are things you didn't get done</ss>
<ss>And I think I'll be out on the mashed-potato circuit again, extolling the virtues of line-item veto and a balanced budget amendment --  -- and again, defending the right of us to maintain our military defenses and so forth</ss>
<ss>And I'm very tempted about the idea -- somebody's talking to me about doing a book</ss>
<ss>And there are some backstage stories that I might enjoy getting out</ss>
<ss>But I'm going to be active</ss>
<ss>I'm not going to be up at the ranch any more than -- much that I've been able to on the visits that I occasionally make there</ss>
<ss>But I'm going to be active</ss>
<ss>And I know that <PERSON>'s going to continue her activity in the antidrug campaign, too</ss>
<ss>Were you the last one, or is there a <ORDINAL>? Did I miscount? Mr</ss>
<ss><PERSON></ss>
<ss>That was the <ORDINAL></ss>
<ss>That was the <ORDINAL>? All right</ss>
<ss>I miscounted</ss>
<ss>Thank you very much</ss>
<ss></ss>
<ss>This is the <ORDINAL> time I'll speak to you from <FAC>, and the last</ss>
<ss>We've been together <DATE> now, and soon it'll be time for me to go</ss>
<ss>But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a <PERSON>ng time</ss>
<ss>It's been the honor of my life to be your President</ss>
<ss>So many of you have written <DATE> to say thanks, but I could say as much to you</ss>
<ss><PERSON> and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve</ss>
<ss>One of the things about the Presidency is that you're always somewhat apart</ss>
<ss>You spent a <PERSON>t of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass -- the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return</ss>
<ss>And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass, and connect</ss>
<ss>Well, maybe I can do a little of that <TIME></ss>
<ss>People ask how I feel about leaving</ss>
<ss>And the fact is, "parting is such sweet sorrow</ss>
<ss>" The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom</ss>
<ss>The sorrow -- the goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place</ss>
<ss>You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of <ORG> where the President and his family live</ss>
<ss>There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and <PERSON>ok out of <TIME></ss>
<ss>The view is over the grounds here to <ORG>, and then the <FAC> and <FAC></ss>
<ss>But on mornings when the humidity is <PERSON>w, you can see past the <PERSON> to the river, the Potomac, and the Virginia shore</ss>
<ss>Someone said that's the view <ORG> had when he saw the smoke rising from <ORG></ss>
<ss>I see more prosaic things: the grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river</ss>
<ss>I've been thinking a bit at that window</ss>
<ss>I've been reflecting on what <DATE> have meant and mean</ss>
<ss>And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one -- a small story about a big ship, and a refugee, and a sai<PERSON>r</ss>
<ss>It was back in <DATE>, at the height of the boat people</ss>
<ss>And the sai<PERSON>r was hard at work on the carrier <PERSON>, which was patrolling <LOC></ss>
<ss>The sai<PERSON>r, like most <NORP> servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant</ss>
<ss>The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat</ss>
<ss>And crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America</ss>
<ss>The <PERSON> sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety</ss>
<ss>As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sai<PERSON>r on deck, and stood up, and called out to him</ss>
<ss>He yelled, "Hel<PERSON>, <NORP> sai<PERSON>r</ss>
<ss>Hel<PERSON>, freedom man</ss>
<ss>" A small moment with a big meaning, a moment the sai<PERSON>r, who wrote it in a letter, couldn't get out of his mind</ss>
<ss>And, when I saw it, neither could <ORG> Because that's what it was to be an <NORP> in <DATE></ss>
<ss>We stood, again, for freedom</ss>
<ss>I know we always have, but in <DATE> the world again -- and in a way, we ourselves -- rediscovered it</ss>
<ss>It's been quite a journey <DATE>, and we held together through some stormy seas</ss>
<ss>And at the end, together, we are reaching our destination</ss>
<ss>The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits, from the recession of <DATE>, to the expansion that began in <DATE> and continues to <DATE>, we've made a difference</ss>
<ss>The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proudest of</ss>
<ss>One is the economic recovery, in which the people of America created -- and filled -- 19 million new jobs</ss>
<ss>The other is the recovery of our morale</ss>
<ss>America is respected again in the world and <PERSON>oked to for leadership</ss>
<ss>Something that happened to me <DATE> reflects some of this</ss>
<ss>It was back in <DATE>, and I was attending my <ORDINAL> big economic summit, which was held <DATE> in Canada</ss>
<ss>The meeting place rotates among the member countries</ss>
<ss>The opening meeting was a formal dinner of the heads of goverment of the seven industrialized nations</ss>
<ss>Now, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened, and it was all <FAC> this and <PERSON> that</ss>
<ss>They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a <ORDINAL>-name basis</ss>
<ss>Well, at one point I sort of leaned in and said, "My name's <PERSON></ss>
<ss>" Well, in that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback -- cut taxes and regulation, started to cut spending</ss>
<ss>And soon the recovery began</ss>
<ss><DATE>, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast</ss>
<ss>At the big opening meeting we all got together, and all of a sudden, just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just sitting there <PERSON>oking at me</ss>
<ss>And then one of them broke the silence</ss>
<ss>"Tell us about the <NORP> miracle," he said</ss>
<ss>Well, back in <DATE>, when I was running for President, it was all so different</ss>
<ss>Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe</ss>
<ss>Our views on foreign affairs would cause war</ss>
<ss>Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse</ss>
<ss>I even remember one highly respected economist saying, back in <DATE>, that "The engines of economic growth have shut down here, and they're likely to stay that way for <DATE> to come</ss>
<ss>" Well, he and the other opinion leaders were wrong</ss>
<ss>The fact is what they call "radical" was really "right</ss>
<ss>" What they called "dangerous" was just "desperately needed</ss>
<ss>" And in all of that time I won a nickname, "<WORK_OF_ART></ss>
<ss>" But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference: it was the content</ss>
<ss>I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full b<PERSON>om from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation -- from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for <DATE></ss>
<ss>They called it the <PERSON> revolution</ss>
<ss>Well, I'll accept that, but for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense</ss>
<ss>Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it</ss>
<ss>So, we cut the people's tax rates, and the people produced more than ever before</ss>
<ss>The economy b<PERSON>omed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger</ss>
<ss>Our economic program brought about the <PERSON>ngest peacetime expansion in our history: real family income up, the poverty rate down, entrepreneurship booming, and an exp<PERSON>sion in research and new techno<PERSON>gy</ss>
<ss>We're exporting more than ever because <NORP> industry because more competitive and at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home</ss>
<ss>Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace, we'd have to become strong again after <DATE> of weakness and confusion</ss>
<ss>So, we rebuilt our defenses, and <EVENT> we toasted the new peacefulness around the g<PERSON>be</ss>
<ss>Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons -- and hope for even more progress is bright -- but the regional conflicts that rack the g<PERSON>be are also beginning to cease</ss>
<ss><LOC> is no <PERSON>nger a war zone</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> are leaving Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>The <NORP> are preparing to pull out of Cambodia, and an <NORP>-mediated accord will soon send 50,000 <NORP> troops home from Angola</ss>
<ss>The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our challenges seem complex</ss>
<ss>It will always be this way</ss>
<ss>But as <PERSON>ng as we remember our <ORDINAL> principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours</ss>
<ss>And something else we learned: Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end</ss>
<ss>We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world</ss>
<ss>Countries across the g<PERSON>be are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideo<PERSON>gies of the past</ss>
<ss>For them, the great rediscovery of <DATE> has been that, <PERSON> and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way of government: Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive</ss>
<ss>When you've got to the point when you can celebrate the anniversaries of your <ORDINAL> birthday you can sit back sometimes, review your life, and see it f<PERSON>wing before you</ss>
<ss>For me there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life</ss>
<ss>I never meant to go into politics</ss>
<ss>It wasn't my intention when I was young</ss>
<ss>But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you</ss>
<ss>I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious</ss>
<ss>Ours was the <ORDINAL> revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government, and with three little words: "We the People</ss>
<ss>" "We the People" tell the government what to do; it doesn't tell us</ss>
<ss>"We the People" are the driver; the government is the car</ss>
<ss>And we decide where it should go, and by what route, and how fast</ss>
<ss>Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are</ss>
<ss>Our Constitution is a document in which "We the People" tell the government what it is al<PERSON>wed to do</ss>
<ss>"We the People" are free</ss>
<ss>This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do <DATE></ss>
<ss>But back in <DATE>, when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things -- that through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the government was taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our freedom</ss>
<ss>I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say, "Stop</ss>
<ss>" I was a citizen politician, and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do</ss>
<ss>I think we have stopped a <PERSON>t of what needed stopping</ss>
<ss>And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited</ss>
<ss>There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics: As government expands, liberty contracts</ss>
<ss>Nothing is less free than pure Communism -- and yet we have, <DATE>, forged a satisfying new c<PERSON>seness with the <NORP> Union</ss>
<ss>I've been asked if this isn't a gamble, and my answer is no because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds</ss>
<ss>The detente of <DATE> was based not on actions but promises</ss>
<ss>They'd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world better</ss>
<ss>But the gulag was still the gulag, and the state was still expansionist, and they still waged proxy wars in <LOC>, <LOC>, and <LOC></ss>
<ss>Well, this time, so far, it's different</ss>
<ss>President <PERSON> has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan</ss>
<ss>He has also freed prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met</ss>
<ss>But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents</ss>
<ss>Once, during the heady days of the Moscow summit, <PERSON> and I decided to break off from the entourage <TIME> to visit the shops on <FAC> -- that's a little street just off Moscow's main shopping area</ss>
<ss>Even though our visit was a surprise, every <NORP> there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands</ss>
<ss>We were just about swept away by the warmth</ss>
<ss>You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy</ss>
<ss>But within <TIME>, a <ORG> detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd</ss>
<ss>It was an interesting moment</ss>
<ss>It reminded me that while the man on the street in the <NORP> Union yearns for peace, the government is <NORP></ss>
<ss>And those who run it are <NORP>, and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differently</ss>
<ss>We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust</ss>
<ss>My view is that President <PERSON> is different from previous <NORP> leaders</ss>
<ss>I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them</ss>
<ss>We wish him well</ss>
<ss>And we'll continue to work to make sure that the <NORP> Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one</ss>
<ss>What it all boils down to is this: I want the new c<PERSON>seness to continue</ss>
<ss>And it will, as <PERSON>ng as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as <PERSON>ng as they continue to act in a helpful manner</ss>
<ss>If and when they don't, at <ORDINAL> pull your punches</ss>
<ss>If they persist, pull the plug</ss>
<ss>It's still trust but verify</ss>
<ss>It's still play, but cut the cards</ss>
<ss>It's still watch c<PERSON>sely</ss>
<ss>And don't be afraid to see what you see</ss>
<ss>I've been asked if I have any regrets</ss>
<ss>Well, I do</ss>
<ss>The deficit is one</ss>
<ss>I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but <TIME> isn't for arguments, and I'm going to hold my tongue</ss>
<ss>But an observation: I've had my share of victories in the <ORG>, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me</ss>
<ss>They never saw my troops, they never saw <PERSON>'s regiments, the <NORP> people</ss>
<ss>You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action</ss>
<ss>Well, action is still needed</ss>
<ss>If we're to finish the job</ss>
<ss><PERSON>'s regiments will have to become the <PERSON> brigades</ss>
<ss>Soon he'll be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did</ss>
<ss>Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in Presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time</ss>
<ss>But oddly enough it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of in <DATE>: the resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism</ss>
<ss>This national feeling is good, but it won't count for much, and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge</ss>
<ss>An informed patriotism is what we want</ss>
<ss>And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the <PERSON>ng history of the world? Those of us who are over <DATE> grew up in a different America</ss>
<ss>We were taught, very directly, what it means to be an <NORP></ss>
<ss>And we absorbed, almost in the air, a <PERSON>ve of country and an appreciation of its institutions</ss>
<ss>If you didn't get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who <PERSON>st someone at <PERSON></ss>
<ss>Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school</ss>
<ss>And if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture</ss>
<ss>The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special</ss>
<ss>TV was like that, too, through <DATE></ss>
<ss>But now, we're about to enter <DATE>, and some things have changed</ss>
<ss>Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children</ss>
<ss>And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no <PERSON>nger the style</ss>
<ss>Our spirit is back, but we haven't reinstitutionalized it</ss>
<ss>We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom -- freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise</ss>
<ss>And freedom is special and rare</ss>
<ss>It's fragile; it needs production</ss>
<ss>So, we've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion but what's important -- why the <NORP> came here, who <PERSON> was, and what those <TIME> over Tokyo meant</ss>
<ss>You know, <DATE> on the <ORDINAL> anniversary of <DATE>, I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father, who'd fought on Omaha Beach</ss>
<ss>Her name was <PERSON>, and she said, "we will always remember, we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did</ss>
<ss>" Well, let's help her keep her word</ss>
<ss>If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are</ss>
<ss>I'm warning of an eradication of the <NORP> memory that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the <NORP> spirit</ss>
<ss>Let's start with some basics: more attention to <NORP> history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual</ss>
<ss>And let me offer lesson number one about America: All great change in America begins at the dinner table</ss>
<ss>So, <TIME> in the kitchen I hope the talking begins</ss>
<ss>And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an <NORP>, let 'em know and nail 'em on it</ss>
<ss>That would be a very <NORP> thing to do</ss>
<ss>And that's about all I have to say <TIME>, except for one thing</ss>
<ss><DATE> when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the "shining city upon a hill</ss>
<ss>" The phrase comes from <PERSON>, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined</ss>
<ss>What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom man</ss>
<ss>He journeyed here on what <DATE> we'd call a little wooden boat; and like the other <NORP>, he was <PERSON>oking for a home that would be free</ss>
<ss>I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it</ss>
<ss>But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, <PERSON>-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity</ss>
<ss>And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here</ss>
<ss>That's how I saw it, and see it still</ss>
<ss>And how stands the city on <TIME>? More prosperous, more secure, and happier than it was <DATE></ss>
<ss>But more than that: After <DATE>, <DATE>, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her g<PERSON>w has held steady no matter what storm</ss>
<ss>And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the <PERSON>st places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home</ss>
<ss>We've done our part</ss>
<ss>And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the <PERSON> revolution, the men and women across America who for <DATE> did the work that brought America back</ss>
<ss>My friends: We did it</ss>
<ss>We weren't just marking time</ss>
<ss>We made a difference</ss>
<ss>We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands</ss>
<ss>All in all, not bad, not bad at all</ss>
<ss>And so, goodbye, <PERSON> bless you, and <PERSON> bless the United States of America</ss>
<ss></ss>
