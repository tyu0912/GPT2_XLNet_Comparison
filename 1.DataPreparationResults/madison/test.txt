To the House of Representatives of the United States Having considered the bill this day presented to me entitled An act to set apart and pledge certain funds for internal improvements , and which sets apart and pledges funds for constructing roads and canals , and improving the navigation of water courses , in order to facilitate , promote , and give security to internal commerce among the several States , and to render more easy and less expensive the means and provisions for the common defense , I am constrained by the insuperable difficulty I feel in reconciling the bill with the Constitution of the United States to return it with that objection to the House of Representatives , in which it originated . The legislative powers vested in Congress are specified and enumerated in the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution , and it does not appear that the power proposed to be exercised by the bill is among the enumerated powers , or that it falls by any just interpretation within the power to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution those or other powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States . The power to regulate commerce among the several States can not include a power to construct roads and canals , and to improve the navigation of water courses in order to facilitate , promote , and secure such a commerce without a latitude of construction departing from the ordinary import of the terms strengthened by the known inconveniences which doubtless led to the grant of this remedial power to Congress . To refer the power in question to the clause to provide for the common defense and general welfare would be contrary to the established and consistent rules of interpretation , as rendering the special and careful enumeration of powers which follow the clause nugatory and improper . Such a view of the Constitution would have the effect of giving to Congress a general power of legislation instead of the defined and limited one hitherto understood to belong to them , the terms common defense and general welfare embracing every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust . It would have the effect of subjecting both the Constitution and laws of the several States in all cases not specifically exempted to be superseded by laws of Congress , it being expressly declared that the Constitution of the United States and laws made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land , and the judges of every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . Such a view of the Constitution , finally , would have the effect of excluding the judicial authority of the United States from its participation in guarding the boundary between the legislative powers of the General and the State Governments , inasmuch as questions relating to the general welfare , being questions of policy and expediency , are unsusceptible of judicial cognizance and decision . A restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to cases which are to be provided for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of Congress all the great and most important measures of Government , money being the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into execution . If a general power to construct roads and canals , and to improve the navigation of water courses , with the train of powers incident thereto , be not possessed by Congress , the assent of the States in the mode provided in the bill can not confer the power . The only cases in which the consent and cession of particular States can extend the power of Congress are those specified and provided for in the Constitution . I am not unaware of the great importance of roads and canals and the improved navigation of water courses , and that a power in the National Legislature to provide for them might be exercised with signal advantage to the general prosperity . But seeing that such a power is not expressly given by the Constitution , and believing that it can not be deduced from any part of it without an inadmissible latitude of construction and a reliance on insufficient precedents believing also that the permanent success of the Constitution depends on a definite partition of powers between the General and the State Governments , and that no adequate landmarks would be left by the constructive extension of the powers of Congress as proposed in the bill , I have no option but to withhold my signature from it , and to cherishing the hope that its beneficial objects may be attained by a resort for the necessary powers to the same wisdom and virtue in the nation which established the Constitution in its actual form and providently marked out in the instrument itself a safe and practicable mode of improving it as experience might suggest . JAMES MADISON .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States Having bestowed on the bill entitled An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States of America that full consideration which is due to the great importance of the subject , and dictated by the respect which I feel for the two Houses of Congress , I am constrained by a deep and solemn conviction that the bill ought not to become a law to return it to the Senate , in which it originated , with my objections to the same . Waiving the question of the constitutional authority of the Legislature to establish an incorporated bank as being precluded in my judgment by repeated recognitions under varied circumstances of the validity of such an institution in acts of the legislative , executive , and judicial branches of the Government , accompanied by indications , in different modes , of a concurrence of the general will of the nation , the proposed bank does not appear to be calculated to answer the purposes of reviving the public credit , of providing a national medium of circulation , and of aiding the Treasury by facilitating the indispensable anticipations of the revenue and by affording to the public more durable loans . 1 . The capital of the bank is to be compounded of specie , of public stocks , and of Treasury notes convertible into stock , with a certain pro portion of each of which every subscriber is to furnish himself . The amount of the stock to be subscribed will not , it is believed , be sufficient to produce in favor of the public credit any considerable or lasting elevation of the market price , whilst this may be occasionally depressed by the bank itself if it should carry into the market the allowed proportion of its capital consisting of public stock in order to procure specie , which it may find its account in procuring with some sacrifice on that part of its capital . Nor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the subscription of Treasury notes . The actual issue of these notes nearly equals at present , and will soon exceed , the amount to be subscribed to the bank . The direct effect of this operation is simply to convert fifteen millions of Treasury notes into fifteen millions of 6 per cent stock , with the collateral effect of promoting an additional demand for Treasury notes beyond what might otherwise be negotiable . Public credit might indeed be expected to derive advantage from the establishment of a national bank , without regard to the formation of its capital , if the full aid and cooperation of the institution were secured to the Government during the war and during the period of its fiscal embarrassments . But the bank proposed will be free from all legal obligation to cooperate with the public measures , and whatever might be the patriotic disposition of its directors to contribute to the removal of those embarrassments , and to invigorate the prosecution of the war , fidelity to the pecuniary and general interest of the institution according to their estimate of it might oblige them to decline a connection of their operations with those of the National Treasury during the continuance of the war and the difficulties incident to it . Temporary sacrifices of interest , though overbalanced by the future and permanent profits of the charter , not being requirable of right in behalf of the public , might not be gratuitously made , and the bank would reap the full benefit of the grant , whilst the public would lose the equivalent expected from it for it must be kept in view that the sole inducement to such a grant on the part of the public would be the prospect of substantial aids to its pecuniary means at the present crisis and during the sequel of the war . It is evident that the stock of the bank will on the return of peace , if not sooner , rise in the market to a value which , if the bank were established in a period of peace , would authorize and obtain for the public a bonus to a very large amount . In lieu of such a bonus the Government is fairly entitled to and ought not to relinquish or risk the needful services of the bank under the pressing circumstances of war . 2 . The bank as proposed to be constituted can not be relied on during the war to provide a circulating medium nor to furnish loans or antici pations of the public revenue . Without a medium the taxes can not be collected , and in the absence of specie the medium understood to be the best substitute is that of notes issued by a national bank . The proposed bank will commence and conduct its operations under an obligation to pay its notes in specie , or be subject to the loss of its charter . Without such an obligation the notes of the bank , though not exchangeable for specie , yet resting on good pledges and performing the uses of specie in the payment of taxes and in other public transactions , would , as experience has ascertained , qualify the bank to supply at once a circulating medium and pecuniary aids to the Government . Under the fetters imposed by the bill it is manifest that during the actual state of things , and probably during the war , the period particularly requiring such a medium and such a resource for loans and advances to the Government , notes for which the bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange could not be kept in circulation . The most the bank could effect , and the most it could be expected to aim at , would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local transactions which , with the interest on the public stock in the bank , might yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose until a change from war to peace should enable it , by a flow of specie into its vaults and a removal of the external demand for it , to derive its contemplated emoluments from a safe and full extension of its operations . On the whole , when it is considered that the proposed establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a national bank for a period of twenty years that the monopolized profits will be continually growing with the progress of the national population and wealth that the nation will during the same period be dependent on the notes of the bank for that species of circulating medium whenever the precious metals may be wanted , and at all times for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium , and that the extensive employment of the notes in the collection of the augmented taxes will , moreover , enable the bank greatly to extend its profitable issues of them without the expense of specie capital to support their circulation , it is as reasonable as it is requisite that the Government , in return for these extraordinary concessions to the bank , should have a greater security for attaining the public objects of the institution than is presented in the bill , and particularly for every practicable accommodation , both in the temporary advances necessary to anticipate the taxes and in those more durable loans which are equally necessary to diminish the resort to taxes . In discharging this painful duty of stating objections to a measure which has undergone the deliberations and received the sanction of the two Houses of the National Legislature I console myself with the reflection that if they have not the weight which I attach to them they can be constitutionally overruled , and with a confidence that in a contrary event the wisdom of Congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigencies . JAMES MADISON .<speech_sep>Having examined and considered the Bill , entitled An Act incorporating the protestant Episcopal Church in the Town of Alexandria in the District of Columbia , I now return the Bill to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , with the following objections . Because the Bill exceeds the rightful authority , to which Governments are limited by the essential distinction between Civil and Religious functions , and violates , in particular , the Article of the Constitution of the United States which declares , that Congress shall make no law respecting a Religious establishment . The Bill enacts into , and establishes by law , sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to the organization and polity of the Church incorporated , and comprehending even the election and removal of the Minister of the same , so that no change could be made therein , by the particular Society , or by the General Church of which it is a member , and whose authority it recognizes . This particular Church , therefore , would so far be a religious establishment by law , a legal force and sanction being given to certain articles in its constitution and administration . Nor can it be considered that the articles thus established , are to be taken as the descriptive criteria only , of the corporate identity of the Society , in as much as this identity , must depend on other characteristics , as the regulations established are generally unessential and alterable , according to the principles and cannons , by which Churches of that denomination govern themselves , and as the injunctions prohibitions contained in the regulations would be enforced by the penal consequences applicable to a violation of them according to the local law . Because the Bill vests in the said incorporated Church , an authority to provide for the support of the poor , and the education of poor children of the same , an authority , which being altogether superfluous if the provision is to be the result of pious charity , would be a precident for giving to religious Societies as such , a legal agency in carrying into effect a public and civil duty .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives In calling you together sooner than a separation from your homes would otherwise have been required I yielded to considerations drawn from the posture of our foreign affairs , and in fixing the present for the time of your meeting regard was had to the probability of further developments of the policy of the belligerent powers toward this country which might the more unite the national councils in the measures to be pursued . At the close of the last session of Congress it was hoped that the successive confirmations of the extinction of the French decrees , so far as they violated our neutral commerce , would have induced the Government of Great Britain to repeal its orders in council , and thereby authorize a removal of the existing obstructions to her commerce with the United States . Instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the two nations , the orders were , at a moment when least to have been expected , put into more rigorous execution and it was communicated through the British envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the edicts of France , as officially made known to the British Government , was denied to have taken place , it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the British orders that commerce should restored to a footing that would admit the productions and manufactures of Great Britain , when owned by neutrals , into markets shut against them by her enemy , the United States being given to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their nonimportation act would lead to measures of retaliation . At a later date it has indeed appeared that a communication to the British Government of fresh evidence of the repeal of the French decrees against our neutral trade was followed by an intimation that it had been transmitted to the British plenipotentiary here in order that it might receive full consideration in the depending discussions . This communication appears not to have been received but the transmission of it hither , instead of founding on it an actual repeal of the orders or assurances that the repeal would ensue , will not permit us to rely on any effective change in the British cabinet . To be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory proofs of such a change , and to proceed in the mean time in adapting our measures to the views which have been disclosed through that minister will best consult our whole duty . In the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures indemnity and redress for other wrongs have continued to be withheld , and our coasts and the mouths of our harbors have again witnessed scenes not less derogatory to the dearest of our national rights than vexation to the regular course of our trade . Among the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships of war hovering on our coasts was an encounter between 1 of them and the American frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers , rendered unavoidable on the part of the latter by a fire commenced without cause by the former , whose commander is therefore alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining the honor of the American flag . The proceedings of a court of inquiry requested by Captain Rodgers are communicated , together with the correspondence relating to the occurrence , between the Secretary of State and His Britannic Majesty s envoy . To these are added the several correspondences which have passed on the subject of the British orders in council , and to both the correspondence relating to the Floridas , in which Congress will be made acquainted with the interposition which the Government of Great Britain has thought proper to make against the proceeding of the United States . The justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the United States toward France , both before and since the revocation of her decrees , authorized an expectation that her Government would have followed up that measure by all such others as were due to our reasonable claims , as well s dictated by its amicable professions . No proof , however , is yet given of an intention to repair the other wrongs done to the United States , and particularly to restore the great amount of American property seized and condemned under edicts which , though not affecting our neutral relations , and therefore not entering into questions between the United States and other belligerents , were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles that the reparation ought to have been prompt and ample . In addition to this and other demands of strict right on that nation , the United States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and unexpected restrictions to which their trade with the French dominions has been subjected , and which , if not discontinued , will require at least corresponding restrictions on importations from France into the United States . On all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary lately sent to Paris has carried with him the necessary instructions , the result of which will be communicated to you , by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the French Government toward the United States , will enable you to adapt to it that of the United States toward France . Our other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes . With Russia they are on the best footing of friendship . The ports of Sweden have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions toward our commerce in the councils of that nation also , and the information from our special minister to Denmark shews that the mission had been attended with valuable effects to our citizens , whose property had been so extensively violated and endangered by cruisers under the Danish flag . Under the ominous indications which commanded attention it became a duty to exert the means committed to the executive department in providing for the general security . The works of defense on our maritime frontier have accordingly been prosecuted with an activity leaving little to be added for the completion of the most important ones , and , as particularly suited for cooperation in emergencies , a portion of the gun boats have in particular harbors been ordered into use . The ships of war before in commission , with the addition of a frigate , have been chiefly employed as a cruising guard to the rights of our coast , and such a disposition has been made of our land forces as was thought to promise the services most appropriate and important . In this disposition is included a force consisting of regulars and militia , embodied in the Indiana Territory and marched toward our northwestern frontier . This measure was made requisite by several murders and depredations committed by Indians , but more especially by the menacing preparations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash , under the influence and direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe . With these exceptions the Indian tribes retain their peaceable dispositions toward us , and their usual pursuits . I must now add that the period is arrived which claims from the legislative guardians of the national rights a system of more ample provisions for maintaining them . Notwithstanding the scrupulous justice , the protracted moderation , and the multiplied efforts on the part of the United States to substitute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the 2 countries all the mutual advantages of reestablished friendship and confidence , we have seen that the British cabinet perseveres not only in withholding a remedy for other wrongs , so long and so loudly calling for it , but in the execution , brought home to the threshold of our territory , of measures which under existing circumstances have the character as well as the effect of war on our lawful commerce . With this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which no independent nation can relinquish , Congress will feel the duty of putting the United States into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis , and corresponding with the national spirit and expectations . I recommend , accordingly , that adequate provisions be made for filling the ranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops for an auxiliary force to be engaged for a more limited term for the acceptance of volunteer corps , whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in urgent services for detachments as they may be wanted of other portions of the militia , and for such a preparation of the great body as will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacities . Nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the importance of those military seminaries which in every event will form a valuable and frugal part of our military establishment . The manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success , and the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions are adequate to emergencies . It will not be inexpedient , however , for Congress to authorize an enlargement of them . Your attention will of course be drawn to such provisions on the subject of our naval force as may be required for the services to which it may be best adapted . I submit to Congress the seasonableness also of an authority to augment the stock of such materials as are imperishable in their nature , or may not at once be attainable . In contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous epoch , and estimating their claims to our attention , it is impossible to overlook those developing themselves among the great communities which occupy the southern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood . An enlarged philanthropy and an enlightened forecast concur in imposing on the national councils an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies , to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will , to regard the progress of events , and not to be unprepared for whatever order of things may be ultimately established . Under another aspect of our situation the early attention of Congress will be due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and infractions of our commercial laws . The practice of smuggling , which is odious everywhere , and particularly criminal in free governments , where , the laws being made by all for the good of all , a fraud is committed on every individual as well as on the state , attains its utmost guilt when it blends with a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency , in the transgressors , to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country . It is them that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enabled to manifest itself through the regular animadversions of the most competent laws . To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag , and to the honest interests which it covers , it is expedient also that it be made punishable in our citizens to accepts licenses from foreign governments for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other American citizens , or to trade under false colors or papers of any sort . A prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance by our citizens of special licenses to be used in a trade with the United States , and against the admission into particular ports of the United States of vessels from foreign countries authorized to trade with particular ports only . Although other subjects will press more immediately on your deliberations , a portion of them can not but be well bestowed on the just and sound policy of securing to our manufactures the success they have attained , and are still attaining , in some degree , under the impulse of causes not permanent , and to our navigation , the fair extent of which is at present abridged by the unequal regulations of foreign governments . Besides the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sacrifices which a change of circumstances might bring on them , the national interest requires that , WRT such articles at least as belong to our defense and our primary wants , we should not be left in unnecessary dependence on external supplies . And whilst foreign governments adhere to the existing discriminations in their ports against our navigation , and an equality or lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their navigation in our ports , the effect can not be mistaken , because it has been seriously felt by our shipping interests and in proportion as this takes place the advantages of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign markets and of a growing body of mariners trained by their occupations for the service of their country in times of danger must be diminished . The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of September last have exceeded 13 . 5and have enabled us to defray the current expenses , including the interest on the public debt , and to reimburse more than 5M of the principal without recurring to the loan authorized by the act of the last session . The temporary loan obtained in the latter end of the year 1810 has also been reimbursed , and is not included in that amount . The decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce , and the extraordinary expenses which have and may become necessary , must be taken into view in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year and I recommend to your consideration the propriety of insuring a sufficiency of annual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expenses of Government , and to pay the interest on the public debt , including that on new loans which may be authorized . I can not close this communication without expressing my deep sense of the crisis in which you are assembled , my confidence in a wise and honorable result to your deliberations , and assurances of the faithful zeal with which my cooperating duties will be discharged , invoking at the same time the blessing of Heaven on our beloved country and on all the means that may be employed in vindicating its rights and advancing its welfare .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives At the period of our last meeting I had the satisfaction of communicating an adjustment with one of the principal belligerent nations , highly important in itself , and still more so as presaging a more extended accommodation . It is with deep concern I am now to inform you that the favorable prospect has been over clouded by a refusal of the British Government to abide by the act of its minister plenipotentiary , and by its ensuing policy toward the United States as seen through the communications of the minister sent to replace him . Whatever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements formed by diplomatic functionaries in cases where by the terms of the engagements a mutual ratification is reserved , or where notice at the time may have been given of a departure from instructions , or in extraordinary cases essentially violating the principles of equity , a disavowal could not have been apprehended in a case where no such notice or violation existed , where no such ratification was reserved , and more especially where , as is now in proof , an engagement to be executed without any such ratification was contemplated by the instructions given , and where it had with good faith been carried into immediate execution on the part of the United States . These considerations not having restrained the British Government from disavowing the arrangement by virtue of which its orders in council were to be revoked , and the event authorizing the renewal of commercial intercourse having thus not taken place , it necessarily became a question of equal urgency and importance whether the act prohibiting that intercourse was not to be considered as remaining in legal force . This question being , after due deliberation , determined in the affirmative , a proclamation to that effect was issued . It could not but happen , however , that a return to this state of things from that which had followed an execution of the arrangement by the United States would involve difficulties . With a view to diminish these as much as possible , the instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury now laid before you were transmitted to the collectors of the several ports . If in permitting British vessels to depart without giving bonds not to proceed to their own ports it should appear that the tenor of legal authority has not been strictly pursued , it is to be ascribed to the anxious desire which was felt that no individuals should be injured by so unforeseen an occurrence and I rely on the regard of Congress for the equitable interests of our own citizens to adopt whatever further provisions may be found requisite for a general remission of penalties involuntarily incurred . The recall of the disavowed minister having been followed by the appointment of a successor , hopes were indulged that the new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment which had been produced , and to remove the causes which had so long embarrassed the good understanding of the two nations . It could not be doubted that it would at least be charged with conciliatory explanations of the step which had been taken and with proposals to be substituted for the rejected arrangement . Reasonable and universal as this expectation was , it also has not been fulfilled . From the first official disclosures of the new minister it was found that he had received no authority to enter into explanations relative to either branch of the arrangement disavowed nor any authority to substitute proposals as to that branch which concerned the British orders in council , and , finally , that his proposals WRT the other branch , the attack on the frigate Chesapeake , were founded on a presumption repeatedly declared to be inadmissible by the United States , that the first step toward adjustment was due from them , the proposals at the same time omitting even a reference to the officer answerable for the murderous aggression , and asserting a claim not less contrary to the British laws and British practice than to the principles and obligations of the United States . The correspondence between the Department of State and this minister will show how unessentially the features presented in its commencement have been varied in its progress . It will sow also that , forgetting the respect due to all governments , he did not refrain from imputations on this , which required that no further communications should be received from him . The necessity of this step will be made known to His Britannic Majesty through the minister plenipotentiary of the United States in London and it would indicate a want of the confidence due to a Government which so well understands and exacts what becomes foreign ministers near it not to infer that the misconduct of its own representative will be viewed in the same light in which it has been regarded here . The British Government will learn at the same time that a ready attention will be given to communications through any channel which may be substituted . It will be happy if the change in this respect should be accompanied by a favorable revision of the unfriendly policy which has been so long pursued toward the United States . With France , the other belligerent , whose trespasses on our commercial rights have long been the subject of our just remonstrances , the posture of our relations does not correspond with the measures taken on the part of the United States to effect a favorable change . The result of the several communications made to her Government , in pursuance of the authorities vested by Congress in the Executive , is contained in the correspondence of our minister at Paris now laid before you . By some of the other belligerents , although professing just and amicable dispositions , injuries materially affecting our commerce have not been duly controlled or repressed . In these cases the interpositions deemed proper on our part have not been omitted . But it well deserves the consideration of the Legislature how far both the safety and the honor of the American flag may be consulted , by adequate provisions against that collusive prostitution of it by individuals unworthy of the American name which has so much flavored the real or pretended suspicions under which the honest commerce of their fellow citizens has suffered . In relation to the powers on the coast of Barbary , nothing has occurred which is not of a nature rather to inspire confidence than distrust as to the continuance of the existing amity . With our Indian neighbors , the just and benevolent system continued toward them has also preserved peace , and is more and more advancing habits favorable to their civilization and happiness . From a statement which will be made by the Secretary of War it will be seen that the fortifications on our maritime frontier are in many of the ports completed , affording the defense which was contemplated , and that a further time will be required to render complete the works in the harbor of New York and in some other places . By the enlargement of the works and the employment of a greater number of hands at the public armories the supply of small arms of an improving quality appears to be annually increasing at a rate that , with those made on private contract , may be expected to go far toward providing for the public exigency . The act of Congress providing for the equipment of our vessels of war having been fully carried into execution , I refer to the statement of the Secretary of the Navy for the information which may be proper on that subject . To that statement is added a view of the transfers of appropriations authorized by the act of the session preceding the last and of the grounds on which the transfers were made . Whatever may be the course of your deliberations on the subject of our military establishments , I should fail in my duty in not recommending to your serious attention the importance of giving to our militia , the great bulwark of our security and resource of our power , an organization best adapted to eventual situations for which the United States ought to be prepared . The sums which had been previously accumulated in the Treasury , together with the receipts during the year ending on the 30th of September last and amounting to more than 9M , have enabled us to fulfill all our engagements and to defray the current expenses of Government without recurring to any loan . But the insecurity of our commerce and the consequent diminution of the public revenue will probably produce a deficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year , for which and for other details I refer to the statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury . In the state which has been presented of our affairs with the great parties to a disastrous and protracted war , carried on in a mode equally injurious and unjust to the United States as a neutral nation , the wisdom of the National Legislature will be again summoned to the important decision on the alternatives before them . That these will be met in a spirit worthy the councils of a nation conscious both of its rectitude and of its rights , and careful as well of its honor as of its peace , I have an entire confidence and that the result will be stamped by a unanimity becoming the occasion , and be supported by every portion of our citizens with a patriotism enlightened and invigorated by experience , ought as little to be doubted . In the midst of the wrongs and vexations experienced from external causes there is much room for congratulation on the prosperity and happiness flowing from our situation at home . The blessing of health has never been more universal . The fruits of the seasons , though in particular articles and districts short of their usual redundancy , are more than sufficient for our wants and our comforts . The face of our country every presents evidence of laudable enterprise , of extensive capital , and of durable improvement . In a cultivation of the materials and the extension of useful manufactures , more especially in the general application to household fabrics , we behold a rapid diminution of our dependence on foreign supplies . Nor is it unworthy of reflection that this revolution in our pursuits and habits is in no slight degree a consequence of those impolitic and arbitrary edicts by which the contending nations , in endeavoring each of them to obstruct our trade with the other , have so far abridged our means of procuring the productions and manufactures of which our own are now taking the place . Recollecting always that for every advantage which may contribute to distinguish our lot from that to which others are doomed by the unhappy spirit of the times we are indebted to that Divine Providence whose goodness has been so remarkably extended to this rising nation , it becomes us to cherish a devout gratitude , and to implore from the same omnipotent source a blessing on the consultations and measures about to be undertaken for the welfare of our beloved country .<speech_sep>Whereas the territory south of the Mississippi Territory and eastward of the river Mississippi , and extending to the river Perdido , of which possession was not delivered to the United States in pursuance of the treaty concluded at Paris on the 30th April , 1803 , has at all times , as is well known , been considered and claimed by them as being within the colony of Louisiana conveyed by the said treaty in the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain and that it had when France originally possessed it andWhereas the acquiescence of the United States in the temporary continuance of the said territory under the Spanish authority was not the result of any distrust of their title , as has been particularly evinced by the general tenor of their laws and by the distinction made in the application of those laws between that territory and foreign countries , but was occasioned by their conciliatory views and by a confidence in the justice of their cause and in the success of candid discussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly power andWhereas a satisfactory adjustment , too long delayed , without the fault of the United States , has for some time been entirely suspended by events over which they had no control andWhereas a crisis has at length arrived subversive of the order of things under the Spanish authorities , whereby a failure of the United States to take the said territory into its possession may lead to events ultimately contravening the views of both parties , whilst in the meantime the tranquillity and security of our adjoining territories are endangered and new facilities given to violations of our revenue and commercial laws and of those prohibiting the introduction of slaves Considering , moreover , that under these peculiar and imperative circumstances a forbearance on the part of the United States to occupy the territory in question , and thereby guard against the confusions and contingencies which threaten it , might be construed into a dereliction of their title or an insensibility to the importance of the stake considering that in the hands of the United States it will not cease to be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment considering , finally , that the acts of Congress , though contemplating a present possession by a foreign authority , have contemplated also an eventual possession of the said territory by the United States , and are accordingly so framed as in that case to extend in their operation to the same Now be it known that James Madison , President of the United States of America , in pursuance of these weighty and urgent considerations , have deemed it right and requisite that possession should be taken of the said territory in the name and behalf of the United States . William Claiborne , governor of the Orleans Territory , of which the said Territory is to be taken as part , will accordingly proceed to execute the same and to exercise over the said Territory the authorities and functions legally appertaining to his office and the good people inhabiting the same are invited and enjoined to pay due respect to him in that character , to be obedient to the laws , to maintain order , to cherish harmony , and in every manner to conduct themselves as peaceable citizens , under full assurance that they will be protected in the enjoyment of their liberty , property , and religion . In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed , and signed the same with my hand . Done at the city of Washington , the 27th day of October , 1810 , and in the thirty fifth year of the Independence of the said United States . JAMES MADISOBy the President SMITH , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives On our present meeting it is my first duty to invite your attention to the providential favors which our country has experienced in the unusual degree of health dispensed to its inhabitants , and in the rich abundance with which the earth has rewarded the labors bestowed on it . In the successful cultivation of other branches of industry , and in the progress of general improvement favorable to the national prosperity , there is just occasion also for our mutual congratulations and thankfulness . With these blessings are necessarily mingled the pressures and vicissitudes incident to the state of war into which the United States have been forced by the perseverance of a foreign power in its system of injustice and aggression . Previous to its declaration it was deemed proper , as a measure of precaution and forecast , that a considerable force should be placed in the Michigan Territory with a general view to its security , and , in the event of war , to such operations in the uppermost Canada as would intercept the hostile influence of Great Britain over the savages , obtain the command of the lake on which that part of Canada borders , and maintain cooperating relations with such forces as might be most conveniently employed against other parts . Brigadier General Hull was charged with this provisional service , having under his command a body of troops composed of regulars and of volunteers from the State of Ohio . Having reached his destination after his knowledge of the war , and possessing discretionary authority to act offensively , he passed into the neighboring territory of the enemy with a prospect of easy and victorious progress . The expedition , nevertheless , terminated unfortunately , not only in a retreat to the town and fort of Detroit , but in the surrender of both and of the gallant corps commanded by that officer . The causes of this painful reverse will be investigated by a military tribunal . A distinguishing feature in the operations which preceded and followed this adverse event is the use made by the enemy of the merciless savages under their influence . Whilst the benevolent policy of the United States invariably recommended peace and promoted civilization among that wretched portion of the human race , and was making exertions to dissuade them from taking either side in the war , the enemy has not scrupled to call to his aid their ruthless ferocity , armed with the horrors of those instruments of carnage and torture which are known to spare neither age nor sex . In this outrage against the laws of honorable war and against the feelings sacred to humanity the British commanders can not resort to a plea of retaliation , for it is committed in the face of our example . They can not mitigate it by calling it a self defense against men in arms , for it embraces the most shocking butcheries of defenseless families . Nor can it be pretended that they are not answerable for the atrocities perpetrated , since the savages are employed with a knowledge , and even with menaces , that their fury could not be controlled . Such is the spectacle which the deputed authorities of a nation boasting its religion and morality have not been restrained from presenting to an enlightened age . The misfortune at Detroit was not , however , without a consoling effect . It was followed by signal proofs that the national spirit rises according to the pressure on it . The loss of an important post and of the brave men surrendered with it inspired everywhere new ardor and determination . In the States and districts least remote it was no sooner known than every citizen was ready to fly with his arms at once to protect his brethren against the blood thirsty savages let loose by the enemy on an extensive frontier , and to convert a partial calamity into a source of invigorated efforts . This patriotic zeal , which it was necessary rather to limit than excite , has embodied an ample force from the States of Kentucky and Ohio and from parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia . It is placed , with the addition of a few regulars , under the command of Brigadier General Harrison , who possesses the entire confidence of his fellow soldiers , among whom are citizens , some of them volunteers in the ranks , not less distinguished by their political stations than by their personal merits . The greater portion of this force is proceeding in relieving an important frontier post , and in several incidental operations against hostile tribes of savages , rendered indispensable by the subserviency into which they had been seduced by the enemy a seduction the more cruel as it could not fail to impose a necessity of precautionary severities against those who yielded to it . At a recent date an attack was made on a post of the enemy near Niagara by a detachment of the regular and other forces under the command of Major General Van Rensselaer , of the militia of the State of New York . The attack , it appears , was ordered in compliance with the ardor of the troops , who executed it with distinguished gallantry , and were for a time victorious but not receiving the expected support , they were compelled to yield to reenforcements of British regulars and savages . Our loss has been considerable , and is deeply to be lamented . That of the enemy , less ascertained , will be the more felt , as it includes among the killed the commanding general , who was also the governor of the Province , and was sustained by veteran troops from unexperienced soldiers , who must daily improve in the duties of the field . Our expectation of gaining the command of the Lakes by the invasion of Canada from Detroit having been disappointed , measures were instantly taken to provide on them a naval force superior to that of the enemy . From the talents and activity of the officer charged with this object everything that can be done may be expected . Should the present season not admit of complete success , the progress made will insure for the next a naval ascendancy where it is essential to our permanent peace with and control over the savages . Among the incidents to the measures of the war I am constrained to advert to the refusal of the governors of Maine and Connecticut to furnish the required detachments of militia toward the defense of the maritime frontier . The refusal was founded on a novel and unfortunate exposition of the provisions of the Constitution relating to the militia . The correspondences which will be laid before you contain the requisite information on the subject . It is obvious that if the authority of the United States to call into service and command the militia for the public defense can be thus frustrated , even in a state of declared war and of course under apprehensions of invasion preceding war , they are not one nation for the purpose most of all requiring it , and that the public safety may have no other resource than in those large and permanent military establishments which are forbidden by the principles of our free government , and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark . On the coasts and on the ocean the war has been as successful as circumstances inseparable from its early stages could promise . Our public ships and private cruisers , by their activity , and , where there was occasion , by their intrepidity , have made the enemy sensible of the difference between a reciprocity of captures and the long confinement of them to their side . Our trade , with little exception , has safely reached our ports , having been much favored in it by the course pursued by a squadron of our frigates under the command of Commodore Rodgers , and in the instance in which skill and bravery were more particularly tried with those of the enemy the American flag had an auspicious triumph . The frigate Constitution , commanded by Captain Hull , after a close and short engagement completely disabled and captured a British frigate , gaining for that officer and all on board a praise which can not be too liberally bestowed , not merely for the victory actually achieved , but for that prompt and cool exertion of commanding talents which , giving to courage its highest character , and to the force applied its full effect , proved that more could have been done in a contest requiring more . Anxious to abridge the evils from which a state of war can not be exempt , I lost no time after it was declared in conveying to the British Government the terms on which its progress might be arrested , without awaiting the delays of a formal and final pacification , and our charge d affaires at London was at the same time authorized to agree to an armistice founded upon them . These terms required that the orders in council should be repealed as they affected the United States , without a revival of blockades violating acknowledged rules , and that there should be an immediate discharge of American sea men from British ships , and a stop to impressment from American ships , with an understanding that an exclusion of the sea men of each nation from the ships of the other should be stipulated , and that the armistice should be improved into a definitive and comprehensive adjustment of depending controversies . Although a repeal of the orders susceptible of explanations meeting the views of this Government had taken place before this pacific advance was communicated to that of Great Britain , the advance was declined from an avowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressments during the armistice , and without any intimation that the arrangement proposed WRT sea men would be accepted . Whether the subsequent communications from this Government , affording an occasion for reconsidering the subject on the part of Great Britain , will be viewed in a more favorable light or received in a more accommodating spirit remains to be known . It would be unwise to relax our measures in any respect on a presumption of such a result . The documents from the Department of State which relate to this subject will give a view also of the propositions for an armistice which have been received here , one of them from the authorities at Halifax and in Canada , the other from the British Government itself through Admiral Warren , and of the grounds on which neither of them could be accepted . Our affairs with France retain the posture which they held at my last communications to you . Notwithstanding the authorized expectations of an early as well as favorable issue to the discussions on foot , these have been procrastinated to the latest date . The only intervening occurrence meriting attention is the promulgation of a French decree purporting to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees . This proceeding , although made the ground of the repeal of the British orders in council , is rendered by the time and manner of it liable to many objections . The final communications from our special minister to Denmark afford further proofs of the good effects of his mission , and of the amicable disposition of the Danish Government . From Russia we have the satisfaction to receive assurances of continued friendship , and that it will not be affected by the rupture between the United States and Great Britain . Sweden also professes sentiments favorable to the subsisting harmony . With the Barbary Powers , excepting that of Algiers , our affairs remain on the ordinary footing . The consul general residing with that Regency has suddenly and without cause been banished , together with all the American citizens found there . Whether this was the transitory effect of capricious despotism or the first act of predetermined hostility is not ascertained . Precautions were taken by the consul on the latter supposition . The Indian tribes not under foreign instigations remain at peace , and receive the civilizing attentions which have proved so beneficial to them . With a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which our national faculties are adequate , the attention of Congress will be particularly drawn to the insufficiency of existing provisions for filling up the military establishment . Such is the happy condition of our country , arising from the facility of subsistence and the high wages for every species of occupation , that notwithstanding the augmented inducements provided at the last session , a partial success only has attended the recruiting service . The deficiency has been necessarily supplied during the campaign by other than regular troops , with all the inconveniences and expense incident to them . The remedy lies in establishing more favorably for the private soldier the proportion between his recompense and the term of his enlistment , and it is a subject which can not too soon or too seriously be taken into consideration . The same insufficiency has been experienced in the provisions for volunteers made by an act of the last session . The recompense for the service required in this case is still less attractive than in the other , and although patriotism alone has sent into the field some valuable corps of that description , those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be reasonably expected to yield to that impulse . It will merit consideration also whether as auxiliary to the security of our frontiers corps may not be advantageously organized with a restriction of their services to particular districts convenient to them , and whether the local and occasional services of mariners and others in the sea port towns under a similar organization would not be a provident addition to the means of their defense . I recommend a provision for an increase of the general officers of the Army , the deficiency of which has been illustrated by the and distance of separate commands which the course of the war and the advantage of the service have required . And I can not press too strongly on the earliest attention of the Legislature the importance of the reorganization of the staff establishment with a view to render more distinct and definite the relations and responsibilities of its several departments . That there is room for improvements which will materially promote both economy and success in what appertains to the Army and the war is equally inculcated by the examples of other countries and by the experience of our own . A revision of the militia laws for the purpose of rendering them more systematic and better adapting them to emergencies of the war is at this time particularly desirable . Of the additional ships authorized to be fitted for service , two will be shortly ready to sail , a third is under repair , and delay will be avoided in the repair of the residue . Of the appropriations for the purchase of materials for ship building , the greater part has been applied to that object and the purchase will be continued with the balance . The enterprising spirit which has characterized our naval force and its success , both in restraining insults and depredations on our coasts and in reprisals on the enemy , will not fail to recommend an enlargement of it . There being reason to believe that the act prohibiting the acceptance of British licenses is not a sufficient guard against the use of them , for purposes favorable to the interests and views of the enemy , further provisions on that subject are highly important . Nor is it less so that penal enactments should be provided for cases of corrupt and perfidious intercourse with the enemy , not amounting to treason nor yet embraced by any statutory provisions . A considerable number of American vessels which were in England when the revocation of the orders in council took place were laden with British manufactures under an erroneous impression that the non importation act would immediately cease to operate , and have arrived in the United States . It did not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of such magnitude the powers vested in the Treasury Department to mitigate forfeitures without previously affording to Congress an opportunity of making on the subject such provision as they may think proper . In their decision they will doubtless equally consult what is due to equitable considerations and to the public interest . The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last have exceeded 16 . 5which have been sufficient to defray all the demands on the Treasury to that day , including a necessary reimbursement of near 3M of the principal of the public debt . In these receipts is included a sum of near 5 . 85received on account of the loans authorized by the acts of the last session the whole sum actually obtained on loan amounts to 11the residue of which , being receivable subsequent to the 30th of September last , will , together with the current revenue , enable us to defray all the expenses of this year . The duties on the late unexpected importations of British manufactures will render the revenue of the ensuing year more productive than could have been anticipated . The situation of our country , fellow citizens , is not without its difficulties , though it abounds in animating considerations , of which the view here presented of our pecuniary resources is an example . With more than one nation we have serious and unsettled controversies , and with one , powerful in the means and habits of war , we are at war . The spirit and strength of the nation are nevertheless equal to the support of all its rights , and to carry it through all its trials . They can be met in that confidence . Above all , we have the inestimable consolation of knowing that the war in which we are actually engaged is a war neither of ambition nor of vain glory that it is waged not in violation of the rights of others , but in the maintenance of our own that it was preceded by a patience without example under wrongs accumulating without end , and that it was finally not declared until every hope of averting it was extinguished by the transfer of the British scepter into new hands clinging to former councils , and until declarations were reiterated to the last hour , through the British envoy here , that the hostile edicts against our commercial rights and our maritime independence would not be revoked nay , that they could not be revoked without violating the obligations of Great Britain to other powers , as well as to her own interests . To have shrunk under such circumstances from manly resistance would have been a degradation blasting our best and proudest hopes it would have struck us from the high rank where the virtuous struggles of our fathers had placed us , and have betrayed the magnificent legacy which we hold in trust for future generations . It would have acknowledged that on the element which forms three fourth of the globe we inhabit , and where all independent nations have equal and common rights , the American people were not an independent people , but colonists and vassals . It was at this moment and with such an alternative that war was chosen . The nation felt the necessity of it , and called for it . The appeal was accordingly made , in a just cause , to the Just and All powerful Being who holds in His hand the chain of events and the destiny of nations . It remains only that , faithful to ourselves , entangled in no connections with the views of other powers , and ever ready to accept peace from the hand of justice , we prosecute the war with united counsels and with the ample faculties of the nation until peace be so obtained and as the only means under the Divine blessing of speedily obtaining it .<speech_sep>
