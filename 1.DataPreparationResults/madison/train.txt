Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives At an early day after the close of the last session of Congress an offer was formally communicated from His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia of his mediation , as the common friend of the United States and Great Britain , for the purpose of facilitating a peace between them . The high character of the Emperor Alexander being a satisfactory pledge for the sincerity and impartiality of his offer , it was immediately accepted , and as a further proof of the disposition on the part of the United States to meet their adversary in honorable experiments for terminating the war it was determined to avoid intermediate delays incident to the distance of the parties by a definitive provision for the contemplated negotiation . Three of our eminent citizens were accordingly commissioned with the requisite powers to conclude a treaty of peace with persons clothed with like powers on the part of Great Britain . They are authorized also to enter into such conventional regulations of the commerce between the two countries as may be mutually advantageous . The two envoys who where in the United States at the time of their appointment have proceeded to join their colleague already at Petersburg . The envoys have received another commission authorizing them to conclude with Russia a treaty of commerce with a view to strengthen the amicable relations and improve the beneficial intercourse between the two countries . The issue of this friendly interposition of the Russian Emperor and this pacific manifestation on the part of the United States time only can decide . That the sentiments of Great Britain toward that Sovereign will have produced an acceptance of his offered mediation must be presumed . That no adequate motives exist to prefer a continuance of war with the United States to the terms on which they are willing to close it is certain . The British cabinet also must be sensible that , with respect to the important question of impressment , on which the war so essentially turns , a search for or seizure of British persons or property on board neutral vessels on the high seas is not a belligerent right derived from the law of nations , and it is obvious that no visit or search or use of force for any purpose on board the vessels of one independent power on the high seas can in war or peace be sanctioned by the laws or authority of another power . It is equally obvious that , for the purpose of preserving to each State its seafaring members , by excluding them from the vessels of the other , the mode heretofore proposed by the United States and now enacted by them as an article of municipal policy , can not for a moment be compared with the mode practiced by Great Britain without a conviction of its title to preference , inasmuch as the latter leaves the discrimination between the mariners of the two nations to officers exposed by unavoidable bias as well as by a defect of evidence to a wrong decision , under circumstances precluding for the most part the enforcement of controlling penalties , and where a wrong decision , besides the irreparable violation of the sacred rights of persons , might frustrate the plans and profits of entire voyages whereas the mode assumed by the United States guards with studied fairness and efficacy against errors in such cases and avoids the effect of casual errors on the safety of navigation and the success of mercantile expeditions . If the reasonableness of expectations drawn from these considerations could guarantee their fulfillment a just peace would not be distant . But it becomes the wisdom of the National Legislature to keep in mind the true policy , or rather the indispensable obligation , of adapting its measures to the supposition that the only course to that happy event is in the vigorous employment of the resources of war . And painful as the reflection is , this duty is particularly enforced by the spirit and manner in which the war continues to be waged by the enemy , who , uninfluenced by the unvaried examples of humanity set them , are adding to the savage fury of it on one frontier a system of plunder and conflagration on the other , equally forbidden by respect for national character and by the established rules of civilized warfare . As an encouragement to persevering and invigorated exertions to bring the contest to a happy result , I have the satisfaction of being able to appeal to the auspicious progress of our arms both by land and on the water . In continuation of the brilliant achievements of our infant Navy , a signal triumph has been gained by Captain Lawrence and his companions in the Hornet sloop of war , which destroyed a British sloop of war with a celerity so unexampled and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the loss in the Hornet as to claim for the conquerors the highest praise and the full recompense provided by Congress in preceding cases . Our public ships of war in general , as well as the private armed vessels , have continued also their activity and success against the commerce of the enemy , and by their vigilance and address have greatly frustrated the efforts of the hostile squadrons distributed along our coasts to intercept them in returning into port and resuming their cruises . The augmentation of our naval force , as authorized at the last session of Congress , is in progress . On the Lakes our superiority is near at hand where it is not already established . The events of the campaign , so far as they are known to us , furnish matter of congratulation , and show that under a wise organization and efficient direction the Army is destined to a glory not less brilliant than that which already encircles the Navy . The attack and capture of York is in that quarter a presage of future and greater victories , while on the western frontier the issue of the late siege of Fort Meigs leaves us nothing to regret but a single act of inconsiderate valor . The provisions last made for filling the ranks and enlarging the staff of the Army have had the best effects . It will be for the consideration of Congress whether other provisions depending on their authority may not still further improve the military establishment and the means of defense . The sudden death of the distinguished citizen who represented the United States in France , without any special arrangements by him for such a contingency , has left us without the expected sequel to his last communications , nor has the French Government taken any measures for bringing the depending negotiations to a conclusion through its representative in the United States . This failure adds to delays before so unreasonably spun out . A successor to our deceased minister has been appointed and is ready to proceed on his mission . The course which he will pursue in fulfilling it is that prescribed by a steady regard to the true interests of the United States , which equally avoids an abandonment of their just demands and a connection of their fortunes with the systems of other powers . The receipts in the Treasury from the 1st of October to the 31st day of March last , including the sums received on account of Treasury notes and of the loans authorized by the acts of the last and the preceding sessions of Congress , have amounted to 15 , 412 , 000 . The expenditures during the same period amounted to 15 , 920 , 000 , and left in the Treasury on the 1st of April the sum of 1 , 857 , 000 . The loan of 16 , 000 , 000 , authorized by the act of the 8th of February last , has been contracted for . Of that sum more than 1 , 000 , 000 had been paid into the Treasury prior to the 1st of April , and formed a part of the receipts as above stated . The remainder of that loan , amounting to near 15 , 000 , 000 , with the sum of 5 , 000 , 000 authorized to be issued in Treasury notes , and the estimated receipts from the customs and the sales of public lands , amounting to 9 , 300 , 000 , and making , in the whole , 29 , 300 , 000 , to be received during the last nine months of the present year , will be necessary to meet the expenditures already authorized and the engagements contracted in relation to the public debt . These engagements amount during that period to 10 , 500 , 000 , which , with near one million for the civil , miscellaneous , and diplomatic expenses , both foreign and domestic , and 17 , 800 , 000 for the military and naval expenditures , including the ships of war building and to be built , will leave a sum in the Treasury at the end of the present year equal to that on the 1st of April last . A part of this sum may be considered as a resource for defraying any extraordinary expenses already authorized by law beyond the sums above estimated , and a further resource for any emergency may be found in the sum of 1 , 000 , 000 , the loan of which to the United States has been authorized by the State of Pennsylvania , but which has not yet been brought into effect . This view of our finances , whilst it shows that due provision has been made for the expenses of the current year , shows at the same time , by the limited amount of the actual revenue and the dependence on loans , the necessity of providing more adequately for the future supplies of the Treasury . This can be best done by a well digested system of internal revenue in aid of existing sources , which will have the effect both of abridging the amount of necessary loans and , on that account , as well as by placing the public credit on a more satisfactory basis , of improving the terms on which loans may be obtained . The loan of sixteen millions was not contracted for at a less interest than about 7 1 2 per cent , and , although other causes may have had an agency , it can not be doubted that , with the advantage of a more extended and less precarious revenue , a lower rate of interest might have sufficed . A longer postponement of this advantage could not fail to have a still greater influence on future loans . In recommending to the National Legislature this resort to additional taxes I feel great satisfaction in the assurance that our constituents , who have already displayed so much zeal and firmness in the cause of their country , will cheerfully give any other proof of their patriotism which it calls for . Happily no people , with local and transitory exceptions never to be wholly avoided , are more able than the people of the United States to spare for the public wants a portion of their private means , whether regard be had to the ordinary profits of industry or the ordinary price of subsistence in our country compared with those in any other . And in no case could stronger reasons be felt for yielding the requisite contributions . By rendering the public resources certain and commensurate to the public exigencies , the constituted authorities will be able to prosecute the war the more rapidly to its proper issue every hostile hope founded on a calculated failure of our resources will be cut off , and by adding to the evidence of bravery and skill in combats on the ocean and the land , and alacrity in supplying the treasure necessary to give them their fullest effect , and demonstrating to the world the public energy which our political institutions combine , with the personal liberty distinguishing them , the best security will be provided against future enterprises on the rights or the peace of the nation . The contest in which the United States are engaged appeals for its support to every motive that can animate an uncorrupted and enlightened people to the love of country to the pride of liberty to an emulation of the glorious founders of their independence by a successful vindication of its violated attributes to the gratitude and sympathy which demand security from the most degrading wrongs of a class of citizens who have proved themselves so worthy the protection of their country by their heroic zeal in its defense and , finally , to the sacred obligation of transmitting entire to future generations that precious patrimony of national rights and independence which is held in trust by the present from the goodness of Divine Providence . Being aware of the inconveniences to which a protracted session at this season would be liable , I limit the present communication to objects of primary importance . In special messages which may ensue regard will be had to the same consideration . JAMES MADISON .<speech_sep>Unwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority , I avail myself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression made on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of which I am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions . So distinguished a mark of confidence , proceeding from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation , would under any circumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion , as well as filled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed . Under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period , I feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced . The present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel and that of our own country full of difficulties . The pressure of these , too , is the more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a moment when the national prosperity being at a height not before attained , the contrast resulting from the change has been rendered the more striking . Under the benign influence of our republican institutions , and the maintenance of peace with all nations whilst so many of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars , the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and resources . Proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture , in the successful enterprises of commerce , in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts , in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt , and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land . It is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which has for some time been distressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views , nor , as I trust , on any involuntary errors in the public councils . Indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations , it has been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by observing justice , and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality . If there be candor in the world , the truth of these assertions will not be questioned posterity at least will do justice to them . This unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the belligerent powers . In their rage against each other , or impelled by more direct motives , principles of retaliation have been introduced equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledged law . How long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the demonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the United States , and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a revocation of them , can not be anticipated . Assuring myself that under every vicissitude the determined spirit and united councils of the nation will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests , I repair to the post assigned me with no other discouragement than what springs from my own inadequacy to its high duties . If I do not sink under the weight of this deep conviction it is because I find some support in a consciousness of the purposes and a confidence in the principles which I bring with me into this arduous service . To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nations to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities , so degrading to all countries and so baneful to free ones to foster a spirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others , too proud to surrender our own , too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves and too elevated not to look down upon them in others to hold the union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness to support the Constitution , which is the cement of the Union , as well in its limitations as in its authorities to respect the rights and authorities reserved to the States and to the people as equally incorporated with and essential to the success of the general system to avoid the slightest interference with the right of conscience or the functions of religion , so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction to preserve in their full energy the other salutary provisions in behalf of private and personal rights , and of the freedom of the press to observe economy in public expenditures to liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge of the public debts to keep within the requisite limits a standing military force , always remembering that an armed and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of republics that without standing armies their liberty can never be in danger , nor with large ones safe to promote by authorized means improvements friendly to agriculture , to manufactures , and to external as well as internal commerce to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty to carry on the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state as far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the fulfillment of my duty , they will be a resource which can not fail me . It is my good fortune , moreover , to have the path in which I am to tread lighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties by those who have marched before me . Of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak . I may , however , be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my heart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved country , gratefully bestowed or exalted talents zealously devoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness . But the source to which I look or the aids which alone can supply my deficiencies is in the well tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow citizens , and in the counsels of those representing them in the other departments associated in the care of the national interests . In these my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed , next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations , whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic , and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past , as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I have the satisfaction on our present meeting of being able to communicate to you the successful termination of the war which had been commenced against the United States by the Regency of Algiers . The squadron in advance on that service , under Commodore Decatur , lost not a moment after its arrival in the Mediterranean in seeking the naval force of the enemy then cruising in that sea , and succeeded in capturing two of his ships , one of them the principal ship , commanded by the Algerine admiral . The high character of the American commander was brilliantly sustained on that occasion which brought his own ship into close action with that of his adversary , as was the accustomed gallantry of all the officers and men actually engaged . Having prepared the way by this demonstration of American skill and prowess , he hastened to the port of Algiers , where peace was promptly yielded to his victorious force . In the terms stipulated the rights and honor of the United States were particularly consulted by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of the Dey of all pretensions to tribute from them . The impressions which have thus been made , strengthened as they will have been by subsequent transactions with the Regencies of Tunis and of Tripoli by the appearance of the larger force which followed under Commodore Bainbridge , the chief in command of the expedition , and by the judicious precautionary arrangements left by him in that quarter , afford a reasonable prospect of future security for the valuable portion of our commerce which passes within reach of the Barbary cruisers . It is another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with Great Britain has been succeeded by a convention on the subject of commerce concluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two countries . In this result a disposition is manifested on the part of that nation corresponding with the disposition of the United States , which it may be hoped will be improved into liberal arrangements on other subjects on which the parties have mutual interests , or which might endanger their future harmony . Congress will decide on the expediency of promoting such a sequel by giving effect to the measure of confining the American navigation to American seamen a measure which , at the same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency , would have the further advantage of increasing the independence of our navigation and the resources for our maritime defence . In conformity with the articles in the treaty of Ghent relating to the Indians , as well as with a view to the tranquillity of our western and northwestern frontiers , measures were taken to establish an immediate peace with the several tribes who had been engaged in hostilities against the United States . Such of them as were invited to Detroit acceded readily to a renewal of the former treaties of friendship . Of the other tribes who were invited to a station on the Mississippi the greater number have also accepted the peace offered to them . The residue , consisting of the more distant tribes or parts of tribes , remain to be brought over by further explanations , or by such other means as may be adapted to the dispositions they may finally disclose . The Indian tribes within and bordering on the southern frontier , whom a cruel war on their part had compelled us to chastise into peace , have latterly shown a restlessness which has called for preparatory measures for repressing it , and for protecting the commissioners engaged in carrying the terms of the peace into execution . The execution of the act fixing the military peace establishment has been attended with difficulties which even now can only be overcome by legislative aid . The selection of officers , the payment and discharge of the troops enlisted for the war , the payment of the retained troops and their reunion from detached and distant stations , the collection and security of the public property in the Quartermaster , Commissary , and Ordnance departments , and the constant medical assistance required in hospitals and garrisons rendered a complete execution of the act impracticable on the ist of May , the period more immediately contemplated . As soon , however , as circumstances would permit , and as far as it has been practicable consistently with the public interests , the reduction of the Army has been accomplished , but the appropriations for its pay and for other branches of the military service having proved inadequate , the earliest attention to that subject will be necessary , and the expediency of continuing upon the peace establishment the staff officers who have hitherto been provisionally retained is also recommended to the consideration of Congress . In the performance of the Executive duty upon this occasion there has not been wanting a just sensibility to the merits of the American Army during the late war , but the obvious policy and design in fixing an efficient military peace establishment did not afford an opportunity to distinguish the aged and infirm on account of their past services nor the wounded and disabled on account of their present sufferings The extent of the reduction , indeed , unavoidably involved the exclusion of many meritorious officers of every rank from the service of their country , and so equal as well as so numerous were the claims to attention that a decision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attained Judged , how ever , in candor by a general standard of positive merit , the Army register will , it is believed , do honor to the establish ment , while the case of those officers whose names are not in eluded in it devolves with the strongest interest upon the legislative authority for such provision as shall be deemed the best calculated to give support and solace to the veteran and the invalid , to display the beneficence as well as the justice of the Government , and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service upon every future emergency . Although the embarrassments arising from the want of an uniform national currency have not been diminished since the adjournment of Congress , great satisfaction has been denved in contemplating the revival of the public credit and the effi ciency of the public resources The receipts into the Treasury from the vanous branches of revenue during the nine months ending on the 30th of September last have been estimated at 12 , 500 , 000 , the issues of Treasury notes of every denomination during the same period amounted to the sum of 14 , 000 , 000 , and there was also obtained upon loan during the same period a sum of 9 , 000 , 000 , of which the sum of 6 , 000 , 000 was subscribed in cash and the sum of 3 , 000 , 000 in Treasury notes With these means , added to the sum of 1 , 500 , 000 , being the balance of money in the Treasury on the ist day of January , there has been paid be tween the ist of January and the ist of October on account of the appropriations of the preceding and of the present year exclusively of the amount of the Treasury notes subscribed to the loan and of the amount redeemed in the payment of du ties and taxes the aggregate sum of 33 , 500 , 000 , leaving a balance then in the Treasury estimated at the sum of 3 , 000 , 000 Independent , however , of the arrearages due for military services and supplies , it is presumed that a further sum of 5 , 000 , 000 , including the interest on the public debt payable on the ist of January next , will be demanded at the Treasury to compete the expenditures of the present year , and for which the existing ways and means will sufficiently provide . The national debt , as it was ascertained on the ist of Octo ber last , amounted in the whole to the sum of 120 , 000 , 000 , consisting of the unredeemed balance of the debt contracted before the late war 39 , 000 , 000 , the amount of the funded debt contracted in consequence of the war 64 , 000 , 000 , and the amount of the unfunded and floating debt , including the vanous issues of Treasury notes , 17 , 000 , 000 , which is in a gradual course of payment There will probably be some ad dition to the public debt upon the liquidation of various claims which are depending , and a conciliatory disposition on the part of Congress may lead honorably and advantageously to an equitable arrangement of the militia expenses incurred by the several States without the previous sanction or authority of the Government of the United States , but when it is considered that the new as well as the old portion of the debt has been contracted in the assertion of the national rights and independence , and when it is recollected that the public expenditures , not being exclusively bestowed upon subjects of a transient nature , will long be visible in the number and equip ments of the American Navy , in the military works for the de fense of our harbors and our frontiers , and in the supplies of our arsenals and magazines the amount will bear a gratifying comparison with the objects which have been attained , as well as with the resources of the country . The arrangements of the finances with a view to the receipts and expenditures of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into the deliberations of Congress during the present session . It is true that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the means of maintaining the faith of the Government with its creditors inviolate , and of prosecuting successfully the measures of the most liberal policy , but will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burdens imposed by the necessities of the war . It is , however , essential to every modification of the finances that the benefits of an uniform national currency should be restored to the community . The absence of the precious metals will , it is believed , be a temporary evil , but until they can again be rendered the general medium of exchange it devolves on the wisdom of Congress to provide a substitute which shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the wants of the citizens throughout the Union . If the operation of the State banks can not produce this result , the probable operation of a national bank will merit consideration and if neither of these expedients be deemed effectual it may become necessary to ascertain the terms upon which the notes of the Government no longer required as an instrument of credit shall be issued upon motives of general policy as a common medium of circulation . Notwithstanding the security for future repose which the United States ought to find in their love of peace and their constant respect for the rights of other nations , the character of the times particularly inculcates the lesson that , whether to prevent or repel danger , we ought not to be unprepared for it . This consideration will sufficiently recommend to Congress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual completion of the works of defense , both fixed and floating , on our maritime frontier , and an adequate provision for guarding our inland frontier against dangers to which certain portions of it may continue to be exposed . As an improvement in our military establishment , it will deserve the consideration of Congress whether a corps of invalids might not be so organized and employed as at once to aid in the support of meritorious individuals excluded by age or infirmities from the existing establishment , and to procure to the public the benefit of their stationary services and of their exemplary discipline . I recommend also an enlargement of the Military Academy already established , and the establishment of others in other sections of the Union and I can not press too much on the attention of Congress such a classification and organization of the militia as will most effectually render it the safeguard of a free state . If experience has shewn in the recent splendid achievements of militia the value of this resource for the public defense , it has shewn also the importance of that skill in the use of arms and that familiarity with the essential rules of discipline which can not be expected from the regulations now in force . With this subject is intimately connected the necessity of accommodating the laws in every respect to the great object of enabling the political authority of the Union to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of the Union in the cases designated by the Constitution . The signal services which have been rendered by our Navy and the capacities it has developed for successful co operation in the national defense will give to that portion of the public force its full value in the eyes of Congress , at an epoch which calls for the constant vigilance of all governments . To preserve the ships now in a sound state , to complete those already contemplated , to provide amply the imperishable materials for prompt augmentations , and to improve the existing arrangements into more advantageous establishments for the construction , the repairs , and the security of vessels of war is dictated by the soundest policy . In adjusting the duties on imports to the object of revenue the influence of the tariff on manufactures will necessarily present itself for consideration . However wise the theory may be which leaves to the sagacity and interest of individuals the application of their industry and resources , there are in this as in other cases exceptions to the general rule . Besides the condition which the theory itself implies of a reciprocal adoption by other nations , experience teaches that so many circumstances must concur in introducing and maturing manufacturing establishments , especially of the more complicated kinds , that a country may remain long without them , although sufficiently advanced and in some respects even peculiarly fitted for carrying them on with success . Under circumstances giving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry it has made among us a progress and exhibited an efficiency which justify the belief that with a protection not more than is due to the enterprising citizens whose interests are now at stake it will become at an early day not only safe against occasional competitions from abroad , but a source of domestic wealth and even of external commerce . In selecting the branches more especially entitled to the public patronage a preference is obviously claimed by such as will relieve the United States from a dependence on foreign supplies ever subject to casual failures , for articles necessary for the public defense or connected with the primary wants of individuals . It will be an additional recommendation of particular manufactures where the materials for them are extensively drawn from our agriculture , and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of national prosperity and independence an encouragement which can not fail to be rewarded . Among the means of advancing the public interest the occasion is a proper one for recalling the attention of Congress to the great importance of establishing throughout our country the roads and canals which can best be executed under the national authority . No objects within the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense bestowed on them there are none the utility of which is more universally ascertained and acknowledged none that do more honor to the governments whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates them . Nor is there any country which presents a field where nature invites more the art of man to complete her own work for his accommodation and benefit . These considerations are strengthened , moreover , by the political effect of these facilities for intercommunication in bringing and binding more closely together the various parts of our extended confederacy . Whilst the States individually , with a laudable enterprise and emulation , avail themselves of their local advantages by new roads , by navigable canals , and by improving the streams susceptible of navigation , the General Government is the more urged to similar undertakings , requiring a national jurisdiction and national means , by the prospect of thus systematically completing so inestimable a work and it is a happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority which may be encountered can be supplied in a mode which the Constitution itself has providently pointed out . The present is a favorable season also for bringing again into view the establishment of a national seminary of learning within the District of Columbia , and with means drawn from the property therein , subject to the authority of the General Government . Such an institution claims the patronage of Congress as a monument of their solicitude for the advancement of knowledge , without which the blessings of liberty can not be fully enjoyed or long preserved as a model instructive in the formation of other seminaries as a nursery of enlightened preceptors , and as a central resort of youth and genius from every part of their country , diffusing on their return examples of those national feelings , those liberal sentiments , and those congenial manners which contribute cement to our Union and strength to the great political fabric of which that is the foundation . In closing this communication I ought not to repress a sensibility , in which you will unite , to the happy lot of our country and to the goodness of a superintending Providence , to which we are indebted for it . Whilst other portions of mankind are laboring under the distresses of war or struggling with adversity in other forms , the United States are in the tranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace . In reviewing the scenes through which it has been attained we can rejoice in the proofs given that our political institutions , founded in human rights and framed for their preservation , are equal to the severest trials of war as well as adapted to the ordinary periods of repose . As fruits of this experience and of the reputation acquired by the American arms on the land and on the water , the nation finds itself possessed of a growing respect abroad and of a just confidence in itself , which are among the best pledges for its peaceful career . Under other aspects of our country the strongest features of its flourishing condition are seen in a population rapidly increasing on a territory as productive as it is extensive in a general industry and fertile ingenuity which find their ample rewards , and in an affluent revenue which admits a reduction of the public burdens without withdrawing the means of sustaining the public credit , of gradually discharging the public debt , of providing for the necessary defensive and precautionary establishments , and of patronizing in every authorized mode undertakings conducive to the aggregate wealth and individual comfort of our citizens . It remains for the guardians of the public welfare to persevere in that justice and good will toward other nations which invite a return of these sentiments toward the United States to cherish institutions which guarantee their safety and their liberties , civil and religious and to combine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the national advantages and a protection and extension of the independent resources of our highly favored and happy country . In all measures having such objects my faithful co operation will be afforded .<speech_sep>Whereas the Congress of the United States , by a joint resolution of the two Houses , have signified a request that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity as a day of public humiliation and prayer andWhereas such a recommendation will enable the several religious denominations and societies so disposed to offer at one and the same time their common vows and adorations to Almighty God on the solemn occasion produced by the war in which He has been pleased to permit the injustice of a foreign power to involve these United States I do therefore recommend the third Thursday in August next as a convenient day to be set apart for the devout purposes of rendering the Sovereign of the Universe and the Benefactor of Mankind the public homage due to His holy attributes of acknowledging the transgressions which might justly provoke the manifestations of His divine displeasure of seeking His merciful forgiveness and His assistance in the great duties of repentance and amendment , and especially of offering fervent supplications that in the present season of calamity and war He would take the American people under His peculiar care and protection that He would guide their public councils , animate their patriotism , and bestow His blessing on their arms that He would inspire all nations with a love of justice and of concord and with a reverence for the unerring precept of our holy religion to do to others as they would require that others should do to them and , finally , that , turning the hearts of our enemies from the violence and injustice which sway their councils against us , He would hasten a restoration of the blessings of peace .

JAMES MADISOBy the President JAMES MONROE , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION Whereas the Congress of the United States , by virtue of the constituted authority vested in them , have declared by their act bearing date the 18th day of the present month that war exists between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the dependencies thereof and the United States of America and their Territories Now , therefore , James Madison , President of the United States of America , do hereby proclaim the same to all whom it may concern and I do specially enjoin on all persons holding offices , civil or military , under the authority of the United States that they be vigilant and zealous in discharging the duties respectively incident thereto and I do moreover exhort all the good people of the United States , as they love their country , as they value the precious heritage derived from the virtue and valor of their fathers , as they feel the wrongs which have forced on them the last resort of injured nations , and as they consult the best means under the blessing of Divine Providence of abridging its calamities , that they exert themselves in preserving order , in promoting concord , in maintaining the authority and efficacy of the laws , and in supporting and invigorating all the measures which may be adopted by the constituted authorities for obtaining a speedy , a just , and an honorable peace . In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents . Done at the city of Washington , the 19th day of June , 1812 , and of the Independence of the United States the thirty sixth . By the President JAMES MADISON . JAMES MONROE , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The embarrassments which have prevailed in our foreign relations , and so much employed the deliberations of Congress , make it a primary duty in meeting you to communicate whatever may have occurred in that branch of our national affairs . The act of the last session of Congress concerning the commercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain and France and their dependencies having invited in a new form a termination of their edicts against our neutral commerce , copies of the act were immediately forwarded to our ministers at London and Paris , with a view that its object might be within the early attention of the French and British Governments . By the communication received through our minister at Paris it appeared that knowledge of the act by the French Government was followed by a declaration that the Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked , and would cease to have effect on the first day of November ensuing . These being the only known edicts of France within the description of the act , and the revocation of them being such that they ceased at that date to violate our neutral commerce , the fact , as prescribed by law , was announced by a proclamation bearing date the 2nd of November . It would have well accorded with the conciliatory views indicated by this proceeding on the part of France to have extended them to all the grounds of just complaint which now remain unadjusted with the United States . It was particularly anticipated that , as a further evidence of just dispositions toward them , restoration would have been immediately made of the property of our citizens under a misapplication of the principle of reprisals combined with a misconstruction of a law of the United States . This expectation has not been fulfilled . From the British Government no communication on the subject of the act has been received . To a communication from our minister at London of a revocation by the French Government of its Berlin and Milan decrees it was answered that the British system would be relinquished as soon as the repeal of the French decrees should have actually taken effect and the commerce of neutral nations have been restored to the condition in which it stood previously to the promulgation of those decrees . This pledge , although it does not necessarily import , does not exclude the intention of relinquishing , along with the others in council , the practice of those novel blockades which have a like effect of interrupting our neutral commerce , and this further justice to the United States is the rather to be looked for , in as much as the blockades in question , being not more contrary to the established law of nations than inconsistent with the rules of blockade formally recognized by Great Britain herself , could have no alleged basis other than the plea of retaliation alleged as the basis of the orders in council . Under the modification of the original orders of 1807 November , into the orders of 1809 April , there is , indeed , scarcely a nominal distinction between the orders and the blockades . One of those illegitimate blockades , bearing date in 1806 May , having been expressly avowed to be still unrescinded , and to be in effect comprehended in the orders in council , was too distinctly brought within the purview of the act of Congress not to be comprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a compliance with it . The British Government was accordingly apprised by our minister near it that such was the light in which the subject was to be regarded . On the other important subjects depending between the United States and the Government no progress has been made from which an early and satisfactory result can be relied on . In this new posture of our relations with those powers the consideration of Congress will be properly turned to a removal of doubts which may occur in the exposition and of difficulties in the execution of the act above cited . The commerce of the United States with the north of Europe , heretofore much vexed by licentious cruisers , particularly under the Danish flag , has latterly been visited with fresh and extensive depredations . The measures pursued in behalf of our injured citizens not having obtained justice for them , a further and more formal interposition with the Danish Government is contemplated . The principles which have been maintained by that Government in relation to neutral commerce , and the friendly professions of His Danish Majesty toward the United States , are valuable pledges in favor of a successful issue . Among the events growing out of the state of the Spanish Monarchy , our attention was imperiously attracted to the change developing itself in that portion of West Florida which , though of right appertaining to the United States , had remained in the possession of Spain awaiting the result of negotiations for its actual delivery to them . The Spanish authority was subverted and a situation produced exposing the country to ulterior events which might essentially affect the rights and welfare of the Union . In such a conjuncture I did not delay the interposition required for the occupancy of the territory west of the river Perdido , to which the title of the United States extends , and to which the laws provided for the Territory of Orleans are applicable . With this view , the proclamation of which a copy is laid before you was confided to the governor of that Territory to be carried into effect . The legality and necessity of the course pursued assure me of the favorable light in which it will present itself to the Legislature , and of the promptitude with which they will supply whatever provisions may be due to the essential rights and equitable interests of the people thus brought into the bosom of the American family . Our amity with the powers of Barbary , with the exception of a recent occurrence at Tunis , of which an explanation is just received , appears to have been uninterrupted and to have become more firmly established . With the Indian tribes also the peace and friendship of the United States are found to be so eligible that the general disposition to preserve both continues to gain strength . I feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an interior view of our country presents us with grateful proofs of its substantial and increasing prosperity . To a thriving agriculture and the improvements related to it is added a highly interesting extension of useful manufactures , the combined product of professional occupations and of household industry . Such indeed is the experience of economy as well as of policy in these substitutes for supplies heretofore obtained by foreign commerce that in a national view the change is justly regarded as of itself more than a recompense for those privations and losses resulting from foreign injustice which furnished the general impulse required for its accomplishment . How far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor by regulations of the commercial tariff is a subject which can not fail to suggest itself to your patriotic reflections . It will rest with the consideration of Congress also whether a provident as well as fair encouragement would not be given to our navigation by such regulations as would place it on a level of competition with foreign vessels , particularly in transporting the important and bulky productions of our own soil . The failure of equality and reciprocity in the existing regulations on this subject operates in our ports as a premium to foreign competitors , and the inconvenience must increase as these may be multiplied under more favorable circumstances by the more than countervailing encouragements now given them by the laws of their respective countries . Whilst it is universally admitted that a well instructed people alone can be permanently a free people , and whilst it is evident that the means of diffusing and improving useful knowledge form so small a proportion of the expenditures for national purposes , I can not presume it to be unseasonable to invite your attention to the advantages of superadding to the means of education provided by the several States a seminary of learning instituted by the National Legislature within the limits of their exclusive jurisdiction , the expense of which might be defrayed or reimbursed out of the vacant grounds which have accrued to the nation within those limits . Such an institution , though local in its legal character , would be universal in its beneficial effects . By enlightening the opinions , by expanding the patriotism , and by assimilating the principles , the sentiments , and the manners of those who might resort to this temple of science , to be redistributed in due time through every part of the community , sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished , the features of national character would be multiplied , and greater extent given to social harmony . But , above all , a well constituted seminary in the center of the nation is recommended by the consideration that the additional instruction emanating from it would contribute not less to strengthen the foundations than to adorn the structure of our free and happy system of government . Among the commercial abuses still committed under the American flag , and leaving in force my former reference to that subject , it appears that American citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved Africans , equally in violation of the laws of humanity and in defiance of those of their own country . The same just and benevolent motives which produced interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be felt by Congress in devising further means of suppressing the evil . In the midst of uncertainties necessarily connected with the great interests of the United States , prudence requires a continuance of our defensive and precautionary arrangement . The Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy will submit the statements and estimates which may aid Congress in their ensuing provisions for the land and naval forces . The statements of the latter will include a view of the transfers of appropriations in the naval expenditures and in the grounds on which they were made . The fortifications for the defense of our maritime frontier have been prosecuted according to the plan laid down in 1808 . The works , with some exceptions , are completed and furnished with ordnance . Those for the security of the city of New York , though far advanced toward completion , will require a further time and appropriation . This is the case with a few others , either not completed or in need of repairs . The improvements in quality and quantity made in the manufacture of cannon and small arms , both at the public armories and private factories , warrant additional confidence in the competency of these resources for supplying the public exigencies . These preparations for arming the militia having thus far provided for 1 of the objects contemplated by the power vested in Congress with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety , it is for their consideration whether further provisions are not requisite for the other contemplated objects of organization and discipline . To give to this great mass of physical and moral force the efficiency which it merits , and is capable of receiving , it is indispensable that they should be instructed and practiced in the rules by which they are to be governed . Toward an accomplishment of this important work I recommend for the consideration of Congress the expediency of instituting a system which shall in the first instance call into the field at the public expense and for a given time certain portions of the commissioned and non commissioned officers . The instruction and discipline thus acquired would gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia that practical knowledge and promptitude for active service which are the great ends to be pursued . Experience has left no doubt either of the necessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those portions of an army in fitting it for the final duties which it may have to perform . The Corps of Engineers , with the Military Academy , are entitled to the early attention of Congress . The buildings at the seat fixed by law for the present Academy are so far in decay as not to afford the necessary accommodation . But a revision of the law is recommended , principally with a view to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantages of such institutions , by providing professorships for all the necessary branches of military instruction , and by the establishment of an additional academy at the seat of Government or elsewhere . The means by which war , as well for defense as for offense , are now carried on render these schools of the more scientific operations an indispensable part of every adequate system . Even among nations whose large standing armies and frequent wars afford every other opportunity of instruction these establishments are found to be indispensable for the due attainment of the branches of military science which require a regular course of study and experiment . In a government happily without the other opportunities seminaries where the elementary principles of the art of war can be taught without actual war , and without the expense of extensive and standing armies , have the precious advantage of uniting an essential preparation against external danger with a scrupulous regard to internal safety . In no other way , probably , can a provision of equal efficacy for the public defense be made at so little expense or more consistently with the public liberty . The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last and amounting to more than 8 . 5have exceeded the current expenses of the Government , including the interest on the public debt . For the purpose of reimbursing at the end of the year 3 . 75 of the principal , a loan , as authorized by law , had been negotiated to that amount , but has since been reduced to 2 . 75the reduction being permitted by the state of the Treasury , in which there will be a balance remaining at the end of the year estimated at 2For the probably receipts of the next year and other details I refer to statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury , and which will enable you to judge what further provisions may be necessary for the ensuing years . Reserving for future occasions in the course of the session whatever other communications may claim your attention , I close the present by expressing my reliance , under the blessing of Divine Providence , on the judgement and patriotism which will guide your measures at a period particularly calling for united councils and flexible exertions for the welfare of our country , and by assuring you of the fidelity and alacrity with which my cooperation will be afforded .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States I lay before Congress copies of the treaty of peace and amity between the United States and His Britannic Majesty , which was signed by the commissioners of both parties at Ghent on the 24th of December , 1814 , and the ratifications of which have been duly exchanged . While performing this act I congratulate you and our constituents upon an event which is highly honorable to the nation , and terminates with peculiar felicity a campaign signalized by the most brilliant successes . The late war , although reluctantly declared by Congress , had become a necessary resort to assert the rights and independence of the nation . It has been waged with a success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative councils , of the patriotism of the people , of the public spirit of the militia , and of the valor of the military and naval forces of the country Peace , at all times a blessing , is peculiarly wel come , therefore , at a period when the causes for the war have ceased to operate , when the Government has demonstrated the efficiency of its powers of defense , and when the nation can review its conduct without regret and without reproach . I recommend to your care and beneficence the gallant men whose achievements in every department of the military ser vice , on the land and on the water , have so essentially con tributed to the honor of the American name and to the restoration of peace . The feelings of conscious patriotism and worth will animate such men under every change of for tune and pursuit , but their country performs a duty to itself when it bestows those testimonials of approbation and applause which are at once the reward and the incentive to great actions . The reduction of the public expenditures to the demands of a peace establishment will doubtless engage the immediate attention of Congress There are , however , important consid erations which forbid a sudden and general revocation of the measures that have been produced by the war Experience has taught us that neither the pacific dispositions of the American people nor the pacific character of their political institutions can altogether exempt them from that strife which appears beyond the ordinary lot of nations to be incident to the ac tual period of the world , and the same faithful monitor dem onstrates that a certain degree of preparation for war is not only indispensable to avert disasters in the onset , but affords also the best security for the continuance of peace The wisdom of Congress will therefore , I am confident , provide for the maintenance of an adequate regular force , for the gradual advancement of the naval establishment , for improving all the means of harbor defense , for adding discipline to the distin guished bravery of the militia , and for cultivating the military art in its essential branches , under the liberal patronage of Government . The resources of our country were at all times competent to the attainment of every national object , but they will now be enriched and invigorated by the activity which peace will introduce into all the scenes of domestic enterprise and labor . The provision that has been made for the public creditors during the present session of Congress must have a decisive effect in the establishment of the public credit both at home and abroad The reviving interests of commerce will claim the legislative attention at the earliest opportunity , and such reg ulations will , I trust , be seasonably devised as shall secure to the United States their just proportion of the navigation of the world The most liberal policy toward other nations , if met by corresponding dispositions , will in this respect be found the most beneficial policy toward ourselves But there is no subject that can enter with greater force and merit into the deliberations of Congress than a consideration of the means to preserve and promote the manufactures which have sprung into existence and attained an unparalleled maturity throughout the United States during the period of the Euro pean wars This source of national independence and wealth I anxiously recommend , therefore , to the prompt and constant guardianship of Congress . The termination of the legislative sessions will soon sepa rate you , fellow citizens , from each other , and restore you to your constituents I pray you to bear with you the expressions of my sanguine hope that the peace which has been just declared , will not only be the foundation of the most friendly intercourse between the United States and Great Britain , but that it will also be productive of happiness and harmony in every section of our beloved country The influence of your precepts and example must be every where powerful , and while we accord in grateful acknowledgments for the protec tion which Providence has bestowed upon us , let us never cease to inculcate obedience to the laws , and fidelity to the union , as constituting the palladium of the national independence and prosperity .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives In meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture it would have been highly satisfactory if I could have communicated a favorable result to the mission charged with negotiations for restoring peace . It was a just expectation , from the respect due to the distinguished Sovereign who had invited them by his offer of mediation , from the readiness with which the invitation was accepted on the part of the United States , and from the pledge to be found in an act of their Legislature for the liberality which their plenipotentiaries would carry into the negotiations , that no time would be lost by the British Government in embracing the experiment for hastening a stop to the effusion of blood . A prompt and cordial acceptance of the mediation on that side was the less to be doubted , as it was of a nature not to submit rights or pretensions on either side to the decision of an umpire , but to afford merely an opportunity , honorable and desirable to both , for discussing and , if possible , adjusting them for the interest of both . The British cabinet , either mistaking our desire of peace for a dread of British power or misled by other fallacious calculations , has disappointed this reasonable anticipation . No communications from our envoys having reached us , no information on the subject has been received from that source but it is known that the mediation was declined in the 1st instance , and there is no evidence , notwithstanding the lapse of time , that a change of disposition in the British councils has taken place or is to be expected . Under such circumstances a nation proud of its rights and conscious of its strength has no choice but an exertion of the 1 in support of the other . To this determination the best encouragement is derived from the success with which it has pleased the Almighty to bless our arms both on the land and on the water . Whilst proofs have been continued of the enterprise and skill of our cruisers , public and private , on the ocean , and a trophy gained in the capture of a British by an American vessel of war , after an action giving celebrity to the name of the victorious commander , the great inland waters on which the enemy were also to be encountered have presented achievements of our naval arms as brilliant in their character as they have been important in their consequences . On Lake Erie , the squadron under command of Captain Perry having met the British squadron of superior force , a sanguinary conflict ended in the capture of the whole . The conduct of that officer , adroit as it was daring , and which was so well seconded by his comrades , justly entitles them to the admiration and gratitude of their country , and will fill an early page in its naval annals with a victory never surpassed in luster , however much it may have been in magnitude . On Lake Ontario the caution of the British commander , favored by contingencies , frustrated the efforts of the American commander to bring on a decisive action . Captain Chauncey was able , however , to establish an ascendancy on that important theater , and to prove by the manner in which he effected everything possible that opportunities only were wanted for a more shining display of his own talents and the gallantry of those under his command . The success on Lake Erie having opened a passage to the territory of the enemy , the officer commanding the Northwestern army transferred the war thither , and rapidly pursuing the hostile troops , fleeing with their savage associates , forced a general action , which quickly terminated in the capture of the British and dispersion of the savage force . This result is signally honorable to Major General Harrison , by whose military talents it was prepared to Colonel Johnson and his mounted volunteers , whose impetuous onset gave a decisive blow to the ranks of the enemy , and to the spirit of the volunteer militia , equally brave and patriotic , who bore an interesting part in the scene more especially to the chief magistrate of Kentucky , at the head of them , whose heroism signalized in the war which established the independence of his country , sought at an advanced age a share in hardships and battles for maintaining its rights and its safely . The effect of these successes has been to rescue the inhabitants of MI from their oppressions , aggravated by gross infractions of the capitulation which subjected them to a foreign power to alienate the savages of numerous tribes from the enemy , by whom they were disappointed and abandoned , and to relieve an extensive region of country from a merciless warfare which desolated its frontiers and imposed on its citizens the most harassing services . In consequences of our naval superiority on Lake Ontario and the opportunity afforded by it for concentrating our forces by water , operations which had been provisionally planned were set on foot against the possessions of the enemy on the Lawrence . Such , however , was the delay produced in the 1st instance by adverse weather of unusual violence and continuance and such the circumstances attending the final movements of the army , that the prospect , at one time so favorable , was not realized . The cruelty of the enemy in enlisting the savages into a war with a nation desirous of mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities has not been confined to any one quarter . Wherever they could be turned against us no exertions to effect it have been spared . On our southwestern border the Creek tribes , who , yielding to our persevering endeavors , were gradually acquiring more civilized habits , became the unfortunate victims of seduction . A war in that quarter has been the consequence , infuriated by a bloody fanaticism recently propagated among them . It was necessary to crush such a war before it could spread among the contiguous tribes and before it could favor enterprises of the enemy into that vicinity . With this view a force was called into the service of the United States from the States of Georgia and Tennessee , which , with the nearest regular troops and other corps from the Massachussets Territory , might not only chastise the savages into present peace but make a lasting impression on their fears . The progress of the expedition , as far as is yet known , corresponds with the martial zeal with which it was espoused , and the best hopes of a satisfactory issue are authorized by the complete success with which a well planned enterprise was executed against a body of hostile savages by a detachment of the volunteer militia of Tunder the gallant command of General Coffee , and by a still more important victory over a larger body of them , gained under the immediate command of Major General Jackson , an officer equally distinguished for his patriotism and his military talents . The systematic perseverance of the enemy in courting the aid of the savages in all quarters had the natural effect of kindling their ordinary propensity to war into a passion , which , even among those best disposed toward the United States , was ready , if not employed on our side , to be turned against us . A departure from our protracted forbearance to accept the services tendered by them has thus been forced upon us . But in yielding to it the retaliation has been mitigated as much as possible , both in its extent and in its character , stopping far short of the example of the enemy , who owe the advantages they have occasionally gained in battle chiefly to the of their savage associates , and who have not controlled them either from their usual practice of indiscriminate massacre on defenseless inhabitants or from scenes of carnage without a parallel on prisoners to the British arms , guarded by all the laws of humanity and of honorable war . For these enormities the enemy are equally responsible , whether with the power to prevent them they want the will or with the knowledge of a want of power they still avail themselves of such instruments . In other respects the enemy are pursuing a course which threatens consequences most afflicting to humanity . A standing law of Great Britain naturalizes , as is well known , all aliens complying with conditions limited to a shorter period than those required by the United States , and naturalized subjects are in war employed by her Government in common with native subjects . In a contiguous British Province regulations promulgated since the commencement of the war compel citizens of the United States being there under certain circumstances to bear arms , whilst of the native emigrants from the United States , who compose much of the population of the Province , a number have actually borne arms against the United States within their limits , some of whom , after having done so , have become prisoners of war , and are now in our possession . The British commander in that Province , nevertheless , with the sanction , as appears , of his Government , thought proper to select from American prisoners of war and send to Great Britain for trial as criminals a of individuals who had emigrated from the British dominions long prior to the state of war between the two nations , who had incorporated themselves into our political society in the modes recognized by the law and the practice of Great Britain , and who were made prisoners of war under the banners of their adopted country , fighting for its rights and its safety . The protection due to these citizens requiring an effectual interposition in their behalf , a like numver of British prisoners of war were put into confinement , with a notification that they would experience whatever violence might be committed on the American prisoners of war sent to Great Britain . It was hoped that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly taken on the part of Great Britain would have led her Government to reflect on the inconsistencies of its conduct , and that a sympathy with the British , if not with the American , sufferers would have arrested the cruel career opened by its example . This was unhappily not the case . In violation both of consistency and of humanity , American officers and non commissioned officers in double the number of the British soldiers confined here were ordered into close confinement , with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the death which might be inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great Britain for trial the officers so confined would be put to death also . It was notified at the same time that the commanders of the British fleets and armies on our coasts are instructed in the same event to proceed with a destructive severity against our towns and their inhabitants . That no doubt might be left with the enemy of our adherence to the retaliatory resort imposed on us , a correspondent number of British officers , prisoners of war in our hands , were immediately put into close confinement to abide the fate of those confined by the enemy , and the British Government was apprised of the determination of this Government to retaliate any other proceedings against us contrary to the legitimate modes of warfare . It is fortunate for the United States that they have it in their power to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest as it is honorable to them that they do not join in it but under the most imperious obligations , and with the humane purpose of effectuating a return to the established usages of war . The views of the French Government on the subjects which have been so long committed to negotiation have received no elucidation since the close of your late session . The minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris had not been enabled by proper opportunities to press the objects of his mission as prescribed by his instructions . The militia being always to be regarded as the great bulwark of defense and security for free states , and the Constitution having wisely committed to the national authority a use of that force as the best provision against an unsafe military establishment , as well as a resource peculiarly adapted to a country having the extent and the exposure of the United States , I recommend to Congress a revision of the militia laws for the purpose of securing more effectually the services of all detachments called into the employment and placed under the Government of the United States . It will deserve the consideration of Congress also whether among other improvements in the militia laws justice does not require a regulation , under due precautions , for defraying the expense incident to the 1st assembling as well as the subsequent movements of detachments called into the national service . To give to our vessels of war , public and private , the requisite advantage in their cruises , it is of much importance that they should have , both for themselves and their prizes , the use of the ports and markets of friendly powers . With this view , I recommend to Congress the expediency of such legal provisions as may supply the defects or remove the doubts of the Executive authority , to allow to the cruisers of other powers at war with enemies of the United States such use of the American ports as may correspond with the privileges allowed by such powers to American cruisers . During the year ending on the 30 of September last the receipts into the Treasury have exceeded 37 . 5of which near 24M were the produce of loans . After meeting all demands for the public service there remained in the Treasury on that day near 7Under the authority contained in the act of the 2nd of August last for borrowing 7 . 5that sum has been obtained on terms more favorable to the United States than those of the preceding loans made during the present year . Further sums to a considerable amount will be necessary to be obtained in the same way during the ensuing year , and from the increased capital of the country , from the fidelity with which the public engagements have been kept and the public credit maintained , it may be expected on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies will not be wanting . The expenses of the current year , from the multiplied operations falling within it , have necessarily been extensive but on a just estimate of the campaign in which the mass of them has been incurred the cost will not be found disproportionate to the advantages which have been gained . The campaign has , indeed , in its latter stages in one quarter been less favorable than was expected , but in addition to the importance of our naval success the progress of the campaign has been filled with incidents highly honorable to the American arms . The attacks of the enemy on Craney Island , on Fort Meigs , on Sacketts Harbor , and on Sandusky have been vigorously and successfully repulsed nor have they in any case succeeded on either frontier excepting when directed against the peaceable dwellings of individuals or villages unprepared or undefended . On the other hand , the movements of the American Army have been followed by the reduction of York , and of Forts George , Erie , and Malden by the recovery of Detroit and the extinction of the Indian war in the West , and by the occupancy or command of a large portion of Upper Canada . Battles have also been fought on the borders of the Lawrence , which , though not accomplishing their entire objects , reflect honor on the discipline and prowess of our soldiery , the best auguries of eventual victory . In the same scale are to be placed the late successes in the South over one of the most powerful , which had become one of the most hostile also , of the Indian tribes . It would be improper to close this communication without expressing a thankfulness in which all ought to unite for the abundance for the preservation of our internal tranquillity , and the stability of our free institutions , and , above all , for the light of divine truth and the protection of every man s conscience in the enjoyment of it . And although among our blessings we can not number an exemption from the evils of war , yet these will never be regarded as the greatest of evils by the friends of liberty and of the rights of nations . Our country has before preferred them to the degraded condition which was the alternative when the sword was drawn in the cause which gave birth to our national independence , and none who contemplate the magnitude and feel the value of that glorious event will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which it placed the American people . With all good citizens the justice and necessity of resisting wrongs and usurpations no longer to be borne will sufficiently outweigh the privations and sacrifices inseparable from a state of war . But it is a reflection , moreover , peculiarly consoling , that , whilst wars are generally aggravated by their baneful effects on the internal improvements and permanent prosperity of the nations engaged in them , such is the favored situation of the United States that the calamities of the contest into which they have been compelled to enter are mitigated by improvements and advantages of which the contest itself is the source . If the war has increased the interruptions of our commerce , it has at the same time cherished and multiplied our manufactures so as to make us independent of all other countries for the more essential branches for which we ought to be dependent on none , and is even rapidly giving them an extent which will create additional staples in our future intercourse with foreign markets . If much treasure has been expended , no inconsiderable portion of it has been applied to objects durable in their value and necessary to our permanent safety . If the war has exposed us to increased spoliations on the ocean and to predatory incursions on the land , it has developed the national means of retaliating the former and of providing protection against the latter , demonstrating to all that every blow aimed at our maritime independence is an impulse accelerating the growth of our maritime power . By diffusing through the mass of the nation the elements of military discipline and instruction by augmenting and distributing warlike preparations applicable to future use by evincing the zeal and valor with which they will be employed and the cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will be borne , a greater respect for our rights and a longer duration of our future peace are promised than could be expected without these proofs of the national character and resources . The war has proved moreover that our free Government , like other free governments , though slow in its early movements , acquires in its progress a force proportioned to its freedom , and that the union of these States , the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each , is strengthened by every occasion that puts it to the test . In fine , the war , with all its vicissitudes , is illustrating the capacity and the destiny of the United States to be a great , a flourishing , and a powerful nation , worthy of the friendship which it is disposed to cultivate with all others , and authorized by its own example to require from all an observance of the laws of justice and reciprocity . Beyond these their claims have never extended , and in contending for these we behold a subject for our congratulations in the daily testimonies of increasing harmony throughout the nation , and may humbly repose our trust in the smiles of Heaven on so righteous a cause .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States I communicate to Congress certain documents , being a continuation of those heretofore laid before them on the subject of our affairs with Great Britain . Without going back beyond the renewal in 1803 of the war in which Great Britain is engaged , and omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferior magnitude , the conduct of her government presents a series of acts hostile to the United States as an independent and neutral nation . British cruisers have been in the continued practice of violating the American flag on the great highway of nations , and of seizing and carrying off persons sailing under it , not in the exercise of a belligerent right founded on the law of nations against an enemy , but of a municipal prerogative over British subjects . British jurisdiction is thus extended to neutral vessels in a situation where no laws can operate but the law of nations and the laws of the country to which the vessels belong , and a self redress is assumed which , if British subjects were wrongfully detained and alone concerned , is that substitution of force for a resort to the responsible sovereign which falls within the definition of war . Could the seizure of British subjects in such cases be regarded as within the exercise of a belligerent right , the acknowledged laws of war , which forbid an article of captured property to be adjudged without a regular investigation before a competent tribunal , would imperiously demand the fairest trial where the sacred rights of persons were at issue . In place of such a trial these rights are subjected to the will of every petty commander . The practice , hence , is so far from affecting British subjects alone that , under the pretext of searching for these , thousands of American citizens , under the safeguard of public law and of their national flag , have been torn from their country and from everything dear to them have been dragged on board ships of war of a foreign nation and exposed , under the severities of their discipline , to be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes , to risk their lives in the battles of their oppressors , and to be the melancholy instruments of taking away those of their own brethren . Against this crying enormity , which Great Britain would be so prompt to avenge if committed against herself , the United States have in vain exhausted remonstrances and expostulations , and that no proof might be wanting of their conciliatory dispositions , and no pretext left for a continuance of the practice , the British government was formally assured of the readiness of the United States to enter into arrangements such as could not be rejected if the recovery of British subjects were the real and the sole object . The communication passed without effect . British cruisers have been in the practice also of violating the rights and the peace of our coasts . They hover over and harass our entering and departing commerce . To the most insulting pretensions they have added the most lawless proceedings in our very harbors , and have wantonly spilt American blood within the sanctuary of our territorial jurisdiction . The principles and rules enforced by that nation , when a neutral nation , against armed vessels of belligerents hovering near her coasts and disturbing her commerce are well known . When called on , nevertheless , by the United States to punish the greater offenses committed by her own vessels , her government has bestowed on their commanders additional marks of honor and confidence . Under pretended blockades , without the presence of an adequate force and sometimes without the practicability of applying one , our commerce has been plundered in every sea , the great staples of our country have been cut off from their legitimate markets , and a destructive blow aimed at our agricultural and maritime interests . In aggravation of these predatory measures they have been considered as in force from the dates of their notification , a retrospective effect being thus added , as has been done in other important cases , to the unlawfulness of the course pursued . And to render the outrage the more signal these mock blockades have been reiterated and enforced in the face of official communications from the British government declaring as the true definition of a legal blockade that particular ports must be actually invested and previous warning given to vessels bound to them not to enter . Not content with these occasional expedients for laying waste our neutral trade , the cabinet of Britain resorted at length to the sweeping system of blockades , under the name of orders in council , which has been molded and managed as might best suit its political views , its commercial jealousies , or the avidity of British cruisers . To our remonstrances against the complicated and transcendent injustice of this innovation the first reply was that the orders were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain as a necessary retaliation on decrees of her enemy proclaiming a general blockade of the British Isles at a time when the naval force of that enemy dared not issue from his own ports . She was reminded without effect that her own prior blockades , unsupported by an adequate naval force actually applied and continued , were a bar to this plea that executed edicts against millions of our property could not be retaliation on edicts confessedly impossible to be executed that retaliation , to be just , should fall on the party setting the guilty example , not on an innocent party which was not even chargeable with an acquiescence in it . When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our trade with her enemy by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with Great Britain , her cabinet , instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical discontinuance of its orders , formally avowed a determination to persist in them against the United States until the markets of her enemy should be laid open to British products , thus asserting an obligation on a neutral power to require one belligerent to encourage by its internal regulations the trade of another belligerent , contradicting her own practice toward all nations , in peace as well as in war , and betraying the insincerity of those professions which inculcated a belief that , having resorted to her orders with regret , she was anxious to find an occasion for putting an end to them . Abandoning still more all respect for the neutral rights of the United States and for its own consistency , the British government now demands as prerequisites to a repeal of its orders as they relate to the United States that a formality should be observed in the repeal of the French decrees nowise necessary to their termination nor exemplified by British usage , and that the French repeal , besides including that portion of the decrees which operates within a territorial jurisdiction , as well as that which operates on the high seas , against the commerce of the United States should not be a single and special repeal in relation to the United States , but should be extended to whatever other neutral nations unconnected with them may be affected by those decrees . And as an additional insult , they are called on for a formal disavowal of conditions and pretensions advanced by the French government for which the United States are so far from having made themselves responsible that , in official explanations which have been published to the world , and in a correspondence of the American minister at London with the British minister for foreign affairs such a responsibility was explicitly and emphatically disclaimed . It has become , indeed , sufficiently certain that the commerce of the United States is to be sacrificed , not as interfering with the belligerent rights of Great Britain not as supplying the wants of her enemies , which she herself supplies but as interfering with the monopoly which she covets for her own commerce and navigation . She carries on a war against the lawful commerce of a friend that she may the better carry on a commerce with an enemy a commerce polluted by the forgeries and perjuries which are for the most part the only passports by which it can succeed . Anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injured nations , the United States have withheld from Great Britain , under successive modifications , the benefits of a free intercourse with their market , the loss of which could not but outweigh the profits accruing from her restrictions of our commerce with other nations . And to entitle these experiments to the more favorable consideration they were so framed as to enable her to place her adversary under the exclusive operation of them . To these appeals her government has been equally inflexible , as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort rather than yield to the claims of justice or renounce the errors of a false pride . Nay , so far were the attempts carried to overcome the attachment of the British cabinet to its unjust edicts that it received every encouragement within the competency of the executive branch of our government to expect that a repeal of them would be followed by a war between the United States and France , unless the French edicts should also be repealed . Even this communication , although silencing forever the plea of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in those edicts originally the sole plea for them , received no attention . If no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British government against a repeal of its orders , it might be found in the correspondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London and the British secretary for foreign affairs in 1810 , on the question whether the blockade of May , 1806 , was considered as in force or as not in force . It had been ascertained that the French government , which urged this blockade as the ground of its Berlin decree , was willing in the event of its removal , to repeal that decree , which , being followed by alternate repeals of the other offensive edicts , might abolish the whole system on both sides . This inviting opportunity for accomplishing an object so important to the United States , and professed so often to be the desire of both the belligerents , was made known to the British government . As that government admits that an actual application of an adequate force is necessary to the existence of a legal blockade , and it was notorious that if such a force had ever been applied its long discontinuance had annulled the blockade in question , there could be no sufficient objection on the part of Great Britain to a formal revocation of it , and no imaginable objection to a declaration of the fact that the blockade did not exist . The declaration would have been consistent with her avowed principles of blockade , and would have enabled the United States to demand from France the pledged repeal of her decrees , either with success , in which case the way would have been opened for a general repeal of the belligerent edicts , or without success , in which case the United States would have been justified in turning their measures exclusively against France . The British government would , however , neither rescind the blockade nor declare its nonexistence , nor permit its non existence to be inferred and affirmed by the American plenipotentiary . On the contrary , by representing the blockade to be comprehended in the orders in council , the United States were compelled so to regard it in their subsequent proceedings . There was a period when a favorable change in the policy of the British cabinet was justly considered as established . The minister plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty here proposed an adjustment of the differences more immediately endangering the harmony of the two countries . The proposition was accepted with the promptitude and cordiality corresponding with the invariable professions of this government . A foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere and lasting reconciliation . The prospect , however , quickly vanished . The whole proceeding was disavowed by the British government without any explanations which could at that time repress the belief that the disavowal proceeded from a spirit of hostility to the commercial rights and prosperity of the United States and it has since come into proof that at the very moment when the public minister was holding the language of friendship and inspiring confidence in the sincerity of the negotiation with which he was charged a secret agent of his government was employed in intrigues having for their object a subversion of our government and a dismemberment of our happy union . In reviewing the conduct of Great Britain toward the United States our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare just renewed by the savages on one of our extensive frontiers a warfare which is known to spare neither age nor sex and to be distinguished by features peculiarly shocking to humanity . It is difficult to account for the activity and combinations which have for some time been developing themselves among tribes in constant intercourse with British traders and garrisons without connecting their hostility with that influence and without recollecting the authenticated examples of such interpositions heretofore furnished by the officers and agents of that government . Such is the spectacle of injuries and indignities which have been heaped on our country , and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and conciliatory efforts have not been able to avert . It might at least have been expected that an enlightened nation , if less urged by moral obligations or invited by friendly dispositions on the part of the United States , would have found its true interest alone a sufficient motive to respect their rights and their tranquillity on the high seas that an enlarged policy would have favored that free and general circulation of commerce in which the British nation is at all times interested , and which in times of war is the best alleviation of its calamities to herself as well as to other belligerents and more especially that the British cabinet would not , for the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile markets , have persevered in a course of measures which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable market of a great and growing country , disposed to cultivate the mutual advantages of an active commerce . Other counsels have prevailed . Our moderation and conciliation have had no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge pretensions . We behold our seafaring citizens still the daily victims of lawless violence , committed on the great common and highway of nations , even within sight of the country which owes them protection . We behold our vessels , freighted with the products of our soil and industry , or returning with the honest proceeds of them , wrested from their lawful destinations , confiscated by prize courts no longer the organs of public law but the instruments of arbitrary edicts , and their unfortunate crews dispersed and lost , or forced or inveigled in British ports into British fleets , whilst arguments are employed in support of these aggressions which have no foundation but in a principle equally supporting a claim to regulate our external commerce in all cases whatsoever . We behold , in fine , on the side of Great Britain , a state of war against the United States , and on the side of the United States a state of peace toward Great Britain . Whether the United States shall continue passive under these progressive usurpations and these accumulating wrongs , or , opposing force to force in defense of their national rights , shall commit a just cause into the hands of the Almighty Disposer of Events , avoiding all connections which might entangle it in the contest or views of other powers , and preserving a constant readiness to concur in an honorable re establishment of peace and friendship , is a solemn question which the Constitution wisely confides to the legislative department of the government . In recommending it to their early deliberations I am happy in the assurance that the decision will be worthy the enlightened and patriotic councils of a virtuous , a free , and a powerful nation . Having presented this view of the relations of the United States with Great Britain and of the solemn alternative grow mg out of them , I proceed to remark that the communica tions last made to Congress on the subject of our relations with France will have shewn that since the revocation of her decrees , as they violated the neutral rights of the United States , her government has authorized illegal captures by its privateers and public ships , and that other outrages have been practised on our vessels and our citizens It will have been seen also that no indemnity had been provided or satisfacto rily pledged for the extensive spoliations committed under the violent and retrospective orders of the French government against the property of our citizens seized within the jurisdic tion of France I abstain at this time from recommending to the consideration of Congress definitive measures with re spect to that nation , in the expectation that the result of un closed discussions between our minister plenipotentiary at Paris and the French government will speedily enable Congress to decide with greater advantage on the course due to the rights , the interests , and the honor of our country .<speech_sep>
