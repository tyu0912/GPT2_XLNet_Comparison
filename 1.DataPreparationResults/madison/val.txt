About to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me , I find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence and of the responsibility united with it . The impressions on me are strengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated , and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed . From the weight and magnitude now belonging to it I should be compelled to shrink if I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people , and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation , which forms so prominent a feature in our situation , is stamped with that justice which invites the smiles of Heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination . May we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the characters by which this war is distinguished It was not declared on the part of the United States until it had been long made on them , in reality though not in name until arguments and postulations had been exhausted until a positive declaration had been received that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued nor until this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down the spirit of the nation , destroying all confidence in itself and in its political institutions , and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe struggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers . On the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important class of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class . Not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection . I need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones , nor paint the outrages inseparable from it . The proofs are in the records of each successive Administration of our Government , and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the American people have found their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature . As the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects , we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor , no usage of civilized nations , no precept of courtesy or humanity , have been infringed . The war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations , and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed . How little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy They have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the United States not liable to be so considered under the usages of war . They have refused to consider as prisoners of war , and threatened to punish as traitors and deserters , persons emigrating without restraint to the United States , incorporated by naturalization into our political family , and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety . Such is the avowed purpose of a Government which is in the practice of naturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries , and not only of permitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native country . They have not , it is true , taken into their own hands the hatchet and the knife , devoted to indiscriminate massacre , but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments have allured them into their service , and carried them to battle by their sides , eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives . And , what was never before seen , British commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates . And now we find them , in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare , supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society , to dismember our confederated Republic . Happily , like others , these will recoil on the authors but they mark the degenerate counsels from which they emanate , and if they did not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as proceeding from a Government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary . To render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous , the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress . The sword was scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed . Still more precise advances were repeated , and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation . These resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue . Our nation is in number more than half that of the British Isles . It is composed of a brave , a free , a virtuous , and an intelligent people . Our country abounds in the necessaries , the arts , and the comforts of life . A general prosperity is visible in the public countenance . The means employed by the British cabinet to undermine it have recoiled on themselves have given to our national faculties a more rapid development , and , draining or diverting the precious metals from British circulation and British vaults , have poured them into those of the United States . It is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it . When the public voice called for war , all knew , and still know , that without them it could not be carried on through the period which it might last , and the patriotism , the good sense , and the manly spirit of our fellow citizens are pledges for the cheerfulness with which they will bear each his share of the common burden . To render the war short and its success sure , animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary , and the success of our arms now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to them . Already have the gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element . If the reputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other , presaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting to correspondent triumphs there also but the discipline and habits which are in daily progress .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives On this first occasion of meeting you it affords me much satisfaction to be able to communicate the commencement of a favorable change in our foreign relations , the critical state of which induced a session of Congress at this early period . In consequence of the provisions of the act interdicting commercial intercourse with Great Britain and France , our ministers at London and Paris were without delay instructed to let it be understood by the French and British Governments that the authority vested in the Executive to renew commercial intercourse with their respective nations would be exercised in the case specified by that act . Soon after these instructions were dispatched it was found that the British Government , anticipating from early proceedings of Congress at their last session the state of our laws , which has had the effect of placing the two belligerent powers on a footing of equal restrictions , and relying on the conciliatory disposition of the United States , had transmitted to their legation here provisional instructions not only to offer satisfaction for the attack on the frigate Chesapeake , and to make known the determination of His Britannic Majesty to send an envoy extraordinary with powers to conclude a treaty on all the points between the two countries , but , moreover , to signify his willingness in the meantime to withdraw his orders in council , in the persuasion that the intercourse with Great Britain would be renewed on the part of the United States . These steps of the British Government led to the correspondence and the proclamation now laid before you , by virtue of which the commerce between the two countries will be renewable after the 10th day of June next . Whilst I take pleasure in doing justice to the councils of His Britannic Majesty , which , no longer adhering to the policy which made an abandonment by France of her decrees a prerequisite to a revocation of the British orders , have substituted the amicable course which has issued thus happily , I can not do less than refer to the proposal heretofore made on the part of the United States , embracing a like restoration of the suspended commerce , as a proof of the spirit of accommodation which at no time been intermitted , and to the result which now calls for our congratulations , as corroborating the principles by which the public councils have been guided during a period of the most trying embarrassments . The discontinuance of the British orders as they respect the United States having been thus arranged , a communication of the event has been forwarded in one of our public vessels to our minister plenipotentiary at Paris , with instructions to avail himself of the important addition thereby made to the considerations which press on the justice of the French Government a revocation of its decrees or such a modification of them as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States . The revision of our commercial laws proper to adapt them to the arrangement which has taken place with Great Britain will doubtless engage the early attention of Congress . It will be worthy at the same time of their lust and provident care to make such further alterations in the laws as will more especially protect and foster the several branches of manufacture which have been recently instituted or extended by the laudable exertions of our citizens . Under the existing aspect of our affairs I have thought it not inconsistent with a just precaution to have the gunboats , with the exception of those at New Orleans , placed in a situation incurring no expense beyond that requisite for their preservation and conveniency for future service , and to have the crews of those at New Orleans reduced to the number required for their navigation and safety . I have thought also that our citizens detached in quotas of militia amounting to 100 , 000 under the act of March , 1808 , might not improperly be relieved from the state in which they were held for immediate service . A discharge of them has been accordingly directed . The progress made in raising and organizing the additional military force , for which provision was made by the act of April , 1808 , together with the disposition of the troops , will appear by a report which the Secretary of War is preparing , and which will be laid before you . Of the additional frigates required by an act of the last session to be fitted for actual service , two are in readiness , one nearly so , and the fourth is expected to be ready in the month of July . A report which the Secretary of the Navy is preparing on the subject , to be laid before Congress , will shew at the same time the progress made in officering and manning these ships . It will shew also the degree in which the provisions of the act relating to the other public armed ships have been carried into execution . It will rest with the judgment of Congress to decide how far the change in our external prospects may authorize any modifications of the laws relating to the army and navy establishments . The works of defense for our seaport towns and harbors have proceeded with as much activity as the season of the year and other circumstances would admit . It is necessary , however , to state that , the appropriations hitherto made being found to be deficient , a further provision will claim the early consideration of Congress . The whole of the 8 per cent stock remaining due by the United States , amounting to 5 , 300 , 000 , had been reimbursed on the last day of the year 1808 and on the 1st day of April last the sum in the Treasury exceeded 9 , 500 , 000 . This , together with the receipts of the current year on account of former revenue bonds , will probably be nearly if not altogether sufficient to defray the expenses of the year . But the suspension of exports and the consequent decrease of importations during the last twelve months will necessarily cause a great diminution in the receipts of the year 1810 . After that year , should our foreign relations be undisturbed , the revenue will again be more than commensurate to all the expenditures . Aware of the inconveniences of a protracted session at the present season of the year , I forbear to call the attention of the Legislature to any matters not particularly urgent . It remains , therefore , only to assure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which I shall cooperate for the welfare and happiness of our country , and to pray that it may experience a continuance of the divine blessings by which it has been so signally favored . JAMES MADISON .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives In reviewing the present state of our country , our attention cannot be withheld from the effect produced by peculiar seasons which have very generally impaired the annual gifts of the earth and threatened scarcity in particular districts . Such , however , is the variety of soils , of climates , and of products within our extensive limits that the aggregate resources for subsistence are more than sufficient for the aggregate wants . And as far as an economy of consumption , more than usual , may be necessary , our thankfulness is due to Providence for what is far more than a compensation , in the remarkable health which has distinguished the present year . Amidst the advantages which have succeeded the peace of Europe , and that of the United States with Great Britain , in a general invigoration of industry among us and in the extension of our commerce , the value of which is more and more disclosing itself to commercial nations , it is to be regretted that a depression is experienced by particular branches of our manufactures and by a portion of our navigation . As the first proceeds in an essential degree from an excess of imported merchandise , which carries a check in its own tendency , the cause in its present extent can not be very long in duration . The evil will not , however , be viewed by Congress without a recollection that manufacturing establishments , if suffered to sink too low or languish too long , may not revive after the causes shall have ceased , and that in the vicissitudes of human affairs situations may recur in which a dependence on foreign sources for indispensable supplies may be among the most serious embarrassments . The depressed state of our navigation is to be ascribed in a material degree to its exclusion from the colonial ports of the nation most extensively connected with us in commerce , and from the indirect operation of that exclusion . Previous to the late convention at London between the United States and Great Britain the relative state of the navigation laws of the two countries , growing out of the treaty of 1794 , had given to the British navigation a material advantage over the American in the intercourse between the American ports and British ports in Europe . The convention of London equalized the laws of the two countries relating to those ports , leaving the intercourse between our ports and the ports of the British colonies subject , as before , to the respective regulations of the parties . The British Government enforcing now regulations which prohibit a trade between its colonies and the United States in American vessels , whilst they permit a trade in British vessels , the American navigation loses accordingly , and the loss is augmented by the advantage which is given to the British competition over the American in the navigation between our ports and British ports in Europe by the circuitous voyages enjoyed by the one and not enjoyed by the other . The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity applied to one branch of the commercial intercourse has been pressed on our part as equally applicable to both branches but it is ascertained that the British cabinet declines all negotiation on the subject , with a disavowal , however , of any disposition to view in an unfriendly light whatever countervailing regulations the United States may oppose to the regulations of which they complain . The wisdom of the Legislature will decide on the course which , under these circumstances , is prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable relations between the two nations and to the just interests of the United States . I have the satisfaction to state , generally , that we remain in amity with foreign powers . An occurrence has indeed taken place in the Gulf of Mexico which , if sanctioned by the Spanish Government , may make an exception as to that power . According to the report of our naval commander on that station , one of our public armed vessels was attacked by an over powering force under a Spanish commander , and the American flag , with the officers and crew , insulted in a manner calling for prompt reparation . This has been demanded . In the mean time a frigate and a smaller vessel of war have been ordered into that Gulf for the protection of our commerce . It would be improper to omit that the representative of His Catholic Majesty in the United States lost no time in giving the strongest assurances that no hostile order could have emanated from his Government , and that it will be as ready to do as to expect whatever the nature of the case and the friendly relations of the two countries shall be found to require . The posture of our affairs with Algiers at the present moment is not known . The Day , drawing pretexts from circumstances for which the United States were not answerable , addressed a letter to this Government declaring the treaty last concluded with him to have been annulled by our violation of it , and presenting as the alternative war or a renewal of the former treaty , which stipulated , among other things , an annual tribute . The answer , with an explicit declaration that the United States preferred war to tribute , required his recognition and observance of the treaty last made , which abolishes tribute and the slavery of our captured citizens . The result of the answer has not been received . Should he renew his warfare on our commerce , we rely on the protection it will find in our naval force actually in the Mediterranean . With the other Barbary States our affairs have undergone no change . The Indian tribes within our limits appear also disposed to remain at peace . From several of them purchases of lands have been made particularly favorable to the wishes and security of our frontier settlements , as well as to the general interests of the nation . In some instances the titles , though not supported by due proof , and clashing those of one tribe with the claims of another , have been extinguished by double purchases , the benevolent policy of the United States preferring the augmented expense to the hazard of doing injustice or to the enforcement of justice against a feeble and untutored people by means involving or threatening an effusion of blood . I am happy to ad that the tranquillity which has been restored among the tribes themselves , as well as between them and our own population , will favor the resumption of the work of civilization which had made an encouraging progress among some tribes , and that the facility is increasing for extending that divided and individual ownership , which exists now in movable property only , to the soil itself , and of thus establishing in the culture and improvement of it the true foundation for a transit from the habits of the savage to the arts and comforts of social life . As a subject of the highest importance to the national welfare , I must again earnestly recommend to the consideration of Congress a reorganization of the militia on a plan which will form it into classes according to the periods of life more or less adapted to military services . An efficient militia is authorized and contemplated by the Constitution and required by the spirit and safety of free government . The present organization of our militia is universally regarded as less efficient than it ought to be made , and no organization can be better calculated to give to it its due force than a classification which will assign the foremost place in the defense of the country to that portion of its citizens whose activity and animation best enable them to rally to its standard . Besides the consideration that a time of peace is the time when the change can be made with most convenience and equity , it will now be aided by the experience of a recent war in which the militia bore so interesting a part . Congress will call to mind that no adequate provision has yet been made for the uniformity of weights and measures also contemplated by the Constitution . The great utility of a standard fixed in its nature and founded on the easy rule of decimal proportions is sufficiently obvious . It led the Government at an early stage to preparatory steps for introducing it , and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public gratitude . The importance which I have attached to the establishment of a university within this District on a scale and for objects worthy of the American nation induces me to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable consideration of Congress . And I particularly invite again their attention to the expediency of exercising their existing powers , and , where necessary , of resorting to the prescribed mode of enlarging them , in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of roads and canals , such as will have the effect of drawing more closely together every part of our country by promoting intercourse and improvements and by increasing the share of every part in the common stock of national prosperity . Occurrences having taken place which shew that the statutory provisions for the dispensation of criminal justice are deficient in relation both to places and to persons under the exclusive cognizance of the national authority , an amendment of the law embracing such cases will merit the earliest attention of the Legislature . It will be a seasonable occasion also for inquiring how far legislative interposition may be further requisite in providing penalties for offenses designated in the Constitution or in the statutes , and to which either no penalties are annexed or none with sufficient certainty . And I submit to the wisdom of Congress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not expedient for the purpose of mitigating in certain cases penalties which were adopted into it antecedent to experiment and examples which justify and recommend a more lenient policy . The United States , having been the first to abolish within the extent of their authority the transportation of the natives of Africa into slavery , by prohibiting the introduction of slaves and by punishing their citizens participating in the traffic , can not but be gratified at the progress made by concurrent efforts of other nations toward a general suppression of so great an evil . They must feel at the same time the greater solicitude to give the fullest efficacy to their own regulations . With that view , the interposition of Congress appears to be required by the violations and evasions which it is suggested are chargeable on unworthy citizens who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flags and with foreign ports , and by collusive importations of slaves into the United States through adjoining ports and territories . I present the subject to Congress with a full assurance of their disposition to apply all the remedy which can be afforded by an amendment of the law . The regulations which were intended to guard against abuses of a kindred character in the trade between the several States ought also to be rendered more effectual for their humane object . To these recommendations I add , for the consideration of Congress , the expediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment , and of an additional department in the executive branch of the Government . The first is called for by the accruing business which necessarily swells the duties of the Federal courts , and by the great and widening space within which justice is to be dispensed by them . The time seems to have arrived which claims for members of the Supreme Court a relief from itinerary fatigues , incompatible as well with the age which a portion of them will always have attained as with the researches and preparations which are due to their stations and to the juridical reputation of their country . And considerations equally cogent require a more convenient organization of the subordinate tribunals , which may be accomplished without an objectionable increase of the number or expense of the judges . The extent and variety of executive business also accumulating with the progress of our country and its growing population call for an additional department , to be charged with duties now over burdening other departments and with such as have not been annexed to any department . The course of experience recommends , as another improvement in the executive establishment , that the provision for the station of Attorney General , whose residence at the seat of Government , official connections with it , and the management of the public business before the judiciary preclude an extensive participation in professional emoluments , be made more adequate to his services and his relinquishments , and that , with a view to his reasonable accommodation and to a proper depository of his official opinions and proceedings , there be included in the provision the usual appurtenances to a public office . In directing the legislative attention to the state of the finances it is a subject of great gratification to find that even within the short period which has elapsed since the return of peace the revenue has far exceeded all the current demands upon the Treasury , and that under any probable diminution of its future annual products which the vicissitudes of commerce may occasion it will afford an ample fund for the effectual and early extinguishment of the public debt . It has been estimated that during the year 1816 the actual receipts of revenue at the Treasury , including the balance at the commencement of the year , and excluding the proceeds of loans and Treasury notes , will amount to about the sum of 47 , 000 , 000 that during the same year the actual payments at the Treasury , including the payment of the arrearages of the War Department as well as the payment of a considerable excess beyond the annual appropriations , will amount to about the sum of 38and that consequently at the close of the year there will be a surplus in the Treasury of about the sum of 9The operations of the Treasury continued to be obstructed by difficulties arising from the condition of the national currency , but they have nevertheless been effectual to a beneficial extent in the reduction of the public debt and the establishment of the public credit . The floating debt of Treasury notes and temporary loans will soon be entirely discharged . The aggregate of the funded debt , composed of debts incurred during the wars of 1776 and 1812 , has been estimated with reference to the first of January next at a sum not exceeding 110The ordinary annual expenses of the Government for the maintenance of all its institutions , civil , military , and naval , have been estimated at a sum of 20and the permanent revenue to be derived from all the existing sources has been estimated at a sum of 25Upon this general view of the subject it is obvious that there is only wanting to the fiscal prosperity of the Government the restoration of an uniform medium of exchange . The resources and the faith of the nation , displayed in the system which Congress has established , insure respect and confidence both at home and abroad . The local accumulations of the revenue have already enabled the Treasury to meet the public engagements in the local currency of most of the States , and it is expected that the same cause will produce the same effect throughout the Union but for the interests of the community at large , as well as for the purposes of the Treasury , it is essential that the nation should possess a currency of equal value , credit , and use wherever it may circulate . The Constitution has intrusted Congress exclusively with the power of creating and regulating a currency of that description , and the measures which were taken during the last session in execution of the power give every promise of success . The Bank of the United States has been organized under auspices the most favorable , and can not fail to be an important auxiliary to those measures . For a more enlarged view of the public finances , with a view of the measures pursued by the Treasury Department previous to the resignation of the late Secretary , I transmit an extract from the last report of that officer . Congress will perceive in it ample proofs of the solid foundation on which the financial prosperity of the nation rests , and will do justice to the distinguished ability and successful exertions with which the duties of the Department were executed during a period remarkable for its difficulties and its peculiar perplexities . The period of my retiring from the public service being at little distance , I shall find no occasion more proper than the present for expressing to my fellow citizens my deep sense of the continued confidence and kind support which I have received from them . My grateful recollection of these distinguished marks of their favorable regard can never cease , and with the consciousness that , if I have not served my country with greater ability , I have served it with a sincere devotion will accompany me as a source of unfailing gratification . Happily , I shall carry with me from the public theater other sources , which those who love their country most will best appreciate . I shall behold it blessed with tranquillity and prosperity at home and with peace and respect abroad . I can indulge the proud reflection that the American people have reached in safety and success their 40th year as an independent nation that for nearly an entire generation they have had experience of their present Constitution , the off spring of their undisturbed deliberations and of their free choice that they have found it to bear the trials of adverse as well as prosperous circumstances to contain in its combination of the federate and elective principles a reconcilement of public strength with individual liberty , of national power for the defense of national rights with a security against wars of injustice , of ambition , and vain glory in the fundamental provision which subjects all questions of war to the will of the nation itself , which is to pay its costs and feel its calamities . Nor is it less a peculiar felicity of this Constitution , so dear to us all , that it is found to be capable , without losing its vital energies , of expanding itself over a spacious territory with the increase and expansion of the community for whose benefit it was established . And may I not be allowed to add to this gratifying spectacle that I shall read in the character of the American people , in their devotion to true liberty and to the Constitution which is its palladium , sure presages that the destined career of my country will exhibit a Government pursuing the public good as its sole object , and regulating its means by the great principles consecrated in its charger and by those moral principles to which they are so well allied a Government which watches over the purity of elections , the freedom of speech and of the press , the trial by jury , and the equal interdict against encroachments and compacts between religion and the state which maintains inviolably the maxims of public faith , the security of persons and property , and encourages in every authorized mode the general diffusion of knowledge which guarantees to public liberty its permanency and to those who possess the blessing the true enjoyment of it a Government which avoids intrusions on the internal repose of other nations , and repels them from its own which does justice to all nations with a readiness equal to the firmness with which it requires justice from them and which , whilst it refines its domestic code from every ingredient not congenial with the precepts of an enlightened age and the sentiments of a virtuous people , seeks by appeals to reason and by its liberal examples to infuse into the law which governs the civilized world a spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamities of war , and meliorate the social and beneficent relations of peace a Government , in a word , whose conduct within and without may bespeak the most noble of ambitions that of promoting peace on earth and good will to man . These contemplations , sweetening the remnant of my days , will animate my prayers for the happiness of my beloved country , and a perpetuity of the institutions under which it is enjoyed .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate of the House of Representatives Notwithstanding the early day which had been fixed for your session of the present year , I was induced to call you together still sooner , as well that any inadequacy in the existing provisions for the wants of the Treasury might be supplied as that no delay might happen in providing for the result of the negotiations on foot with Great Britain , whether it should require arrangements adapted to a return of peace or further and more effective provisions for prosecuting the war . That result is not yet known . If , on the one hand , the repeal of the orders in council and the general pacification in Europe , which withdrew the occasion on which impressments from American vessels were practiced , suggest expectations that peace and amity may be reestablished , we are compelled , on the other hand , by the refusal of the British Government to accept the offered mediation of the Emperor of Russia , by the delays in giving effect to its own proposal of a direct negotiation , and , above all , by the principles and manner in which the war is now avowedly carried on to infer that a spirit of hostility is indulged more violent than ever against the rights and prosperity of this country . This increased violence is best explained by the two important circumstances that the great contest in Europe for an equilibrium guaranteeing all its States against the ambition of any has been closed without any check on the over bearing power of Great Britain on the ocean , and it has left in her hands disposable armaments , with which , forgetting the difficulties of a remote war with a free people , and yielding to the intoxication of success , with the example of a great victim to it before her eyes , she cherishes hopes of still further aggrandizing a power already formidable in its abuses to the tranquillity of the civilized and commercial world . But whatever may have inspired the enemy with these more violent purposes , the public councils of a nation more able to maintain than it was to require its independence , and with a devotion to it rendered more ardently by the experience of its blessings , can never deliberate but on the means most effectual for defeating the extravagant views or unwarrantable passions with which alone the war can now be pursued against us . In the events of the present campaign the enemy , with all his augmented means and wanton use of them , has little ground for exultation , unless he can feel it in the success of his recent enterprises against this metropolis and the neighboring town of Alexandria , from both of which his retreats were as precipitate as his attempts were bold and fortunate . In his other incursions on our Atlantic frontier his progress , often checked and chastised by the martial spirit of the neighboring citizens , has had more effect in distressing individuals and in dishonoring his arms than in promoting any object of legitimate warfare and in the two instances mentioned , however deeply to be regretted on our part , he will find in his transient success , which interrupted for a moment only the ordinary business at the seat of Government , no compensation for the loss of character with the world by his violations of private property and by his destruction of public edifices protected as monuments of the arts by the laws of civilized warfare . On our side we can appeal to a series of achievements which have given new luster to the American arms . Besides the brilliant incidents in the minor operations of the campaign , the splendid victories gained on the Canadian side of the Niagara by the American forces under Major General Brown and Brigadiers Scott and Gaines have gained for these heroes and their emulating companions the most unfading laurels , and , having triumphantly tested the progressive discipline of the American soldiery , have taught the enemy that the longer he protracts his hostile efforts the more certain and decisive will be his final discomfiture . On our southern border victory has continued also to follow the American standard . The bold and skillful operations of Major General Jackson , conducting troops drawn from the militia of the States least distant , particularly Tennessee , have subdued the principal tribes of hostile savages , and , by establishing a peace with them , preceded by recent and exemplary chastisement , has best guarded against the mischief of their cooperations with the British enterprises which may be planned against that quarter of our country . Important tribes of Indians on our northwestern frontier have also acceded to stipulations which bind them to the interests of the United States and to consider our enemy as theirs also . In the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of Baltimore , defended by militia and volunteers , aided by a small body of regulars and sea men , he was received with a spirit which produced a rapid retreat to his ships , whilst concurrent attack by a large fleet was successfully resisted by the steady and well directed fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it . In another recent attack by a powerful force on our troops at Plattsburg , of which regulars made a part only , the enemy , after a perseverance for many hours , was finally compelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat , with our gallant bands pressing upon them . On the Lakes , so much contested throughout the war , the great exertions for the command made on our part have been well repaid . On Lake Ontario our squadron is now and has been for some time in a condition to confine that of the enemy to his own port , and to favor the operations of our land forces on that frontier . A part of the squadron on Lake Erie has been extended into Lake Huron , and has produced the advantage of displaying our command on that lake also . One object of the expedition was the reduction of Mackinaw , which filed with the loss of a few brave men , among whom was an officer justly distinguished for his gallant exploits . The expedition , ably conducted by both the land and the naval commanders , was otherwise highly valuable in its effects . On Lake Champlain , where our superiority had for some time been undisputed , the British squadron lately came into action with the American , commanded by Captain Macdonough . It issued in the capture of the whole of the enemy s ships . The best praise for this officer and his intrepid comrades is in the likeness of his triumph to the illustrious victory which immortalized another officer and established at a critical moment our command of another lake . On the ocean the pride of our naval arms had been amply supported . A second frigate has indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy , but the loss is hidden in the blaze of heroism with which she was defended . Captain Porter , who commanded her , and whose previous career had been distinguished by daring enterprise and by fertility of genius , maintained a sanguinary contest against two ships , one of them superior to his own , and under other severe disadvantages , til humanity tore down the colors which valor had nailed to the mast . This officer and his brave comrades have added much to the rising glory of the American flag , and have merited all the effusions of gratitude which their country is ever ready to bestow on the champions of its rights and of its safety . Two smaller vessels of war have also become prizes to the enemy , but by a superiority of force which sufficiently vindicates the reputation of their commanders , whilst two others , one commanded by Captain Warrington , the other by Captain Blakely , have captured British ships of the same class with a gallantry and good conduct which entitle them and their companions to a just share in the praise of their country . In spite of the naval force of the enemy accumulated on our coasts , our private cruisers also have not ceased to annoy his commerce and to bring their rich prizes into our ports , contributing thus , with other proofs , to demonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a blockade the proclamation of which is made the pretext for vexing and discouraging the commerce of neutral powers with the United States . To meet the extended and diversified warfare adopted by the enemy , great bodies of militia have been taken into service for the public defense , and great expenses incurred . That the defense everywhere may be both more convenient and more economical , Congress will see the necessity of immediate measures for filling the ranks of the Regular Army and of enlarging the provision for special corps , mounted and unmounted , to be engaged for longer periods of service than are due from the militia . I earnestly renew , at the same time , a recommendation of such changes in the system of the militia as , by classing and disciplining for the most prompt and active service the portions most capable of it , will give to that great resource for the public safety all the requisite energy and efficiency . The moneys received into the Treasury during the nine months ending on the 30th day of June last amounted to 32of which near 11M were the proceeds of the public revenue and the remainder derived from loans . The disbursements for public expenditures during the same period exceeded 34and left in the Treasury on the first day of July near 5The demands during the remainder of the present year already authorized by Congress and the expenses incident to an extension of the operations of the war will render it necessary that large sums should be provided to meet them . From this view of the national affairs Congress will be urged to take up without delay as well the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of military force , and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the character which the war has assumed . It is not to be disguised that the situation of our country calls for its greatest efforts . Our enemy is powerful in men and in money , on the land and on the water . Availing himself of fortuitous advantages , he is aiming with his undivided force a deadly blow at our growing prosperity , perhaps at our national existence . He has avowed his purpose of trampling on the usages of civilized warfare , and given earnests of it in the plunder and wanton destruction of private property . In his pride of maritime dominion and in his thirst of commercial monopoly he strikes with peculiar animosity at the progress of our navigation and of our manufactures . His barbarous policy has not even spared those monuments of the arts and models of taste with which our country had enriched and embellished its infant metropolis . From such an adversary hostility in its greatest force and in its worst forms may be looked for . The American people will face it with the undaunted spirit which in their revolutionary struggle defeated his unrighteous projects . His threats and his barbarities , instead of dismay , will kindle in every bosom an indignation not be extinguished but in the disaster and expulsion of such cruel invaders . In providing the means necessary the National Legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlightened patriotism of its constituents . They will cheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind which the safety and honor of the nation demand . We have seen them everywhere paying their taxes , direct and indirect , with the greatest promptness and alacrity . We see them rushing with enthusiasm to the scenes where danger and duty call . In offering their blood they give the surest pledge that no other tribute will be withheld . Having forborne to declare war until to other aggressions had been added the capture of near 1000 American vessels and the impressment of thousands of American sea faring citizens , and until a final declaration had been made by the Government of Great Britain that her hostile orders against our commerce would not be revoked but on conditions as impossible as unjust , whilst it was known that these orders would not otherwise cease but with a war which had lasted nearly twenty years , and which , according to appearances at that time , might last as many more having manifested on every occasion and in every proper mode a sincere desire to arrest the effusion of blood and meet our enemy on the ground of justice and reconciliation , our beloved country , in still opposing to his persevering hostility all its energies , with an undiminished disposition toward peace and friendship on honorable terms , must carry with it the good wishes of the impartial world and the best hopes of support from an omnipotent and kind Providence .<speech_sep>Whereas the enemy by a sudden incursion have succeeded in invading the capital of the nation , defended at the moment by troops less numerous than their own and almost entirely of the militia , during their possession of which , though for a single day only , they wantonly destroyed the public edifices , having no relation in their structure to operations of war nor used at the time for military annoyance , some of these edifices being also costly monuments of taste and of the arts , and others depositories of the public archives , not only precious to the nation as the memorials of its origin and its early transactions , but interesting to all nations as contributions to the general stock of historical instruction and political science andWhereas advantage has been taken of the loss of a fort more immediately guarding the neighboring town of Alexandria to place the town within the range of a naval force too long and too much in the habit of abusing its superiority wherever it can be applied to require as the alternative of a general conflagration an undisturbed plunder of private property , which has been executed in a manner peculiarly distressing to the inhabitants , who had inconsiderately cast themselves upon the justice and generosity of the victor andWhereas it now appears by a direct communication from the British commander on the American station to be his avowed purpose to employ the force under his direction in destroying and laying waste such towns and districts upon the coast as may be found assailable , adding to this declaration the insulting pretext that it is in retaliation for a wanton destruction committed by the army of the United States in Upper Canada , when it is notorious that no destruction has been committed , which , notwithstanding the multiplied outrages previously committed by the enemy was not unauthorized , and promptly shown to be so , and that the United States have been as constant in their endeavors to reclaim the enemy from such outrages by the contrast of their own example as they have been ready to terminate on reasonable conditions the war itself andWhereas these proceedings and declared purposes , which exhibit a deliberate disregard of the principles of humanity and the rules of civilized warfare , and which must give to the existing war a character of extended devastation and barbarism at the very moment of negotiations for peace , invited by the enemy himself , leave no prospect of safety to anything within the reach of his predatory and incendiary operations but in manful and universal determination to chastise and expel the invader Now , therefore , James Madison . President of the United States , do issue this my proclamation , exhorting all the good people thereof to unite their hearts and hands in giving effect to the ample means possessed for that purpose . I enjoin it on all officers , civil and military , to exert themselves in executing the duties with which they are respectively charged and more especially I require the officers commanding the respective military districts to be vigilant and alert in providing for the defense thereof , for the more effectual accomplishment of which they are authorized to call to the defense of exposed and threatened places portions of the militia most convenient thereto , whether they be or be not parts of the quotas detached for the service of the United States under requisitions of the General Government . On an occasion which appeals so forcibly to the proud feelings and patriotic devotion of the American people none will forget what they owe to themselves , what they owe to their country and the high destinies which await it , what to the glory acquired by their fathers in establishing the independence which is now to be maintained by their sons with the augmented strength and resources with which time and Heaven had blessed them . In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents . Done at the city of Washington , the 1st day of September , 1814 , and of the Independence of the United States the thirty ninth . JAMES MADISOBy the President JAMES MONROE , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>Whereas the Congress of the United States , by a joint resolution of the two Houses , have signified a request that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity as a day of public humiliation and prayer and Whereas in times of public calamity such as that of the war brought on the United States by the injustice of a foreign government it is especially becoming that the hearts of all should be touched with the same and the eyes of all be turned to that Almighty Power in whose hand are the welfare and the destiny of nations I do therefore issue this my proclamation , recommending to all who shall be piously disposed to unite their hearts and voices in addressing at one and the same time their vows and adorations to the Great Parent and Sovereign of the Universe that they assemble on the second Thursday of September next in their respective religious congregations to render Him thanks for the many blessings He has bestowed on the people of the United States that He has blessed them with a land capable of yielding all the necessaries and requisites of human life , with ample means for convenient exchanges with foreign countries that He has blessed the labors employed in its cultivation and improvement that He is now blessing the exertions to extend and establish the arts and manufactures which will secure within ourselves supplies too important to remain dependent on the precarious policy or the peaceable dispositions of other nations , and particularly that He has blessed the United States with a political Constitution rounded on the will and authority of the whole people and guaranteeing to each individual security , not only of his person and his property , but of those sacred rights of conscience so essential to his present happiness and so dear to his future hopes that with those expressions of devout thankfulness be joined supplications to the same Almighty Power that He would look down with compassion on our infirmities that He would pardon our manifold transgressions and awaken and strengthen in all the wholesome purposes of repentance and amendment that in this season of trial and calamity He would preside in a particular manner over our public councils and inspire all citizens with a love of their country and with those fraternal affections and that mutual confidence which have so happy a tendency to make us safe at home and respected abroad and that as He was graciously pleased heretofore to smile on our struggles against the attempts of the Government of the Empire of which these States then made a part to wrest from them the rights and privileges to which they were entitled in common with every other part and to raise them to the station of an independent and sovereign people , so He would now be pleased in like manner to bestow His blessing on our arms in resisting the hostile and persevering efforts of the same power to degrade us on the ocean , the common inheritance of all , from rights and immunities belonging and essential to the American people as a coequal member of the great community of independent nations and that , inspiring our enemies with moderation , with justice , and with that spirit of reasonable accommodation which our country has continued to manifest , we may be enabled to beat our swords into plowshares and to enjoy in peace every man the fruits of his honest industry and the rewards of his lawful enterprise . If the public homage of a people can ever be worthy the favorable regard of the Holy and Omniscient Being to whom it is addressed , it must be that in which those who join in it are guided only by their free choice , by the impulse of their hearts and the dictates of their consciences and such a spectacle must be interesting to all Christian nations as proving that religion , that gift of Heaven for the good of man , freed from all coercive edicts , from that unhallowed connection with the powers of this world which corrupts religion into an instrument or an usurper of the policy of the state , and making no appeal but to reason , to the heart , and to the conscience , can spread its benign influence everywhere and can attract to the divine altar those freewill offerings of humble supplication , thanksgiving , and praise which alone can be acceptable to Him whom no hypocrisy can deceive and no forced sacrifices propitiate . Upon these principles and with these views the good people of the United States are invited , in conformity with the resolution aforesaid , to dedicate the day above named to the religious solemnities therein recommended . Given at Washington , this 23d day of July , 1813 . JAMES MADISON .<speech_sep>
