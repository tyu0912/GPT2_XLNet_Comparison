My Fellow Americans Once upon a time , a few years ago , there was a city in our Middle West which was threatened by a destructive flood in the great river . The waters had risen to the top of the banks . Every man , woman and child in that city was called upon to fill sand bags in order to defend their homes against the rising waters . For many days and nights , destruction and death stared them in the face . As a result of the grim , determined community effort , that city still stands . Those people kept the levees above the peak of the flood . All of them joined together in the desperate job that which had to be done business men , workers , farmers , and doctors , and preachers people of all races . To me , that town is a living symbol of what community cooperation can accomplish . Today , in the same kind of community effort , only very much larger , the United Nations and their peoples have kept the levees of civilization high enough to prevent the floods of aggression and barbarism and wholesale murder from engulfing us all . The flood has been raging for four years . At last we are beginning to gain on it but the waters have not yet receded enough for us to relax our sweating work with the sand bags . In this war bond campaign we are filling bags and placing them against the flood bags which are essential if we are to stand off the ugly torrent which is trying to sweep us all away . Today , it is announced that an armistice with Italy has been concluded . This was a great victory for the United Nations but it was also a great victory for the Italian people . After years of war and suffering and degradation , the Italian people are at last coming to the day of liberation from their real enemies , the Nazis . But let us not delude ourselves that this armistice means the end of the war in the Mediterranean . We still have to must drive the Germans out of Italy as we have driven them out of Tunisia and Sicily we must drive them out of France and all other captive countries and we must strike them on their own soil from all directions . Our ultimate objectives in this war continue to be Berlin and Tokyo . I ask you to bear these objectives constantly in mind and do not forget that we still have a long way to go before we attain attaining them . The great news that you have heard today from General Eisenhower does not give you license to settle back in your rocking chairs and say , Well , that does it . We have got them em on the run . Now we can start the celebration . The time for celebration is not yet . And I have a suspicion that when this war does end , we shall not be in a very celebrating mood , a very celebrating frame of mind . I think that our main emotion will be one of grim determination that this shall not happen again . During the past weeks , Churchill and I have been in constant conference with the leaders of our combined fighting forces . We have been in constant communication with our fighting Allies , Russian and Chinese , who are prosecuting the war with relentless determination and with conspicuous success on far distant fronts . And Churchill he and I are here together in Washington here at this crucial moment . We have seen the satisfactory fulfillment of plans that were made in Casablanca last January and here in Washington last May . And lately we have made new , well considered extensive plans for the future . But throughout these conferences we have never lost sight of the fact that this war will become bigger and tougher , rather than easier , during the long months that are to come . This war does not and must not stop for one single instant . Your our fighting men know that . Those of them who are moving forward through jungles against lurking Japs those who are in landing at this moment , in barges moving through the dawn up to strange enemy coasts those who are diving their bombers down on the targets at roof top level at this moment every one of these men knows that this war is a full time job and that it will continue to be that until total victory is won . And , by the same token , every responsible leader in all the United Nations knows that the fighting goes on twenty four hours a day , seven days a week , and that any day lost may have to be paid for in terms of months added to the duration of the war . Every campaign , every single operation in all the campaigns that we plan and carry through must be figured in terms of staggering material costs . We cannot afford to be niggardly with any of our resources , for we shall need all of them to do the job that we have put our undertaken shoulder to . Your fellow Americans have given a magnificent account of themselves on the battlefields and on the oceans and in the skies all over the world . Now it is up to you to prove to them that you are contributing your share and more than your share . It is not sufficient to simply to put money into War Bonds money which we would normally save . We must put money into War Bonds money which we would not normally save . Only then have we done everything that good conscience demands . So it is up to you up to you , the Americans in the American homes the very homes which our sons and daughters are working and fighting and dying to preserve . I know I speak for every man and woman throughout the Americas when I say that we Americans will not be satisfied to send our troops into the fire of the enemy with equipment inferior in any way . Nor will we be satisfied to send our troops with equipment only equal to that of the enemy . We are determined to provide our troops with overpowering superiority superiority of quantity quality and quality quantity in any and every category of arms and armaments that they may conceivably need . And where does this our dominating power come from Why , it can come only from you . The money you lend and the money you give in taxes buys that death dealing , and at the same time life saving power that we need for victory . This is an expensive war expensive in money you can help it you can help to keep it at a minimum cost in lives . The American people will never stop to reckon the cost of redeeming civilization . They know there never can be any economic justification for failing to save freedom . And we can be sure that our enemies will watch this drive with the keenest interest . They know that success in this undertaking will shorten the war . They know that the more money the American people lend to their Government , the more powerful and relentless will be the American forces in the field . They know that only a united and determined America could possibly produce on a voluntary basis so huge large a sum of money as fifteen billion dollars . The overwhelming success of the Second War Loan Drive last April showed that the people of this Democracy stood firm behind their troops . This The Third War Loan , which we are starting tonight , will also succeed because the American people will not permit it to fail . I cannot tell you how much to invest in War Bonds during this Third War Loan Drive . No one can tell you . It is for you to decide under the guidance of your own conscience . I will say this , however . Because the Nation s needs are greater than ever before , our sacrifices too must be greater than they have ever been before . Nobody knows when total victory will come but we do know that the harder we fight now , the more might and power we direct at the enemy now , the shorter the war will be and the smaller the sum total of sacrifice . Success of the Third War Loan will be the symbol that America does not propose to rest on its arms that we know the tough , bitter job ahead and will not stop until we have finished it . Now it is your turn Every dollar that you invest in the Third War Loan is your personal message of defiance to our common enemies to the ruthless savages militarists of Germany and Japan and it is your personal message of faith and good cheer to our Allies and to all the men at the front . God bless them<speech_sep>I am glad to come once again to Chicago and especially to have the opportunity of taking part in the dedication of this important project of civic betterment . On my trip across the continent and back I have been shown many evidences of the result of common sense cooperation between municipalities and the Federal Government , and I have been greeted by tens of thousands of Americans who have told me in every look and word that their material and spiritual well being has made great strides forward in the past few years . And yet , as I have seen with my own eyes , the prosperous farms , the thriving factories and the busy railroads , as I have seen the happiness and security and peace which covers our wide land , almost inevitably I have been compelled to contrast our peace with very different scenes being enacted in other parts of the world . It is because the people of the United States under modern conditions must , for the sake of their own future , give thought to the rest of the world , that as the responsible executive head of the Nation , have chosen this great inland city and this gala occasion to speak to you on a subject of definite national importance . The political situation in the world , which of late has been growing progressively worse , is such as to cause grave concern and anxiety to all the peoples and nations who wish to live in peace and amity with their neighbors . Some fifteen years ago the hopes of mankind for a continuing era of international peace were raised to great heights when more than sixty nations solemnly pledged themselves not to resort to arms in furtherance of their national aims and policies . The high aspirations expressed in the Briand Kellogg Peace Pact and the hopes for peace thus raised have of late given way to a haunting fear of calamity . The present reign of terror and international lawlessness began a few years ago . It began through unjustified interference in the internal affairs of other nations or the invasion of alien territory in violation of treaties and has now reached a stage where the very foundations of civilization are seriously threatened . The landmarks and traditions which have marked the progress of civilization toward a condition of law , order and justice are being wiped away . Without a declaration of war and without warning or justification of any kind , civilians , including vast numbers of women and children , are being ruthlessly murdered with bombs from the air . In times of so called peace , ships are being attacked and sunk by submarines without cause or notice . Nations are fomenting and taking sides in civil warfare in nations that have never done them any harm . Nations claiming freedom for themselves deny it to others . Innocent peoples , innocent nations , are being cruelly sacrificed to a greed for power and supremacy which is devoid of all sense of justice and humane considerations . To paraphrase a recent author perhaps we foresee a time when men , exultant in the technique of homicide , will rage so hotly over the world that every precious thing will be in danger , every book and picture and harmony , every treasure garnered through two millenniums , the small , the delicate , the defenseless all will be lost or wrecked or utterly destroyed . If those things come to pass in other parts of the world , let no one imagine that America will escape , that America may expect mercy , that this Western Hemisphere will not be attacked and that it will continue tranquilly and peacefully to carry on the ethics and the arts of civilization . If those days come there will be no safety by arms , no help from authority , no answer in science . The storm will rage till every flower of culture is trampled and all human beings are leveled in a vast chaos . If those days are not to come to pass if we are to have a world in which we can breathe freely and live in amity without fear the peace loving nations must make a concerted effort to uphold laws and principles on which alone peace can rest secure . The peace loving nations must make a concerted effort in opposition to those violations of treaties and those ignorings of humane instincts which today are creating a state of international anarchy and instability from which there is no escape through mere isolation or neutrality . Those who cherish their freedom and recognize and respect the equal right of their neighbors to be free and live in peace , must work together for the triumph of law and moral principles in order that peace , justice and confidence may prevail in the world . There must be a return to a belief in the pledged word , in the value of a signed treaty . There must be recognition of the fact that national morality is as vital as private morality . A bishop wrote me the other day It seems to me that something greatly needs to be said in behalf of ordinary humanity against the present practice of carrying the horrors of war to helpless civilians , especially women and children . It may be that such a protest might be regarded by many , who claim to be realists , as futile , but may it not be that the heart of mankind is so filled with horror at the present needless suffering that that force could be mobilized in sufficient volume to lessen such cruelty in the days ahead . Even though it may take twenty years , which God forbid , for civilization to make effective its corporate protest against this barbarism , surely strong voices may hasten the day . There is a solidarity and interdependence about the modern world , both technically and morally , which makes it impossible for any nation completely to isolate itself from economic and political upheavals in the rest of the world , especially when such upheavals appear to be spreading and not declining . There can be no stability or peace either within nations or between nations except under laws and moral standards adhered to by all International anarchy destroys every foundation for peace . It jeopardizes either the immediate or the future security of every nation , large or small . It is , therefore , a matter of vital interest and concern to the people of the United States that the sanctity of international treaties and the maintenance of international morality be restored . The overwhelming majority of the peoples and nations of the world today want to live in peace . They seek the removal of barriers against trade . They want to exert themselves in industry , in agriculture and in business , that they may increase their wealth through the production of wealth producing goods rather than striving to produce military planes and bombs and machine guns and cannon for the destruction of human lives and useful property . In those nations of the world which seem to be piling armament on armament for purposes of aggression , and those other nations which fear acts of aggression against them and their security , a very high proportion of their national income is being spent directly for armaments . It runs from thirty to as high as fifty percent . We are fortunate . The proportion that we in the United States spend is far less eleven or twelve percent . How happy we are that the circumstances of the moment permit us to put our money into bridges and boulevards , dams and reforestation , the conservation of our soil and many other kinds of useful works rather than into huge standing armies and vast supplies of implements of war . I am compelled and you are compelled , nevertheless , to look ahead . The peace , the freedom and the security of ninety percent of the population of the world is being jeopardized by the remaining ten percent . who are threatening a breakdown of all international order and law . Surely the ninety percent who want to live in peace under law and in accordance with moral standards that have received almost universal acceptance through the centuries , can and must find some way to make their will prevail . The situation is definitely of universal concern . The questions involved relate not merely to violations of specific provisions of particular treaties they are questions of war and of peace , of international law and especially of principles of humanity . It is true that they involve definite violations of agreements , and especially of the Covenant of the League of Nations , the Briand Kellogg Pact and the Nine Power Treaty . But they also involve problems of world economy , world security and world humanity . It is true that the moral consciousness of the world must recognize the importance of removing injustices and well founded grievances but at the same time it must be aroused to the cardinal necessity of honoring sanctity of treaties , of respecting the rights and liberties of others and of putting an end to acts of international aggression . It seems to be unfortunately true that the epidemic of world lawlessness is spreading . When an epidemic of physical disease starts to spread , the community approves and joins in a quarantine of the patients in order to protect the health of the community against the spread of the disease . It is my determination to pursue a policy of peace . It is my determination to adopt every practicable measure to avoid involvement in war . It ought to be inconceivable that in this modern era , and in the face of experience , any nation could be so foolish and ruthless as to run the risk of plunging the whole world into war by invading and violating , in contravention of solemn treaties , the territory of other nations that have done them no real harm and are too weak to protect themselves adequately . Yet the peace of the world and the welfare and security of every nation , including our own , is today being threatened by that very thing . No nation which refuses to exercise forbearance and to respect the freedom and rights of others can long remain strong and retain the confidence and respect of other nations . No nation ever loses its dignity or its good standing by conciliating its differences , and by exercising great patience with , and consideration for , the rights of other nations . War is a contagion , whether it be declared or undeclared . It can engulf states and peoples remote from the original scene of hostilities . We are determined to keep out of war , yet we cannot insure ourselves against the disastrous effects of war and the dangers of involvement . We are adopting such measures as will minimize our risk of involvement , but we cannot have complete protection in a world of disorder in which confidence and security have broken down . If civilization is to survive the principles of the Prince of Peace must be restored . Trust between nations must be revived . Most important of all , the will for peace on the part of peace loving nations must express itself to the end that nations that may be tempted to violate their agreements and the rights of others will desist from such a course . There must be positive endeavors to preserve peace . America hates war . America hopes for peace . Therefore , America actively engages in the search for peace .<speech_sep>Last Thursday I described in detail certain economic problems which everyone admits now face the Nation . For the many messages which have come to me after that speech , and which it is physically impossible to answer individually , I take this means of saying thank you . Tonight , sitting at my desk in the White House , I make my first radio report to the people in my second term of office . I am reminded of that evening in March , four years ago , when I made my first radio report to you . We were then in the midst of the great banking crisis . Soon after , with the authority of the Congress , we asked the Nation to turn over all of its privately held gold , dollar for dollar , to the Government of the United States . Today s recovery proves how right that policy was . But when , almost two years later , it came before the Supreme Court its constitutionality was upheld only by a five to four vote . The change of one vote would have thrown all the affairs of this great Nation back into hopeless chaos . In effect , four Justices ruled that the right under a private contract to exact a pound of flesh was more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to establish an enduring Nation . In 1933 you and I knew that we must never let our economic system get completely out of joint again that we could not afford to take the risk of another great depression . We also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark days was to have a government with power to prevent and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that system out of joint . We then began a program of remedying those abuses and inequalities to give balance and stability to our economic system to make it bomb proof against the causes of 1929 . Today we are only part way through that program and recovery is speeding up to a point where the dangers of 1929 are again becoming possible , not this week or month perhaps , but within a year or two . National laws are needed to complete that program . Individual or local or state effort alone cannot protect us in 1937 any better than ten years ago . It will take time and plenty of time to work out our remedies administratively even after legislation is passed . To complete our program of protection in time , therefore , we cannot delay one moment in making certain that our National Government has power to carry through . Four years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour . It was almost too late . If we learned anything from the depression we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and debate , always postponing the day of decision . The American people have learned from the depression . For in the last three national elections an overwhelming majority of them voted a mandate that the Congress and the President begin the task of providing that protection not after long years of debate , but now . The Courts , however , have cast doubts on the ability of the elected Congress to protect us against catastrophe by meeting squarely our modern social and economic conditions . We are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection . It is a quiet crisis . There are no lines of depositors outside closed banks . But to the far sighted it is far reaching in its possibilities of injury to America . I want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis the need to meet the unanswered challenge of one third of a Nation ill nourished , ill clad , ill housed . Last Thursday I described the American form of Government as a three horse team provided by the Constitution to the American people so that their field might be plowed . The three horses are , of course , the three branches of government the Congress , the Executive and the Courts . Two of the horses are pulling in unison today the third is not . Those who have intimated that the President of the United States is trying to drive that team , overlook the simple fact that the President , as Chief Executive , is himself one of the three horses . It is the American people themselves who are in the driver s seat . It is the American people themselves who want the furrow plowed . It is the American people themselves who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other two . I hope that you have re read the Constitution of the United States in these past few weeks . Like the Bible , it ought to be read again and again . It is an easy document to understand when you remember that it was called into being because the Articles of Confederation under which the original thirteen States tried to operate after the Revolution showed the need of a National Government with power enough to handle national problems . In its Preamble , the Constitution states that it was intended to form a more perfect Union and promote the general welfare and the powers given to the Congress to carry out those purposes can be best described by saying that they were all the powers needed to meet each and every problem which then had a national character and which could not be met by merely local action . But the framers went further . Having in mind that in succeeding generations many other problems then undreamed of would become national problems , they gave to the Congress the ample broad powers to levy taxes . . . and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States . That , my friends , is what I honestly believe to have been the clear and underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a Federal Constitution to create a National Government with national power , intended as they said , to form a more perfect union . . . for ourselves and our posterity . For nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the Congress and the Court . Then Congress passed a statute which , in 1803 , the Court said violated an express provision of the Constitution . The Court claimed the power to declare it unconstitutional and did so declare it . But a little later the Court itself admitted that it was an extraordinary power to exercise and through Justice Washington laid down this limitation upon it It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom , the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body , by which any law is passed , to presume in favor of its validity until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt . But since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation , the Court has more and more often and more and more boldly asserted a power to veto laws passed by the Congress and State Legislatures in complete disregard of this original limitation . In the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside . The Court has been acting not as a judicial body , but as a policy making body . When the Congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture , to improve the conditions of labor , to safeguard business against unfair competition , to protect our national resources , and in many other ways , to serve our clearly national needs , the majority of the Court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of these acts of the Congress and to approve or disapprove the public policy written into these laws . That is not only my accusation . It is the accusation of most distinguished justices of the present Supreme Court . I have not the time to quote to you all the language used by dissenting justices in many of these cases . But in the case holding the Railroad Retirement Act unconstitutional , for instance , Chief Justice Hughes said in a dissenting opinion that the majority opinion was a departure from sound principles , and placed an unwarranted limitation upon the commerce clause . And three other justices agreed with him . In the case of holding the AAA unconstitutional , Justice Stone said of the majority opinion that it was a tortured construction of the Constitution . And two other justices agreed with him . In the case holding the New York minimum wage law unconstitutional , Justice Stone said that the majority were actually reading into the Constitution their own personal economic predilections , and that if the legislative power is not left free to choose the methods of solving the problems of poverty , subsistence , and health of large numbers in the community , then government is to be rendered impotent . And two other justices agreed with him . In the face of these dissenting opinions , there is no basis for the claim made by some members of the Court that something in the Constitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart the will of the people . In the face of such dissenting opinions , it is perfectly clear that , as Chief Justice Hughes has said , We are under a Constitution , but the Constitution is what the judges say it is . The Court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions has improperly set itself up as a third house of the Congress a super legislature , as one of the justices has called it reading into the Constitution words and implications which are not there , and which were never intended to be there . We have , therefore , reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself . We must find a way to take an appeal from the Supreme Court to the Constitution itself . We want a Supreme Court which will do justice under the Constitution and not over it . In our courts we want a government of laws and not of men . I want as all Americans want an independent judiciary as proposed by the framers of the Constitution . That means a Supreme Court that will enforce the Constitution as written , that will refuse to amend the Constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power in other words by judicial say so . It does not mean a judiciary so independent that it can deny the existence of facts which are universally recognized . How then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us It was said in last year s Democratic platform , If these problems cannot be effectively solved within the Constitution , we shall seek such clarifying amendment as will assure the power to enact those laws , adequately to regulate commerce , protect public health and safety , and safeguard economic security . In other words , we said we would seek an amendment only if every other possible means by legislation were to fail . When I commenced to review the situation with the problem squarely before me , I came by a process of elimination to the conclusion that , short of amendments , the only method which was clearly constitutional , and would at the same time carry out other much needed reforms , was to infuse new blood into all our Courts . We must have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice . But , at the same time , we must have Judges who will bring to the Courts a present day sense of the Constitution Judges who will retain in the Courts the judicial functions of a court , and reject the legislative powers which the courts have today assumed . In forty five out of the forty eight States of the Union , Judges are chosen not for life but for a period of years . In many States Judges must retire at the age of seventy . Congress has provided financial security by offering life pensions at full pay for Federal Judges on all Courts who are willing to retire at seventy . In the case of Supreme Court Justices , that pension is 20 , 000 a year . But all Federal Judges , once appointed , can , if they choose , hold office for life , no matter how old they may get to be . What is my proposal It is simply this whenever a Judge or Justice of any Federal Court has reached the age of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension , a new member shall be appointed by the President then in office , with the approval , as required by the Constitution , of the Senate of the United States . That plan has two chief purposes . By bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood , I hope , first , to make the administration of all Federal justice speedier and , therefore , less costly secondly , to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact with modern facts and circumstances under which average men have to live and work . This plan will save our national Constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries . The number of Judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present Judges now over seventy , or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy . If , for instance , any one of the six Justices of the Supreme Court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan , no additional place would be created . Consequently , although there never can be more than fifteen , there may be only fourteen , or thirteen , or twelve . And there may be only nine . There is nothing novel or radical about this idea . It seeks to maintain the Federal bench in full vigor . It has been discussed and approved by many persons of high authority ever since a similar proposal passed the House of Representatives in 1869 . Why was the age fixed at seventy Because the laws of many States , the practice of the Civil Service , the regulations of the Army and Navy , and the rules of many of our Universities and of almost every great private business enterprise , commonly fix the retirement age at seventy years or less . The statute would apply to all the courts in the Federal system . There is general approval so far as the lower Federal courts are concerned . The plan has met opposition only so far as the Supreme Court of the United States itself is concerned . If such a plan is good for the lower courts it certainly ought to be equally good for the highest Court from which there is no appeal . Those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear by crying that I am seeking to pack the Supreme Court and that a baneful precedent will be established . What do they mean by the words packing the Court Let me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of my purposes . If by that phrase packing the Court it is charged that I wish to place on the bench spineless puppets who would disregard the law and would decide specific cases as I wished them to be decided , I make this answer that no President fit for his office would appoint , and no Senate of honorable men fit for their office would confirm , that kind of appointees to the Supreme Court . But if by that phrase the charge is made that I would appoint and the Senate would confirm Justices worthy to sit beside present members of the Court who understand those modern conditions , that I will appoint Justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the Congress on legislative policy , that I will appoint Justices who will act as Justices and not as legislators if the appointment of such Justices can be called packing the Courts , then I say that I and with me the vast majority of the American people favor doing just that thing now . Is it a dangerous precedent for the Congress to change the number of the Justices The Congress has always had , and will have , that power . The number of justices has been changed several times before , in the Administration of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both signers of the Declaration of Independence Andrew jackson , Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant . I suggest only the addition of Justices to the bench in accordance with a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age limit . Fundamentally , if in the future , America cannot trust the Congress it elects to refrain from abuse of our Constitutional usages , democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it of any king of precedent concerning the Judiciary . We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary that we encourage the retirement of elderly Judges by offering them a life pension at full salary . Why then should we leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual Justice It is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and younger blood into the Judiciary . Normally every President appoints a large number of District and Circuit Court Judges and a few members of the Supreme Court . Until my first term practically every President of the United States has appointed at least one member of the Supreme Court . President Taft appointed five members and named a Chief Justice President Wilson , three President Harding , four , including a Chief Justice President Coolidge , one President Hoover , three , including a Chief Justice . Such a succession of appointments should have provided a Court well balanced as to age . But chance and the disinclination of individuals to leave the Supreme bench have now given us a Court in which five Justices will be over seventy five years of age before next June and one over seventy . Thus a sound public policy has been defeated . I now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any such ill balanced Court in the future . I propose that hereafter , when a Judge reaches the age of seventy , a new and younger Judge shall be added to the Court automatically . In this way I propose to enforce a sound public policy by law instead of leaving the composition of our Federal Courts , including the highest , to be determined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals . If such a law as I propose is regarded as establishing a new precedent , is it not a most desirable precedent Like all lawyers , like all Americans , I regret the necessity of this controversy . But the welfare of the United States , and indeed of the Constitution itself , is what we all must think about first . Our difficulty with the Court today rises not from the Court as an institution but from human beings within it . But we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgement of a few men who , being fearful of the future , would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present . This plan of mine is no attack on the Court it seeks to restore the Court to its rightful and historic place in our Constitutional Government and to have it resume its high task of building anew on the Constitution a system of living law . The Court itself can best undo what the Court has done . I have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our efforts to secure results by legislation within the Constitution . I hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be rendered unnecessary . But let us examine the process . There are many types of amendment proposed . Each one is radically different from the other . There is no substantial groups within the Congress or outside it who are agreed on any single amendment . It would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment . It would take months and years thereafter to get a two thirds majority in favor of that amendment in both Houses of the Congress . Then would come the long course of ratification by three fourths of all the States . No amendment which any powerful economic interests or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to oppose has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable time . And thirteen states which contain only five percent of the voting population can block ratification even though the thirty five States with ninety five percent of the population are in favor of it . A very large percentage of newspaper publishers , Chambers of Commerce , Bar Association , Manufacturers Associations , who are trying to give the impression that they really do want a constitutional amendment would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment was proposed , Oh I was for an amendment all right , but this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that I was thinking about . I am therefore , going to spend my time , my efforts and my money to block the amendment , although I would be awfully glad to help get some other kind od amendment ratified . Two groups oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a constitutional amendment . The first includes those who fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along modern lines . This is the same group who during the campaign last Fall tried to block the mandate of the people . Now they are making a last stand . And the strategy of that last stand is to suggest the time consuming process of amendment in order to kill off by delay the legislation demanded by the mandate . To them I say I do not think you will be able long to fool the American people as to your purposes . The other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the amendment process is the best and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if they could agree on one . To them I say we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to our present difficulties . When the time comes for action , you will find that many of those who pretend to support you will sabotage any constructive amendment which is proposed . Look at these strange bed fellows of yours . When before have you found them really at your side in your fights for progress And remember one thing more . Even if an amendment were passed , and even if in the years to come it were to be ratified , its meaning would depend upon the kind of Justices who would be sitting on the Supreme Court Bench . An amendment , like the rest of the Constitution , is what the Justices say it is rather than what its framers or you might hope it is . This proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the civil or religious liberties so dear to every American . My record as Governor and President proves my devotion to those liberties . You who know me can have no fear that I would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our heritage of freedom . The present attempt by those opposed to progress to play upon the fears of danger to personal liberty brings again to mind that crude and cruel strategy tried by the same opposition to frighten the workers of America in a pay envelope propaganda against the Social Security Law . The workers were not fooled by that propaganda then . The people of America will not be fooled by such propaganda now . I am in favor of action through legislation First , because I believe that it can be passed at this session of the Congress . Second , because it will provide a reinvigorated , liberal minded Judiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheaper justice from bottom to top . Third , because it will provide a series of Federal Courts willing to enforce the Constitution as written , and unwilling to assert legislative powers by writing into it their own political and economic policies . During the past half century the balance of power between the three great branches of the Federal Government , has been tipped out of balance by the Courts in direct contradiction of the high purposes of the framers of the Constitution . It is my purpose to restore that balance . You who know me will accept my solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy is under attack , I seek to make American democracy succeed . You and I will do our part .<speech_sep>It has been several months since I have talked with you concerning the problems of government . Since January , those of us in whom you have vested responsibility have been engaged in the fulfillment of plans and policies which had been widely discussed in previous months . It seemed to us our duty not only to make the right path clear but also to tread that path . As we review the achievements of this session of the Seventy third Congress , it is made increasingly clear that its task was essentially that of completing and fortifying the work it had begun in March , l933 . That was no easy task , but the Congress was equal to it . It has been well said that while there were a few exceptions , this Congress displayed a greater freedom from mere partisanship than any other peace time Congress since the Administration of President Washington himself . The session was distinguished by the extent and variety of legislation enacted and by the intelligence and good will of debate upon these measures . I mention only a few of the major enactments . It provided for the readjustment of the debt burden through the corporate and municipal bankruptcy acts and the farm relief act . It lent a hand to industry by encouraging loans to solvent industries unable to secure adequate help from banking institutions . It strengthened the integrity of finance through the regulation of securities exchanges . It provided a rational method of increasing our volume of foreign trade through reciprocal trading agreements . It strengthened our naval forces to conform with the intentions and permission of existing treaty rights . It made further advances towards peace in industry through the labor adjustment act . It supplemented our agricultural policy through measures widely demanded by farmers themselves and intended to avert price destroying surpluses . It strengthened the hand of the Federal Government in its attempts to suppress gangster crime . It took definite steps towards a national housing program through an act which I signed today designed to encourage private capital in the rebuilding of the homes of the Nation . It created a permanent Federal body for the just regulation of all forms of communication , including the telephone , the telegraph and the radio . Finally , and I believe most important , it reorganized , simplified and made more fair and just our monetary system , setting up standards and policies adequate to meet the necessities of modern economic life , doing justice to both gold and silver as the metal bases behind the currency of the United States . In the consistent development of our previous efforts toward the saving and safeguarding of our national life , I have continued to recognize three related steps . The first was relief , because the primary concern of any Government dominated by the humane ideals of democracy is the simple principle that in a land of vast resources no one should be permitted to starve . Relief was and continues to be our first consideration . It calls for large expenditures and will continue in modified form to do so for a long time to come . We may as well recognize that fact . It comes from the paralysis that arose as the after effect of that unfortunate decade characterized by a mad chase for unearned riches and an unwillingness of leaders in almost every walk of life to look beyond their own schemes and speculations . In our administration of relief we follow two principles First , that direct giving shall , wherever possible , be supplemented by provision for useful and remunerative work and , second , that where families in their existing surroundings will in all human probability never find an opportunity for full self maintenance , happiness and enjoyment , we will try to give them a new chance in new surroundings . The second step was recovery , and it is sufficient for me to ask each and every one of you to compare the situation in agriculture and in industry today with what it was fifteen months ago . At the same time we have recognized the necessity of reform and reconstruction reform because much of our trouble today and in the past few years has been due to a lack of understanding of the elementary principles of justice and fairness by those in whom leadership in business and finance was placed reconstruction because new conditions in our economic life as well as old but neglected conditions had to be corrected . Substantial gains well known to all of you have justified our course . I could cite statistics to you as unanswerable measures of our national progress statistics to show the gain in the average weekly pay envelope of workers in the great majority of industries statistics to show hundreds of thousands reemployed in private industries and other hundreds of thousands given new employment through the expansion of direct and indirect government assistance of many kinds , although , of course , there are those exceptions in professional pursuits whose economic improvement , of necessity , will be delayed . I also could cite statistics to show the great rise in the value of farm products statistics to prove the demand for consumers goods , ranging all the way from food and clothing to automobiles and of late to prove the rise in the demand for durable goods statistics to cover the great increase in bank deposits and to show the scores of thousands of homes and of farms which have been saved from foreclosure . But the simplest way for each of you to judge recovery lies in the plain facts of your own individual situation . Are you better off than you were last year Are your debts less burdensome Is your bank account more secure Are your working conditions better Is your faith in your own individual future more firmly grounded Also , let me put to you another simple question Have you as an individual paid too high a price for these gains Plausible self seekers and theoretical die hards will tell you of the loss of individual liberty . Answer this question also out of the facts of your own life . Have you lost any of your rights or liberty or constitutional freedom of action and choice Turn to the Bill of Rights of the Constitution , which I have solemnly sworn to maintain and under which your freedom rests secure . Read each provision of that Bill of Rights and ask yourself whether you personally have suffered the impairment of a single jot of these great assurances . I have no question in my mind as to what your answer will be . The record is written in the experiences of your own personal lives . In other words , it is not the overwhelming majority of the farmers or manufacturers or workers who deny the substantial gains of the past year . The most vociferous of the doubting Thomases may be divided roughly into two groups First , those who seek special political privilege and , second , those who seek special financial privilege . About a year ago I used as an illustration the 90 percent of the cotton manufacturers of the United States who wanted to do the right thing by their employees and by the public but were prevented from doing so by the 10 percent who undercut them by unfair practices and un American standards . It is well for us to remember that humanity is a long way from being perfect and that a selfish minority in every walk of life farming , business , finance and even Government service itself will always continue to think of themselves first and their fellow being second . In the working out of a great national program which seeks the primary good of the greater number , it is true that the toes of some people are being stepped on and are going to be stepped on . But these toes belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or to gain position or riches or both by some short cut which is harmful to the greater good . In the execution of the powers conferred on it by Congress , the Administration needs and will tirelessly seek the best ability that the country affords . Public service offers better rewards in the opportunity for service than ever before in our history not great salaries , but enough to live on . In the building of this service there are coming to us men and women with ability and courage from every part of the Union . The days of the seeking of mere party advantage through the misuse of public power are drawing to a close . We are increasingly demanding and getting devotion to the public service on the part of every member of the Administration , high and low . The program of the past year is definitely in operation and that operation month by month is being made to fit into the web of old and new conditions . This process of evolution is well illustrated by the constant changes in detailed organization and method going on in the National Recovery Administration . With every passing month we are making strides in the orderly handling of the relationship between employees and employers . Conditions differ , of course , in almost every part of the country and in almost every industry . Temporary methods of adjustment are being replaced by more permanent machinery and , I am glad to say , by a growing recognition on the part of employers and employees of the desirability of maintaining fair relationships all around . So also , while almost everybody has recognized the tremendous strides in the elimination of child labor , in the payment of not less than fair minimum wages and in the shortening of hours , we are still feeling our way in solving problems which relate to self government in industry , especially where such self government tends to eliminate the fair operation of competition . In this same process of evolution we are keeping before us the objectives of protecting on the one hand industry against chiselers within its own ranks , and on the other hand the consumer through the maintenance of reasonable competition for the prevention of the unfair sky rocketing of retail prices . But , in addition to this our immediate task , we must still look to the larger future . I have pointed out to the Congress that we are seeking to find the way once more to well known , long established but to some degree forgotten ideals and values . We seek the security of the men , women and children of the Nation . That security involves added means of providing better homes for the people of the Nation . That is the first principle of our future program . The second is to plan the use of land and water resources of this country to the end that the means of livelihood of our citizens may be more adequate to meet their daily needs . And , finally , the third principle is to use the agencies of government to assist in the establishment of means to provide sound and adequate protection against the vicissitudes of modern life in other words , social insurance . Later in the year I hope to talk with you more fully about these plans . A few timid people , who fear progress , will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing . Sometimes they will call it Fascism , sometimes Communism , sometimes Regimentation , sometimes Socialism . But , in so doing , they are trying to make very complex and theoretical something that is really very simple and very practical . I believe in practical explanations and in practical policies . I believe that what we are doing today is a necessary fulfillment of what Americans have always been doing a fulfillment of old and tested American ideals . Let me give you a simple illustration While I am away from Washington this summer , a long needed renovation of and addition to our White House office building is to be started . The architects have planned a few new rooms built into the present all too small one story structure . We are going to include in this addition and in this renovation modern electric wiring and modern plumbing and modern means of keeping the offices cool in the hot Washington summers . But the structural lines of the old Executive Office Building will remain . The artistic lines of the White House buildings were the creation of master builders when our Republic was young . The simplicity and the strength of the structure remain in the face of every modern test . But within this magnificent pattern , the necessities of modern government business require constant reorganization and rebuilding . If I were to listen to the arguments of some prophets of calamity who are talking these days , I should hesitate to make these alterations . I should fear that while I am away for a few weeks the architects might build some strange new Gothic tower or a factory building or perhaps a replica of the Kremlin or of the Potsdam Palace . But I have no such fears . The architects and builders are men of common sense and of artistic American tastes . They know that the principles of harmony and of necessity itself require that the building of the new structure shall blend with the essential lines of the old . It is this combination of the old and the new that marks orderly peaceful progress not only in building buildings but in building government itself . Our new structure is a part of and a fulfillment of the old . All that we do seeks to fulfill the historic traditions of the American people . Other nations may sacrifice democracy for the transitory stimulation of old and discredited autocracies . We are restoring confidence and well being under the rule of the people themselves . We remain , as John Marshall said a century ago , emphatically and truly , a government of the people . Our government in form and in substance . . . emanates from them . Its powers are granted by them , and are to be exercised directly on them , and for their benefits . Before I close , I want to tell you of the interest and pleasure with which I look forward to the trip on which I hope to start in a few days . It is a good thing for everyone who can possibly do so to get away at least once a year for a change of scene . I do not want to get into the position of not being able to see the forest because of the thickness of the trees . I hope to visit our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico , in the Virgin Islands , in the Canal Zone and in Hawaii . And , incidentally , it will give me an opportunity to exchange a friendly word of greeting to the Presidents of our sister Republics Haiti , Colombia and Panama . After four weeks on board ship , I plan to land at a port in our Pacific northwest , and then will come the best part of the whole trip , for I am hoping to inspect a number of our new great national projects on the Columbia , Missouri and Mississippi Rivers , to see some of our national parks and , incidentally , to learn much of actual conditions during the trip across the continent back to Washington . While I was in France during the War our boys used to call the United States God s country . Let us make it and keep it God s country .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans and my friends Tonight my single duty is to speak to the whole of America . Until four thirty this morning I had hoped against hope that some miracle would prevent a devastating war in Europe and bring to an end the invasion of Poland by Germany . For four long years a succession of actual wars and constant crises have shaken the entire world and have threatened in each case to bring on the gigantic conflict which is today unhappily a fact . It is right that I should recall to your minds the consistent and at time successful efforts of your Government in these crises to throw the full weight of the United States into the cause of peace . In spite of spreading wars I think that we have every right and every reason to maintain as a national policy the fundamental moralities , the teachings of religion and the continuation of efforts to restore peace for because some day , though the time may be distant , we can be of even greater help to a crippled humanity . It is right , too , to point out that the unfortunate events of these recent years have , without question , been based on the use of force or and the threat of force . And it seems to me clear , even at the outbreak of this great war , that the influence of America should be consistent in seeking for humanity a final peace which will eliminate , as far as it is possible to do so , the continued use of force between nations . It is , of course , impossible to predict the future . I have my constant stream of information from American representatives and other sources throughout the world . You , the people of this country , are receiving news through your radios and your newspapers at every hour of the day . You are , I believe , the most enlightened and the best informed people in all the world at this moment . You are subjected to no censorship of news , and I want to add that your Government has no information which it hesitates to withholds from you or which it has any thought of withholding from you . At the same time , as I told my Press Conference on Friday , it is of the highest importance that the press and the radio use the utmost caution to discriminate between actual verified fact on the one hand , and mere rumor on the other . I can add to that by saying that I hope the people of this country will also discriminate most carefully between news and rumor . Do not believe of necessity everything you hear or read . Check up on it first . You must master at the outset a simple but unalterable fact in modern foreign relations between nations . When peace has been broken anywhere , the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger . It is easy for you and for me to shrug our shoulders and to say that conflicts taking place thousands of miles from the continental United States , and , indeed , thousands of miles from the whole American Hemisphere , do not seriously affect the Americas and that all the United States has to do is to ignore them and go about our its own business . Passionately though we may desire detachment , we are forced to realize that every word that comes through the air , every ship that sails the sea , every battle that is fought does affect the American future . Let no man or woman thoughtlessly or falsely talk of America sending its armies to European fields . At this moment there is being prepared a proclamation of American neutrality . This would have been done even if there had been no neutrality statute on the books , for this proclamation is in accordance with international law and in accordance with American policy . This will be followed by a Proclamation required by the existing Neutrality Act . And I trust that in the days to come our neutrality can be made a true neutrality . It is of the utmost importance that the people of this country , with the best information in the world , think things through . The most dangerous enemies of American peace are those who , without well rounded Information on the whole broad subject of the past , the present and the future , undertake to speak with assumed authority , to talk in terms of glittering generalities , to give to the nation assurances or prophecies which are of little present or future value . I myself cannot and do not prophesy the course of events abroad and the reason is that because I have of necessity such a complete picture of what is going on in every part of the world , that I do not dare to do so . And the other reason is that I think it is honest for me to be honest with the people of the United States . I cannot prophesy the immediate economic effect of this new war on our nation but I do say that no American has the moral right to profiteer at the expense either of his fellow citizens or of the men , the women and the children who are living and dying in the midst of war in Europe . Some things we do know . Most of us in the United States believe in spiritual values . Most of us , regardless of what church we belong to , believe in the spirit of the New Testament a great teaching which opposes itself to the use of force , of armed force , of marching armies and falling bombs . The overwhelming masses of our people seek peace peace at home , and the kind of peace in other lands which will not jeopardize our peace at home . We have certain ideas and certain ideals of national safety and we must act to preserve that safety today and to preserve the safety of our children in future years . That safety is and will be bound up with the safety of the Western Hemisphere and of the seas adjacent thereto . We seek to keep war from our own firesides by keeping war from coming to the Americas . For that we have historic precedent that goes back to the days of the Administration of President George Washington . It is serious enough and tragic enough to every American family in every state in the Union to live in a world that is torn by wars on other Continents . And those wars today they affect every American home . It is our national duty to use every effort to keep them those wars out of the Americas . And at this time let me make the simple plea that partisanship and selfishness be adjourned and that national unity be the thought that underlies all others . This nation will remain a neutral nation , but I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought as well . Even a neutral has a right to take account of facts . Even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind or close his conscience . I have said not once but many times that I have seen war and that I hate war . I say that again and again . I hope the United States will keep out of this war . I believe that it will . And I give you assurance s and reassurance that every effort of your Government will be directed toward that end . As long as it remains within my power to prevent , there will be no blackout of peace in the United States .<speech_sep>On each national day of Inauguration since 1789 , the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the United States . In Washington s day the task of the people was to create and weld together a Nation . In Lincoln s day the task of the people was to preserve that Nation from disruption from within . In this day the task of the people is to save that Nation and its institutions from disruption from without . To us there has come a time , in the midst of swift happenings , to pause for a moment and take stock to recall what our place in history has been , and to rediscover what we are and what we may be . If we do not , we risk the real peril of isolation , the real peril of inaction . Lives of Nations are determined not by the count of years , but by the lifetime of the human spirit . The life of a man is threescore years and ten a little more , a little less . The life of a Nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live . There are men who doubt this . There are men who believe that democracy , as a form of government and a frame of life , is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that , for some unexplained reason , tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future and that freedom is an ebbing tide . But we Americans know that this is not true . Eight years ago , when the life of this Republic seemed frozen by a fatalistic terror , we proved that this is not true . We were in the midst of shock but we acted . We acted quickly , boldly , decisively . These later years have been living years fruitful years for the people of this democracy . For they have brought to us greater security and , I hope , a better understanding that life s ideals are to be measured in other than material things . Most vital to our present and to our future is this experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at home put away many evil things built new structures on enduring lines and , through it all , maintained the fact of its democracy . For action has been taken within the three way framework of the Constitution of the United States . The coordinate branches of the Government continue freely to function . The Bill of Rights remains inviolate . The freedom of elections is wholly maintained . Prophets of the downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught . No , democracy is not dying . We know it because we have seen it revive and grow . We know it cannot die because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority . We know it because democracy alone , of all forms of government , enlists the full force of men s enlightened will . We know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life . We know it because , if we look below the surface , we sense it still spreading on every continent for it is the most humane , the most advanced , and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society . A Nation , like a person , has a body a body that must be fed and clothed and housed , invigorated and rested , in a manner that measures up to the standards of our time . A Nation , like a person , has a mind a mind that must be kept informed and alert , that must know itself , that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors all the other Nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world . A Nation , like a person , has something deeper , something more permanent , something larger than the sum of all its parts . It is that something which matters most to its future which calls forth the most sacred guarding of its present . It is a thing for which we find it difficult even impossible to hit upon a single , simple word . And yet , we all understand what it is the spirit the faith of America . It is the product of centuries . It was born in the multitudes of those who came from many lands some of high degree , but mostly plain people who sought here , early and late , to find freedom more freely . The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history . It is human history . It permeated the ancient life of early peoples . It blazed anew in the Middle Ages . It was written in Magna Charta . In the Americas its impact has been irresistible . America has been the New World in all tongues , and to all peoples , not because this continent was a new found land , but because all those who came here believed they could create upon this continent a new life a life that should be new in freedom . Its vitality was written into our own Mayflower Compact , into the Declaration of Independence , into the Constitution of the United States , into the Gettysburg Address . Those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit , and the millions who followed , and the stock that sprang from them all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation . The hopes of the Republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self serving wealth . We know that we still have far to go that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen , in the measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land . But it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone . It is not enough to clothe and feed the body of this Nation , to instruct , and inform its mind . For there is also the spirit . And of the three , the greatest is the spirit . Without the body and the mind , as all men know , the Nation could not live . But if the spirit of America were killed , even though the Nation s body and mind , constricted in an alien world , lived on , the America we know would have perished . That spirit that faith speaks to us in our daily lives in ways often unnoticed , because they seem so obvious . It speaks to us here in the Capital of the Nation . It speaks to us through the processes of governing in the sovereignties of 48 States . It speaks to us in our counties , in our cities , in our towns , and in our villages . It speaks to us from the other Nations of the hemisphere , and from those across the seas the enslaved , as well as the free . Sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voices of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom is such an old , old story . The destiny of America was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first President in his first Inaugural in 1789 words almost directed , it would seem , to this year of 1941 The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered . . . deeply , . . . finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people . If you and I in this later day lose that sacred fire if we let it be smothered with doubt and fear then we shall reject the destiny which Washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish . The preservation of the spirit and faith of the Nation does , and will , furnish the highest justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense . In the face of great perils never before encountered , our strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy . For this we muster the spirit of America , and the faith of America . We do not retreat . We are not content to stand still . As Americans , we go forward , in the service of our country , by the will of God .<speech_sep>I have already indicated to you why I accept the nomination that you have offered me in spite of my desire to retire to the quiet of private life . You in this Convention are aware of what I have sought to gain for the Nation , and you have asked me to continue . It seems wholly likely that within the next four years our armed forces , and those of our allies , will have gained a complete victory over Germany and Japan , sooner or later , and that the world once more will be at peace under a system , we hope that will prevent a new world war . In an event , whenever that time comes , new hands will then have full opportunity to realize the ideals which we seek . In the last three elections the people of the United States have transcended party affiliation . Not only Democrats but also forward looking Republicans and millions of independent voters have turned to progressive leadership a leadership which has sought consistently and with fair success to advance the lot of the average American citizen who had been so forgotten during the period after the last war . I am confident that they will continue to look to that same kind of liberalism to build our safer economy for the future . I am sure that you will understand me when I say that my decision , expressed to you formally tonight , is based solely on a sense of obligation to serve if called upon to do so by the people of the United States . I shall not campaign , in the usual sense , for the office . In these days of tragic sorrow , I do not consider it fitting . And besides , in these days of global warfare , I shall not be able to find the time . I shall , however , feel free to report to the people the facts about matters of concern to them and especially to correct any misrepresentations . During the past few days I have been coming across the whole width of the continent , to a naval base where I am speaking to you now from the train . As I was crossing the fertile lands and the wide plains and the Great Divide , I could not fail to think of the new relationship between the people of our farms and cities and villages and the people of the rest of the world overseas on the islands of the Pacific , in the Far East , and in the other Americas , in Britain and Normandy and Germany and Poland and Russia itself . For Oklahoma and California , for example , are becoming a part of all these distant spots as greatly as Massachusetts and Virginia were a part of the European picture in 1778 . Today , Oklahoma and California are being defended in Normandy and on Saipan and they must be defended there for what happens in Normandy and Saipan vitally affects the security and well being of every human being in Oklahoma and California . Mankind changes the scope and the breadth of its thought and vision slowly indeed . In the days of the Roman Empire eyes were focused on Europe and the Mediterranean area . The civilization in the Far East was barely known . The American continents were unheard of . And even after the people of Europe began to spill over to other continents , the people of North America in Colonial days knew only their Atlantic seaboard and a tiny portion of the other Americas , and they turned mostly for trade and international relationship to Europe . Africa , at that time , was considered only as the provider of human chattels . Asia was essentially unknown to our ancestors . During the nineteenth century , during that era of development and expansion on this continent , we felt a natural isolation geographic , economic , and political an isolation from the vast world which lay overseas . Not until this generation roughly this century have people here and elsewhere been compelled more and more to widen the orbit of their vision to include every part of the world . Yes , it has been a wrench perhaps but a very necessary one . It is good that we are all getting that broader vision . For we shall need it after the war . The isolationists and the ostriches who plagued our thinking before Pearl Harbor are becoming slowly extinct . The American people now know that all Nations of the world large and small will have to play their appropriate part in keeping the peace by force , and in deciding peacefully the disputes which might lead to war . We all know how truly the world has become one that if Germany and Japan , for example , were to come through this war with their philosophies established and their armies intact , our own grandchildren would again have to be fighting in their day for their liberties and their lives . Some day soon we shall all be able to fly to any other part of the world within twenty four hours . Oceans will no longer figure as greatly in our physical defense as they have in the past . For our own safety and for our own economic good , therefore if for no other reason we must take a leading part in the maintenance of peace and in the increase of trade among all the Nations of the world . And that is why your Government for many , many months has been laying plans , and studying the problems of the near future preparing itself to act so that the people of the United States may not suffer hardships after the war , may continue constantly to improve their standards , and may join with other Nations in doing the same . There are even now working toward that end , the best staff in all our history men and women of all parties and from every part of the Nation . I realize that planning is a word which in some places brings forth sneers . But , for example , before our entry into the war it was planning , which made possible the magnificent organization and equipment of the Army and Navy of the United States which are fighting for us and for our civilization today . Improvement through planning is the order of the day . Even military affairs , things do not stand still . An army or a navy trained and equipped and fighting according to a 1932 model would not have been a safe reliance in 1944 . And if we are to progress in our civilization , improvement is necessary in other fields in the physical things that are a part of our daily lives , and also in the concepts of social justice at home and abroad . I am now at this naval base in the performance of my duties under the Constitution . The war waits for no elections . Decisions must be made plans must be laid strategy must be carried out . They do not concern merely a party or a group . They will affect the daily lives of Americans for generations to come . What is the job before us in 1944 First , to win the war to win the war fast , to win it overpoweringly . Second , to form worldwide international organizations , and to arrange to use the armed forces of the sovereign Nations of the world to make another war impossible within the foreseeable future . And third , to build an economy for our returning veterans and for all Americans which will provide employment and provide decent standards of living . The people of the United States will decide this fall whether they wish to turn over this 1944 job this worldwide job to inexperienced or immature hands , to those who opposed lend lease and international cooperation against the forces of aggression and tyranny , until they could read the polls of popular sentiment or whether they wish to leave it to those who saw the danger from abroad , who met it head on , and who now have seized the offensive and carried the war to its present stages of success to those who , by international conferences and united actions have begun to build that kind of common understanding and cooperative experience which will be so necessary in the world to come . They will also decide , these people of ours , whether they will entrust the task of postwar reconversion to those who offered the veterans of the last war breadlines and apple selling and who finally led the American people down to the abyss of 1932 or whether they will leave it to those who rescued American business , agriculture , industry , finance , and labor in 1933 , and who have already planned and put through much legislation to help our veterans resume their normal occupations in a well ordered reconversion process . They will not decide these questions by reading glowing words or platform pledges the mouthings of those who are willing to promise anything and everything contradictions , inconsistencies , impossibilities anything which might snare a few votes here and a few votes there . They will decide on the record the record written on the seas , on the land , and in the skies . They will decide on the record of our domestic accomplishments in recovery and reform since March 4 , 1933 . And they will decide on the record of our war production and food production unparalleled in all history , in spite of the doubts and sneers of those in high places who said it cannot be done . They will decide on the record of the International Food Conference , of N . R . A . , of the International Labor Conference , of the International Education Conference , of the International Monetary Conference . And they will decide on the record written in the Atlantic Charter , at Casablanca , at Cairo , at Moscow , and at Teheran . We have made mistakes . Who has not Things will not always be perfect . Are they ever perfect , in human affairs But the objective at home and abroad has always been clear before us . Constantly , we have made steady , sure progress toward that objective . The record is plain and unmistakable as to that a record for everyone to read . The greatest wartime President in our history , after a wartime election which he called the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country , set the goal for the United States , a goal in terms as applicable today as they were in 1865 terms which the human mind cannot improve . . . . with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the Nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow , and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves , and with all Nations .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans The Navy Department of the United States has reported to me that on the morning of September fourth the United States destroyer GREEproceeding in full daylight towards Iceland , had reached a point southeast of Greenland . She was carrying American mail to Iceland . She was flying the American flag . Her identity as an American ship was unmistakable . She was then and there attacked by a submarine . Germany admits that it was a German submarine . The submarine deliberately fired a torpedo at the GREEfollowed later by another torpedo attack . In spite of what Hitler s propaganda bureau has invented , and in spite of what any American obstructionist organization may prefer to believe , I tell you the blunt fact that the German submarine fired first upon this American destroyer without warning , and with deliberate design to sink her . Our destroyer , at the time , was in waters which the Government of the United States had declared to be waters of self defense surrounding outposts of American protection in the Atlantic . In the North of the Atlantic , outposts have been established by us in Iceland , in Greenland , in Labrador and in Newfoundland . Through these waters there pass many ships of many flags . They bear food and other supplies to civilians and they bear material of war , for which the people of the United States are spending billions of dollars , and which , by Congressional action , they have declared to be essential for the defense of their our own land . The United States destroyer , when attacked , was proceeding on a legitimate mission . If the destroyer was visible to the submarine when the torpedo was fired , then the attack was a deliberate attempt by the Nazis to sink a clearly identified American warship . On the other hand , if the submarine was beneath the surface of the sea and , with the aid of its listening devices , fired in the direction of the sound of the American destroyer without even taking the trouble to learn its identity as the official German communique would indicate then the attack was even more outrageous . For it indicates a policy of indiscriminate violence against any vessel sailing the seas belligerent or non belligerent . This was piracy piracy legally and morally . It was not the first nor the last act of piracy which the Nazi Government has committed against the American flag in this war . For attack has followed attack . A few months ago an American flag merchant ship , the ROBIN MOOwas sunk by a Nazi submarine in the middle of the South Atlantic , under circumstances violating long established international law and violating every principle of humanity . The passengers and the crew were forced into open boats hundreds of miles from land , in direct violation of international agreements signed by nearly all nations including the Government of Germany . No apology , no allegation of mistake , no offer of reparations has come from the Nazi Government . In July , 1941 , nearly two months ago an American battleship in North American waters was followed by a submarine which for a long time sought to maneuver itself into a position of attack upon the battleship . The periscope of the submarine was clearly seen . No British or American submarines were within hundreds of miles of this spot at the time , so the nationality of the submarine is clear . Five days ago a United States Navy ship on patrol picked up three survivors of an American owned ship operating under the flag of our sister Republic of Panama the SESSOn August seventeenth , she had been first torpedoed without warning , and then shelled , near Greenland , while carrying civilian supplies to Iceland . It is feared that the other members of her crew have been drowned . In view of the established presence of German submarines in this vicinity , there can be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the flag of the attacker . Five days ago , another United States merchant ship , the STEEL SEAFAREwas sunk by a German aircraft in the Red Sea two hundred and twenty miles south of Suez . She was bound for an Egyptian port . So four of the vessels sunk or attacked flew the American flag and were clearly identifiable . Two of these ships were warships of the American Navy . In the fifth case , the vessel sunk clearly carried the flag of our sister Republic of Panama . In the face of all this , we Americans are keeping our feet on the ground . Our type of democratic civilization has outgrown the thought of feeling compelled to fight some other nation by reason of any single piratical attack on one of our ships . We are not becoming hysterical or losing our sense of proportion . Therefore , what I am thinking and saying tonight does not relate to any isolated episode . Instead , we Americans are taking a long range point of view in regard to certain fundamentals and a point of view in regard to a series of events on land and on sea which must be considered as a whole as a part of a world pattern . It would be unworthy of a great nation to exaggerate an isolated incident , or to become inflamed by some one act of violence . But it would be inexcusable folly to minimize such incidents in the face of evidence which makes it clear that the incident is not isolated , but is part of a general plan . The important truth is that these acts of international lawlessness are a manifestation of a design which a design that has been made clear to the American people for a long time . It is the Nazi design to abolish the freedom of the seas , and to acquire absolute control and domination of the these seas for themselves . For with control of the seas in their own hands , the way can obviously become clear for their next step domination of the United States and the domination of the Western Hemisphere by force of arms . Under Nazi control of the seas , no merchant ship of the United States or of any other American Republic would be free to carry on any peaceful commerce , except by the condescending grace of this foreign and tyrannical power . The Atlantic Ocean which has been , and which should always be , a free and friendly highway for us would then become a deadly menace to the commerce of the United States , to the coasts of the United States , and even to the inland cities of the United States . The Hitler Government , in defiance of the laws of the sea , and in defiance of the recognized rights of all other nations , has presumed to declare , on paper , that great areas of the seas even including a vast expanse lying in the Western Hemisphere are to be closed , and that no ships may enter them for any purpose , except at peril of being sunk . Actually they are sinking ships at will and without warning in widely separated areas both within and far outside of these far flung pretended zones . This Nazi attempt to seize control of the oceans is but a counterpart of the Nazi plots now being carried on throughout the Western Hemisphere all designed toward the same end . For Hitler s advance guards not only his avowed agents but also his dupes among us have sought to make ready for him footholds , and bridgeheads in the New World , to be used as soon as he has gained control of the oceans . His intrigues , his plots , his machinations , his sabotage in this New World are all known to the Government of the United States . Conspiracy has followed conspiracy . For example , last year a plot to seize the Government of Uruguay was smashed by the prompt action of that country , which was supported in full by her American neighbors . A like plot was then hatching in Argentina , and that government has carefully and wisely blocked it at every point . More recently , an endeavor was made to subvert the government of Bolivia . And within the past few weeks the discovery was made of secret air landing fields in Colombia , within easy range of the Panama Canal . I could multiply instance s upon instance . To be ultimately successful in world mastery , Hitler knows that he must get control of the seas . He must first destroy the bridge of ships which we are building across the Atlantic and over which we shall continue to roll the implements of war to help destroy him , and to destroy all his works in the end . He must wipe out our patrol on sea and in the air if he is to do it . He must silence the British Navy . I think it must be explained again and over and over again to people who like to think of the United States Navy as an invincible protection , that this can be true only if the British Navy survives . And that , my friends , is simple arithmetic . For if the world outside of the Americas falls under Axis domination , the shipbuilding facilities which the Axis powers would then possess in all of Europe , in the British Isles and in the Far East would be much greater than all the shipbuilding facilities and potentialities of all of the Americas not only greater , but two or three times greater , enough to win . Even if the United States threw all its resources into such a situation , seeking to double and even redouble the size of our Navy , the Axis powers , in control of the rest of the world , would have the manpower and the physical resources to outbuild us several times over . It is time for all Americans , Americans of all the Americas to stop being deluded by the romantic notion that the Americas can go on living happily and peacefully in a Nazi dominated world . Generation after generation , America has battled for the general policy of the freedom of the seas . And that policy is a very simple one , but a basic , a fundamental one . It means that no nation has the right to make the broad oceans of the world at great distances from the actual theatre of land war , unsafe for the commerce of others . That has been our policy , proved time and time again , in all of our history . Our policy has applied from time immemorial the earliest days of the Republic and still applies not merely to the Atlantic but to the Pacific and to all other oceans as well . Unrestricted submarine warfare in 1941 constitutes defiance an act of aggression against that historic American policy . It is now clear that Hitler has begun his campaign to control the seas by ruthless force and by wiping out every vestige of international law , and every vestige of humanity . His intention has been made clear . The American people can have no further illusions about it . No tender whisperings of appeasers that Hitler is not interested in the Western Hemisphere , no soporific lullabies that a wide ocean protects us from him can long have any effect on the hard headed , far sighted and realistic American people . Because of these episodes , because of the movements and operations of German warships , and because of the clear , repeated proof that the present government of Germany has no respect for treaties or for international law , that it has no decent attitude toward neutral nations or human life we Americans are now face to face not with abstract theories but with cruel , relentless facts . This attack on the GREER was no localized military operation in the North Atlantic . This was no mere episode in a struggle between two nations . This was one determined step towards creating a permanent world system based on force , on terror and on murder . And I am sure that even now the Nazis are waiting , waiting to see whether the United States will by silence give them the green light to go ahead on this path of destruction . The Nazi danger to our Western world has long ceased to be a mere possibility . The danger is here now not only from a military enemy but from an enemy of all law , all liberty , all morality , all religion . There has now come a time when you and I must see the cold inexorable necessity of saying to these inhuman , unrestrained seekers of world conquest and permanent world domination by the sword You seek to throw our children and our children s children into your form of terrorism and slavery . You have now attacked our own safety . You shall go no further . Normal practices of diplomacy note writing are of no possible use in dealing with international outlaws who sink our ships and kill our citizens . One peaceful nation after another has met disaster because each refused to look the Nazi danger squarely in the eye until it had actually had them by the throat . The United States will not make that fatal mistake . No act of violence , or no act of intimidation will keep us from maintaining intact two bulwarks of American defense First , our line of supply of material to the enemies of Hitler and second , the freedom of our shipping on the high seas . No matter what it takes , no matter what it costs , we will keep open the line of legitimate commerce in these defensive water of ours . We have sought no shooting war with Hitler . We do not seek it now . But neither do we want peace so much , that we are willing to pay for it by permitting him to attack our naval and merchant ships while they are on legitimate business . I assume that the German leaders are not deeply concerned , tonight or any other time , by what we Americans or the American Government say or publish about them . We cannot bring about the downfall of Nazi ism by the use of long range invective . But when you see a rattlesnake poised to strike , you do not wait until he has struck before you crush him . These Nazi submarines and raiders are the rattlesnakes of the Atlantic . They are a menace to the free pathways of the high seas . They are a challenge to our own sovereignty . They hammer at our most precious rights when they attack ships of the American flag symbols of our independence , our freedom , our very life . It is clear to all Americans that the time has come when the Americas themselves must now be defended . A continuation of attacks in our own waters or in waters which that could be used for further and greater attacks on us , will inevitably weaken our American ability to repel Hitlerism . Do not let us split hairs be hair splitters . Let us not ask ourselves whether the Americas should begin to defend themselves after the fifth first attack , or the tenth fifth attack , or the tenth attack , or the twentieth attack . The time for active defense is now . Do not let us split hairs . Let us not say We will only defend ourselves if the torpedo succeeds in getting home , or if the crew and the passengers are drowned . This is the time for prevention of attack . If submarines or raiders attack in distant waters , they can attack equally well within sight of our own shores . Their very presence in any waters which America deems vital to its defense constitutes an attack . In the waters which we deem necessary for our defense , American naval vessels and American planes will no longer wait until Axis submarines lurking under the water , or Axis raiders on the surface of the sea , strike their deadly blow first . Upon our naval and air patrol now operating in large number over a vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean falls the duty of maintaining the American policy of freedom of the seas now . That means , very simply , and very clearly , that our patrolling vessels and planes will protect all merchant ships not only American ships but ships of any flag engaged in commerce in our defensive waters . They will protect them from submarines they will protect them from surface raiders . This situation is not new . The second President of the United States , John Adams , ordered the United States Navy to clean out European privateers and European ships of war which were infesting the Caribbean and South American waters , destroying American commerce . The third President of the United States , Thomas Jefferson , ordered the United States Navy to end the attacks being made upon American and other ships by the corsairs of the nations of North Africa . My obligation as President is historic it is clear . Yes , it is inescapable . It is no act of war on our part when we decide to protect the seas which that are vital to American defense . The aggression is not ours . Ours is solely defense . But let this warning be clear . From now on , if German or Italian vessels of war enter the waters , the protection of which is necessary for American defense , they do so at their own peril . The orders which I have given as Commander in Chief to of the United States Army and Navy are to carry out that policy at once . The sole responsibility rests upon Germany . There will be no shooting unless Germany continues to seek it . That is my obvious duty in this crisis . That is the clear right of this sovereign nation . That This is the only step possible , if we would keep tight the wall of defense which we are pledged to maintain around this Western Hemisphere . I have no illusions about the gravity of this step . I have not taken it hurriedly or lightly . It is the result of months and months of constant thought and anxiety and prayer . In the protection of your nation and mine it cannot be avoided . The American people have faced other grave crises in their history with American courage , and with American resolution . They will do no less today . They know the actualities of the attacks upon us . They know the necessities of a bold defense against these attacks . They know that the times call for clear heads and fearless hearts . And with that inner strength that comes to a free people conscious of their duty , and conscious of the righteousness of what they do , they will with Divine help and guidance stand their ground against this latest assault upon their democracy , their sovereignty , and their freedom .<speech_sep>Vice President , Speaker , members of the 78th Congress This 78th Congress assembles in one of the great moments in the history of the nation . The past year was perhaps the most crucial for modern civilization the coming year will be filled with violent conflicts yet with high promise of better things . We must appraise the events of 1942 according to their relative importance we must exercise a sense of proportion . First in importance in the American scene has been the inspiring proof of the great qualities of our fighting men . They have demonstrated these qualities in adversity as well as in victory . As long as our flag flies over this Capitol , Americans will honor the soldiers , sailors , and marines who fought our first battles of this war against overwhelming odds the heroes , living and dead , of Wake and Bataan and Guadalcanal , of the Java Sea and Midway and the North Atlantic convoys . Their unconquerable spirit will live forever . By far the largest and most important developments in the whole worldwide strategic picture of 1942 were the events of the long fronts in Russia first , the implacable defense of Stalingrad and , second , the offensives by the Russian armies at various points that started in the latter part of November and which still roll on with great force and effectiveness . The other major events of the year were the series of Japanese advances in the Philippines , the East Indies , Malaya , and Burma the stopping of that Japanese advance in the mid Pacific , the South Pacific , and the Indian Oceans the successful defense of the Near East by the British counterattack through Egypt and Libya the American British occupation of North Africa . Of continuing importance in the year 1942 were the unending and bitterly contested battles of the convoy routes , and the gradual passing of air superiority from the Axis to the United Nations . The Axis powers knew that they must win the war in 1942 or eventually lose everything . I do not need to tell you that our enemies did not win the war in 1942 . In the Pacific area , our most important victory in 1942 was the air and naval battle off Midway Island . That action is historically important because it secured for our use communication lines stretching thousands of miles in every direction . In placing this emphasis on the Battle of Midway , I am not unmindful of other successful actions in the Pacific , in the air and on land and afloat , especially those on the Coral Sea and New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands . But these actions were essentially defensive . They were part of the delaying strategy that characterized this phase of the war . During this period we inflicted steady losses upon the enemy great losses of Japanese planes and naval vessels , transports and cargo ships . As early as one year ago , we set as a primary task in the war of the Pacific a day by day and week by week and month by month destruction of more Japanese war materials than Japanese industry could replace . Most certainly , that task has been and is being performed by our fighting ships and planes . And a large part of this task has been accomplished by the gallant crews of our American submarines who strike on the other side of the Pacific at Japanese ships right up at the very mouth of the harbor of Yokohama . We know that as each day goes by , Japanese strength in ships and planes is going down and down , and American strength in ships and planes is going up and up . And so I sometimes feel that the eventual outcome can now be put on a mathematical basis . That will become evident to the Japanese people themselves when we strike at their own home islands , and bomb them constantly from the air . And in the attacks against Japan , we shall be joined with the heroic people of China that great people whose ideals of peace are so closely akin to our own . Even today we are flying as much lend lease material into China as ever traversed the Burma Road , flying it over mountains 17 , 000 feet high , flying blind through sleet and snow . We shall overcome all the formidable obstacles , and get the battle equipment into China to shatter the power of our common enemy . From this war , China will realize the security , the prosperity and the dignity , which Japan has sought so ruthlessly to destroy . The period of our defensive attrition in the Pacific is drawing to a close . Now our aim is to force the Japanese to fight . Last year , we stopped them . This year , we intend to advance . Turning now to the European theater of war , during this past year it was clear that our first task was to lessen the concentrated pressure on the Russian front by compelling Germany to divert part of her manpower and equipment to another theater of war . After months of secret planning and preparation in the utmost detail , an enormous amphibious expedition was embarked for French North Africa from the United States and the United Kingdom in literally hundreds of ships . It reached its objectives with very small losses , and has already produced an important effect upon the whole situation of the war . It has opened to attack what Churchill well described as the underbelly of the Axis , and it has removed the always dangerous threat of an Axis attack through West Africa against the South Atlantic Ocean and the continent of South America itself . The well timed and splendidly executed offensive from Egypt by the British 8th Army was a part of the same major strategy of the United Nations . Great rains and appalling mud and very limited communications have delayed the final battles of Tunisia . The Axis is reinforcing its strong positions . But I am confident that though the fighting will be tough , when the final Allied assault is made , the last vestige of Axis power will be driven from the whole of the south shores of the Mediterranean . Any review of the year 1942 must emphasize the magnitude and the diversity of the military activities in which this nation has become engaged . As I speak to you , approximately one and a half million of our soldiers , sailors , marines , and fliers are in service outside of our continental limits , all through the world . Our merchant seamen , in addition , are carrying supplies to them and to our allies over every sea lane . Few Americans realize the amazing growth of our air strength , though I am sure our enemy does . Day in and day out our forces are bombing the enemy and meeting him in combat on many different fronts in every part of the world . And for those who question the quality of our aircraft and the ability of our fliers , I point to the fact that , in Africa , we are shooting down two enemy planes to every one we lose , and in the Pacific and the Southwest Pacific we are shooting them down four to one . We pay great tribute the tribute of the United States of America to the fighting men of Russia and China and Britain and the various members of the British Commonwealth the millions of men who through the years of this war have fought our common enemies , and have denied to them the world conquest which they sought . We pay tribute to the soldiers and fliers and seamen of others of the United Nations whose countries have been overrun by Axis hordes . As a result of the Allied occupation of North Africa , powerful units of the French Army and Navy are going into action . They are in action with the United Nations forces . We welcome them as allies and as friends . They join with those Frenchmen who , since the dark days of June , 1940 , have been fighting valiantly for the liberation of their stricken country . We pay tribute to the fighting leaders of our allies , to Winston Churchill , to Joseph Stalin , and to the Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek . Yes , there is a very great unanimity between the leaders of the United Nations . This unity is effective in planning and carrying out the major strategy of this war and in building up and in maintaining the lines of supplies . I cannot prophesy . I cannot tell you when or where the United Nations are going to strike next in Europe . But we are going to strike and strike hard . I cannot tell you whether we are going to hit them in Norway , or through the Low Countries , or in France , or through Sardinia or Sicily , or through the Balkans , or through Poland or at several points simultaneously . But I can tell you that no matter where and when we strike by land , we and the British and the Russians will hit them from the air heavily and relentlessly . Day in and day out we shall heap tons upon tons of high explosives on their war factories and utilities and seaports . Hitler and Mussolini will understand now the enormity of their miscalculations that the Nazis would always have the advantage of superior air power as they did when they bombed Warsaw , and Rotterdam , and London and Coventry . That superiority has gone forever . Yes , the Nazis and the Fascists have asked for it and they are going to get it . Our forward progress in this war has depended upon our progress on the production front . There has been criticism of the management and conduct of our war production . Much of this self criticism has had a healthy effect . It has spurred us on . It has reflected a normal American impatience to get on with the job . We are the kind of people who are never quite satisfied with anything short of miracles . But there has been some criticism based on guesswork and even on malicious falsification of fact . Such criticism creates doubts and creates fears , and weakens our total effort . I do not wish to suggest that we should be completely satisfied with our production progress today , or next month , or ever . But I can report to you with genuine pride on what has been accomplished in 1942 . A year ago we set certain production goals for 1942 and for 1943 . Some people , including some experts , thought that we had pulled some big figures out of a hat just to frighten the Axis . But we had confidence in the ability of our people to establish new records . And that confidence has been justified . Of course , we realized that some production objectives would have to be changed some of them adjusted upward , and others downward some items would be taken out of the program altogether , and others added . This was inevitable as we gained battle experience , and as technological improvements were made . Our 1942 airplane production and tank production fell short , numerically stress the word numerically of the goals set a year ago . Nevertheless , we have plenty of reason to be proud of our record for 1942 . We produced 48 , 000 military planes more than the airplane production of Germany , Italy , and Japan put together . Last month , in December , we produced 5 , 500 military planes and the rate is rapidly rising . Furthermore , we must remember that as each month passes by , the averages of our types weigh more , take more man hours to make , and have more striking power . In tank production , we revised our schedule and for good and sufficient reasons . As a result of hard experience in battle , we have diverted a portion of our tank producing capacity to a stepped up production of new , deadly field weapons , especially self propelled artillery . Here are some other production figures In 1942 , we produced 56 , 000 combat vehicles , such as tanks and self propelled artillery . In 1942 , we produced 670 , 000 machine guns , six times greater than our production in 1941 and three times greater than our total production during the year and a half of our participation in the first World War . We produced 21 , 000 anti tank guns , six times greater than our 1941 production . We produced ten and a quarter billion rounds of small arms ammunition , five times greater than our 1941 production and three times greater than our total production in the first World War . We produced 181 million rounds of artillery ammunition , 12 times greater than our 1941 production and 10 times greater than our total production in the first World War . I think the arsenal of democracy is making good . These facts and figures that I have given will give no great aid and comfort to the enemy . On the contrary , I can imagine that they will give him considerable discomfort . I suspect that Hitler and Tojo will find it difficult to explain to the German and Japanese people just why it is that decadent , inefficient democracy can produce such phenomenal quantities of weapons and munitions and fighting men . We have given the lie to certain misconceptions , which is an extremely polite word , especially the one which holds that the various blocs or groups within a free country cannot forego their political and economic differences in time of crisis and work together toward a common goal . While we have been achieving this miracle of production , during the past year our armed forces have grown from a little over 2 , 000 , 000 to 7 , 000 , 000 . In other words , we have withdrawn from the labor force and the farms some 5 , 000 , 000 of our younger workers . And in spite of this , our farmers have contributed their share to the common effort by producing the greatest quantity of food ever made available during a single year in all our history . I wonder is there any person among us so simple as to believe that all this could have been done without creating some dislocations in our normal national life , some inconveniences , and even some hardships Who can have hoped to have done this without burdensome government regulations which are a nuisance to everyone including those who have the thankless task of administering them We all know that there have been mistakes mistakes due to the inevitable process of trial and error inherent in doing big things for the first time . We all know that there have been too many complicated forms and questionnaires . I know about that . I have had to fill some of them out myself . But we are determined to see to it that our supplies of food and other essential civilian goods are distributed on a fair and just basis to rich and poor , management and labor , farmer and city dweller alike . We are determined to keep the cost of living at a stable level . All this has required much information . These forms and questionnaires represent an honest and sincere attempt by honest and sincere officials to obtain this information . We have learned by the mistakes that we have made . Our experience will enable us during the coming year to improve the necessary mechanisms of wartime economic controls , and to simplify administrative procedures . But we do not intend to leave things so lax that loopholes will be left for cheaters , for chiselers , or for the manipulators of the black market . Of course , there have been disturbances and inconveniences and even hardships . And there will be many , many more before we finally win . Yes , 1943 will not be an easy year for us on the home front . We shall feel in many ways in our daily lives the sharp pinch of total war . Fortunately , there are only a few Americans who place appetite above patriotism . The overwhelming majority realize that the food we send abroad is for essential military purposes , for our own and Allied fighting forces , and for necessary help in areas that we occupy . We Americans intend to do this great job together . In our common labors we must build and fortify the very foundation of national unity confidence in one another . It is often amusing , and it is sometimes politically profitable , to picture the City of Washington as a madhouse , with the Congress and the administration disrupted with confusion and indecision and general incompetence . However , what matters most in war is results . And the one pertinent fact is that after only a few years of preparation and only one year of warfare , we are able to engage , spiritually as well as physically , in the total waging of a total war . Washington may be a madhouse but only in the sense that it is the capital city of a nation which is fighting mad . And I think that Berlin and Rome and Tokyo , which had such contempt for the obsolete methods of democracy , would now gladly use all they could get of that same brand of madness . And we must not forget that our achievements in production have been relatively no greater than those of the Russians and the British and the Chinese who have developed their own war industries under the incredible difficulties of battle conditions . They have had to continue work through bombings and blackouts . And they have never quit . We Americans are in good , brave company in this war , and we are playing our own , honorable part in the vast common effort . As spokesmen for the United States government , you and I take off our hats to those responsible for our American production to the owners , managers , and supervisors , to the draftsmen and the engineers , and to the workers men and women in factories and arsenals and shipyards and mines and mills and forests and railroads and on highways . We take off our hats to the farmers who have faced an unprecedented task of feeding not only a great nation but a great part of the world . We take off our hats to all the loyal , anonymous , untiring men and women who have worked in private employment and in government and who have endured rationing and other stringencies with good humor and good will . Yes , we take off our hats to all Americans who have contributed so magnificently to our common cause . I have sought to emphasize a sense of proportion in this review of the events of the war and the needs of the war . We should never forget the things we are fighting for . But , at this critical period of the war , we should confine ourselves to the larger objectives and not get bogged down in argument over methods and details . We , and all the United Nations , want a decent peace and a durable peace . In the years between the end of the first World War and the beginning of the second World War , we were not living under a decent or a durable peace . I have reason to know that our boys at the front are concerned with two broad aims beyond the winning of the war and their thinking and their opinion coincide with what most Americans here back home are mulling over . They know , and we know , that it would be inconceivable it would , indeed , be sacrilegious if this nation and the world did not attain some real , lasting good out of all these efforts and sufferings and bloodshed and death . The men in our armed forces want a lasting peace , and , equally , they want permanent employment for themselves , their families , and their neighbors when they are mustered out at the end of the war . Two years ago I spoke in my annual message of four freedoms . The blessings of two of them freedom of speech and freedom of religion are an essential part of the very life of this nation and we hope that these blessings will be granted to all men everywhere . The people at home , and the people at the front , are wondering a little about the third freedom freedom from want . To them it means that when they are mustered out , when war production is converted to the economy of peace , they will have the right to expect full employment full employment for themselves and for all able bodied men and women in America who want to work . They expect the opportunity to work , to run their farms , their stores , to earn decent wages . They are eager to face the risks inherent in our system of free enterprise . They do not want a postwar America which suffers from undernourishment or slums or the dole . They want no get rich quick era of bogus prosperity which will end for them in selling apples on a street corner , as happened after the bursting of the boom in 1929 . When you talk with our young men and our young women , you will find they want to work for themselves and for their families they consider that they have the right to work and they know that after the last war their fathers did not gain that right . When you talk with our young men and women , you will find that with the opportunity for employment they want assurance against the evils of all major economic hazards assurance that will extend from the cradle to the grave . And this great government can and must provide this assurance . I have been told that this is no time to speak of a better America after the war . I am told it is a grave error on my part . I dissent . And if the security of the individual citizen , or the family , should become a subject of national debate , the country knows where I stand . I say this now to this 78th Congress , because it is wholly possible that freedom from want the right of employment , the right of assurance against life s hazards will loom very large as a task of America during the coming two years . I trust it will not be regarded as an issue but rather as a task for all of us to study sympathetically , to work out with a constant regard for the attainment of the objective , with fairness to all and with injustice to none . In this war of survival we must keep before our minds not only the evil things we fight against but the good things we are fighting for . We fight to retain a great past and we fight to gain a greater future . Let us remember , too , that economic safety for the America of the future is threatened unless a greater economic stability comes to the rest of the world . We cannot make America an island in either a military or an economic sense . Hitlerism , like any other form of crime or disease , can grow from the evil seeds of economic as well as military feudalism . Victory in this war is the first and greatest goal before us . Victory in the peace is the next . That means striving toward the enlargement of the security of man here and throughout the world and , finally , striving for the fourth freedom freedom from fear . It is of little account for any of us to talk of essential human needs , of attaining security , if we run the risk of another World War in 10 or 20 or 50 years . That is just plain common sense . Wars grow in size , in death and destruction , and in the inevitability of engulfing all nations , in inverse ratio to the shrinking size of the world as a result of the conquest of the air . I shudder to think of what will happen to humanity , including ourselves , if this war ends in an inconclusive peace , and another war breaks out when the babies of today have grown to fighting age . Every normal American prays that neither he nor his sons nor his grandsons will be compelled to go through this horror again . Undoubtedly a few Americans , even now , think that this nation can end this war comfortably and then climb back into an American hole and pull the hole in after them . But we have learned that we can never dig a hole so deep that it would be safe against predatory animals . We have also learned that if we do not pull the fangs of the predatory animals of this world , they will multiply and grow in strength and they will be at our throats again once more in a short generation . Most Americans realize more clearly than ever before that modern war equipment in the hands of aggressor nations can bring danger overnight to our own national existence or to that of any other nation or island or continent . It is clear to us that if Germany and Italy and Japan or any one of them remain armed at the end of this war , or are permitted to rearm , they will again , and inevitably , embark upon an ambitious career of world conquest . They must be disarmed and kept disarmed , and they must abandon the philosophy , and the teaching of that philosophy , which has brought so much suffering to the world . After the first World War we tried to achieve a formula for permanent peace , based on a magnificent idealism . We failed . But , by our failure , we have learned that we cannot maintain peace at this stage of human development by good intentions alone . Today the United Nations are the mightiest military coalition in all history . They represent an overwhelming majority of the population of the world . Bound together in solemn agreement that they themselves will not commit acts of aggression or conquest against any of their neighbors , the United Nations can and must remain united for the maintenance of peace by preventing any attempt to rearm in Germany , in Japan , in Italy , or in any other nation which seeks to violate the Tenth Commandment Thou shalt not covet . There are cynics , there are skeptics who say it cannot be done . The American people and all the freedom loving peoples of this earth are now demanding that it must be done . And the will of these people shall prevail . The very philosophy of the Axis powers is based on a profound contempt for the human race . If , in the formation of our future policy , we were guided by the same cynical contempt , then we should be surrendering to the philosophy of our enemies , and our victory would turn to defeat . The issue of this war is the basic issue between those who believe in mankind and those who do not the ancient issue between those who put their faith in the people and those who put their faith in dictators and tyrants . There have always been those who did not believe in the people , who attempted to block their forward movement across history , to force them back to servility and suffering and silence . The people have now gathered their strength . They are moving forward in their might and power and no force , no combination of forces , no trickery , deceit , or violence , can stop them now . They see before them the hope of the world a decent , secure , peaceful life for men everywhere . I do not prophesy when this war will end . But I do believe that this year of 1943 will give to the United Nations a very substantial advance along the roads that lead to Berlin and Rome and Tokyo . I tell you it is within the realm of possibility that this 78th Congress may have the historic privilege of helping greatly to save the world from future fear . Therefore , let us all have confidence , let us redouble our efforts . A tremendous , costly , long enduring task in peace as well as in war is still ahead of us . But , as we face that continuing task , we may know that the state of this nation is good the heart of this nation is sound the spirit of this nation is strong the faith of this nation is eternal .<speech_sep>When four years ago we met to inaugurate President , the Republic , single minded in anxiety , stood in spirit here . We dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness . We of the Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it to end by action , tireless and unafraid , the stagnation and despair of that day . We did those first things first . Our covenant with ourselves did not stop there . Instinctively we recognized a deeper need the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever rising problems of a complex civilization . Repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered . For , without that aid , we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind . To do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men . We of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable , to solve problems once considered unsolvable . We would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as , after centuries of fatalistic suffering , we had found a way to master epidemics of disease . We refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster . In this we Americans were discovering no wholly new truth we were writing a new chapter in our book of self government . This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Constitutional Convention which made us a nation . At that Convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the Revolutionary War they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution . A century and a half ago they established the Federal Government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the American people . Today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives . Four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct . They hold out the clear hope that government within communities , government within the separate States , and government of the United States can do the things the times require , without yielding its democracy . Our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday . Nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase , so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil power to do good . The essential democracy of our Nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power , but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections . The Constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent . In fact , in these last four years , we have made the exercise of all power more democratic for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public s government . The legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered . They have been challenged and beaten . Our progress out of the depression is obvious . But that is not all that you and I mean by the new order of things . Our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with second hand materials . By using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations . In that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit . Old truths have been relearned untruths have been unlearned . We have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics . Out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays . We are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world . This new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such . We are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life . In this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned . Hard headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness . We are moving toward an era of good feeling . But we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will . For these reasons I am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of America . Among men of good will , science and democracy together offer an ever richer life and ever larger satisfaction to the individual . With this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order , we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress . Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead Shall we call this the promised land Or , shall we continue on our way For each age is a dream that is dying , or one that is coming to birth . Many voices are heard as we face a great decision . Comfort says , Tarry a while . Opportunism says , This is a good spot . Timidity asks , How difficult is the road ahead True , we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair . Vitality has been preserved . Courage and confidence have been restored . Mental and moral horizons have been extended . But our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstance . Advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering . The times were on the side of progress . To hold to progress today , however , is more difficult . Dulled conscience , irresponsibility , and ruthless self interest already reappear . Such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster Prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose . Let us ask again Have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of March , 1933 Have we found our happy valley I see a great nation , upon a great continent , blessed with a great wealth of natural resources . Its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations . I see a United States which can demonstrate that , under democratic methods of government , national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown , and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence . But here is the challenge to our democracy In this nation I see tens of millions of its citizens a substantial part of its whole population who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life . I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day . I see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so called polite society half a century ago . I see millions denied education , recreation , and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children . I see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions . I see one third of a nation ill housed , ill clad , ill nourished . It is not in despair that I paint you that picture . I paint it for you in hope because the Nation , seeing and understanding the injustice in it , proposes to paint it out . We are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country s interest and concern and we will never regard any faithful , law abiding group within our borders as superfluous . The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little . If I know aught of the spirit and purpose of our Nation , we will not listen to Comfort , Opportunism , and Timidity . We will carry on . Overwhelmingly , we of the Republic are men and women of good will men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well . They will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will . Government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people . It can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts . It can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does . If I know aught of the will of our people , they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained . They will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and , therefore , strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace . Today we reconsecrate our country to long cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization . In every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together . In our personal ambitions we are individualists . But in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation , we all go up , or else we all go down , as one people . To maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods , a vast amount of humility . But out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need . Then political leadership can voice common ideals , and aid in their realization . In taking again the oath of office as President of the United States , I assume the solemn obligation of leading the American people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance . While this duty rests upon me I shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will , seeking Divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace .<speech_sep>I think the American public and the American newspapers are certainly creatures of habit . This is one of the warmest evenings that I have ever felt in Washington , C . , and yet this talk tonight will be referred to as a fireside talk . Our Government , happily , is a democracy . As part of the democratic process , your President is again taking an opportunity to report on the progress of national affairs , to report to the real rulers of this country the voting public . The Seventy Fifth Congress , elected in November , 1936 , on a platform uncompromisingly liberal , has adjourned . Barring unforeseen events , there will be no session until the new Congress , to be elected in November , assembles next January . On the one hand , the Seventy Fifth Congress has left many things undone . For example , it refused to provide more businesslike machinery for running the Executive Branch of the Government . The Congress also failed to meet my suggestion that it take the far reaching steps necessary to put the railroads of the country back on their feet . But , on the other hand , the Congress , striving to carry out the Platform on which most of them were elected , achieved more for the future good of the country than any Congress did between the end of the World War and the spring of 1933 . I mention tonight only the more important of these achievements . 1 The Congress improved still further our agricultural laws to give the farmer a fairer share of the national income , to preserve our soil , to provide an all weather granary , to help the farm tenant towards independence , to find new uses for farm products , and to begin crop insurance . 2 After many requests on my part the Congress passed a Fair Labor Standards Act , what we call the Wages and Hours Bill . That Act applying to products in interstate commerce ends child labor , sets a floor below wages and a ceiling over hours of labor . Except perhaps for the Social Security Act , it is the most far reaching , the most far sighted program for the benefit of workers ever adopted here or in any other country . Without question it starts us toward a better standard of living and increases purchasing power to buy the products of farm and factory . Do not let any calamity howling executive with an income of 1 , 000 . 00 a day , who has been turning his employees over to the Government relief rolls in order to preserve his company s undistributed reserves , tell you using his stockholders money to pay the postage for his personal opinions tell you that a wage of 11 . 00 a week is going to have a disastrous effect on all American industry . Fortunately for business as a whole , and therefore for the Nation , that type of executive is a rarity with whom most business executives most heartily disagree . 3 The Congress has provided a fact finding Commission to find a path through the jungle of contradictory theories about the wise business practices to find the necessary facts for any intelligent legislation on monopoly , on price fixing and on the relationship between big business and medium sized business and little business . Different from a great part of the world , we in America persist in our belief in individual enterprise and in the profit motive but we realize we must continually seek improved practices to insure the continuance of reasonable profits , together with scientific progress , individual initiative , opportunities for the little fellow , fair prices , decent wages and continuing employment . 4 The Congress has coordinated the supervision of commercial aviation and air mail by establishing a new Civil Aeronautics Authority and it has placed all postmasters under the civil service for the first time in our national history . 5 The Congress has set up the United States Housing Administration Authority to help finance large scale slum clearance and provide low rent housing for the low income groups in our cities . And by improving the Federal Housing Act , the Congress has made it easier for private capital to build modest homes and low rental dwellings . 6 The Congress has properly reduced taxes on small corporate enterprises , and has made it easier for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to make credit available to all business . I think the bankers of the country can fairly be expected to participate in loans where the Government , through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation C . , offers to take a fair portion of the risk . 7 So , too , the Congress has provided additional funds for the Works Progress Administration , the Public Works Administration , the Rural Electrification Administration , the Civilian Conservation Corps and other agencies , in order to take care of what we hope is a temporary additional number of unemployed at this time and to encourage production of every kind by private enterprise . All these things together I call our program for the national defense of our economic system . It is a program of balanced action of moving on all fronts at once in intelligent recognition that all of our economic problems , of every group , and of every section of the country are essentially one problem . 8 Finally , because of increasing armaments in other nations and an international situation which is definitely disturbing to all of us , the Congress has authorized important additions to the national armed defense of our shores and our people . On another one other important subject the net result of a struggle in the Congress has been an important victory for the people of the United States what might well be called a lost battle which won a war . You will remember that a year and a half ago , nearly , on February 5 , 1937 , I sent a Message to the Congress dealing with the real need of Federal Court reforms of several kinds . In one way or another , during the sessions of this Congress , the ends I spoke of , the real objectives sought in the that Message , have been substantially attained . The attitude of the Supreme Court towards constitutional questions is entirely changed . Its recent decisions are eloquent testimony of a willingness to collaborate with the two other branches of Government to make democracy work . The Government has been granted the right to protect its interests in litigation between private parties involving the constitutionality of Federal statutes when the constitutionality of Federal statutes is involved , and to appeal directly to the Supreme Court in all cases involving the constitutionality of Federal statutes and no single judge is any longer empowered to suspend a Federal statute on his sole judgment as to its constitutionality . A justice s of the Supreme Court may now retire at the age of seventy after ten years of service , and a substantial number of additional judgeships have been created in order to expedite the trial of cases , and finally greater flexibility has been added to the Federal judicial system by allowing judges to be assigned to congested districts . Another indirect accomplishment of this Congress has been , I think , its response to the devotion of the American people to a course of sane and consistent liberalism . The Congress has understood that under modern conditions Government has a continuing responsibility to meet continuing problems , and that Government cannot take a holiday of a year , or a month , or even a day just because a few people are tired or frightened by the inescapable pace , fast pace , of this modern world in which we live . Some of my opponents and some of my associates have considered that I have a mistakenly sentimental judgment as to the tenacity of purpose and the general level of intelligence of the American people . I am still convinced that the American people , since 1932 , continue to insist on two requisites of private enterprise , and the relationship of Government to it . The first is a complete honesty , a complete honesty at the top in looking after the use of other people s money , and in apportioning and paying individual and corporate taxes according to in accordance with ability to pay . And the second is sincere respect for the need of all people who are at the bottom , all people at the bottom who need to get work and through work to get a really fair share of the good things of life , and a chance to save and a chance to rise . After the election of 1936 I was told , and the Congress was told , by an increasing number of politically and worldly wise people that I should coast along , enjoy an easy Presidency for four years , and not take the Democratic platform too seriously . They told me that people were getting weary of reform through political effort and would no longer oppose that small minority which , in spite of its own disastrous leadership in 1929 , is always eager to resume its control over the Government of the United States . Never in our lifetime has such a concerted campaign of defeatism been thrown at the heads of the President and the Senators and Congressmen as in the case of this Seventy Fifth Congress . Never before have we had so many Copperheads among us and you will remember that it was the Copperheads who , in the days of the Civil War , the War between the States , tried their best to make President Lincoln and his Congress give up the fight in the middle of the fight , to let the Nation remain split in two and return to peace yes , peace at any price . This Congress has ended on the side of the people . My faith in the American people and their faith in themselves have been justified . I congratulate the Congress and the leadership thereof and I congratulate the American people on their own staying power . One word about our economic situation . It makes no difference to me whether you call it a recession or a depression . In 1932 the total national income of all the people in the country had reached the low point of thirty eight billion dollars in that year . With each succeeding year it rose . Last year , 1937 , it had risen to seventy billion dollars despite definitely worse business and agricultural prices in the last four months of last year . This year , 1938 , while it is too early to do more than give an a mere estimate , we hope that the national income will not fall below sixty billion dollars , and that is a lot better than thirty eight billion dollars . We remember also that banking and business and farming are not falling apart like the one hoss shay , as they did in the terrible winter of 1932 to 1933 . Last year mistakes were made by the leaders of private enterprise , by the leaders of labor and by the leaders of Government all three . Last year the leaders of private enterprise pleaded for a sudden curtailment of public spending , and said they would take up the slack . But they made the mistake of increasing their inventories too fast and setting many of their prices too high for their goods to sell . Some labor leaders goaded by decades of oppression of labor made the mistake of going too far . They were not wise in using methods which frightened many well wishing people . They asked employers not only to bargain with them but to put up with jurisdictional disputes at the same time . Government too made mistakes mistakes of optimism in assuming that industry and labor would themselves make no mistakes and Government made a mistake of timing in not passing a farm bill or a wage and hour bill last year . As a result of the lessons of all these mistakes we hope that in the future private enterprise capital and labor alike will operate more intelligently together , and operate in greater cooperation with their own Government than they have in the past . Such cooperation on the part of both of them will be very welcome to me . Certainly at this stage there should be a united stand on the part of both of them to resist wage cuts which would further reduce purchasing power . This afternoon , only a few hours ago , I am told that a great steel company announced a reduction in prices with a view to stimulating business recovery . And I was told , and I am gratified to know , that this reduction in prices has involved no wage cut . Every encouragement ought to be given to industry which accepts the large volume and high wage policy . If this is done throughout the Nation , it ought to result in conditions which will replace a great part of the Government spending which the failure of cooperation has made necessary this year . You will remember that from March 4 , 1933 down to date , not a single week has passed without a cry from the opposition , a small opposition , a cry to do something , to say something , to restore confidence . There is a very articulate group of people in this country , with plenty of ability to procure publicity for their views , who have consistently refused to cooperate with the mass of the people , whether things were going well or going badly , on the ground that they required more concessions to their point of view before they would admit having what they called confidence . These people demanded restoration of confidence when the banks were closed and demanded it again when the banks were reopened . They demanded restoration of confidence when hungry people were thronging the our streets and demanded it again now when the hungry people were fed and put to work . They demanded restoration of confidence when droughts hit the country and demanded it again now when our fields are laden with bounteous yields and excessive crops . They demanded restoration of confidence last year when the automobile industry was running three shifts day and night , turning out more cars than the country could buy and they are demanding it again this year when the industry is trying to get rid of an automobile surplus and has shut down its factories as a result . But , my friends , it is my belief that many of these people who have been crying aloud for confidence are beginning today to realize that that hand has been overplayed , and that they are now willing to talk cooperation instead . It is my belief that the mass of the American people do have confidence in themselves have confidence in their ability , with the aid of Government , to solve their own problems . It is because you are not satisfied , and I am not satisfied , with the progress that we have made in finally solving our business and agricultural and social problems that I believe the great majority of you want your own Government to keep on trying to solve them . In simple frankness and in simple honesty , I need all the help I can get and I see signs of getting more help in the future from many who have fought against progress with tooth and nail in the past . And now following out this line of thought , I want to say a few words about the coming political primaries . Fifty years ago party nominations were generally made in conventions a system typified in the public imagination by a little group in a smoke filled room who made out the party slates . The direct primary was invented to make the nominating process a more democratic one to give the party voters themselves a chance to pick their party candidates . What I am going to say to you tonight does not relate to the primaries of any particular political party , but to matters of principle in all parties Democratic , Republican , Farmer Labor , Progressive , Socialist or any other . Let that be clearly understood . It is my hope that everybody affiliated with any party will vote in the primaries , and that every such voter will consider the fundamental principles for which his or her party is on record . That makes for a healthy choice between the candidates of the opposing parties on Election Day in November . An election cannot give the country a firm sense of direction if it has two or more national parties which merely have different names but are as alike in their principles and aims as peas in the same pod . In the coming primaries in all parties , there will be many clashes between two schools of thought , generally classified as liberal and conservative . Roughly speaking , the liberal school of thought recognizes that the new conditions throughout the world call for new remedies . Those of us in America who hold to this school of thought , insist that these new remedies can be adopted and successfully maintained in this country under our present form of government if we use government as an instrument of cooperation to provide these remedies . We believe that we can solve our problems through continuing effort , through democratic processes instead of Fascism or Communism . We are opposed to the kind of moratorium on reform which , in effect , is means reaction itself . Be it clearly understood , however , that when I use the word liberal , I mean the believer in progressive principles of democratic , representative government and not the wild man who , in effect , leans in the direction of Communism , for that is just as dangerous to us as Fascism itself . The opposing or conservative school of thought , as a general proposition , does not recognize the need for Government itself to step in and take action to meet these new problems . It believes that individual initiative and private philanthropy will solve them that we ought to repeal many of the things we have done and go back , for instance example , to the old gold standard , or stop all this business of old age pensions and unemployment insurance , or repeal the Securities and Exchange Act , or let monopolies thrive unchecked return , in effect , to the kind of Government that we had in the nineteen twenties . Assuming the mental capacity of all the candidates , the important question which it seems to me the primary voter must ask is this To which of these general schools of thought does the candidate belong As President of the United States , I am not asking the voters of the country to vote for Democrats next November as opposed to Republicans or members of any other party . Nor am as President , taking part in Democratic primaries . As the head of the Democratic Party , however , charged with the responsibility of carrying out the definitely liberal declaration of principles set forth in the 1936 Democratic platform , I feel that I have every right to speak in those few instances where there may be a clear cut issue between candidates for a Democratic nomination involving these principles , or involving a clear misuse of my own name . Do not misunderstand me . I certainly would not indicate a preference in a state primary merely because a candidate , otherwise liberal in outlook , had conscientiously differed with me on any single issue . I should be far more concerned about the general attitude of a candidate towards present day problems and his own inward desire to get practical needs attended to in a practical way . We You and I all know that progress may be blocked by outspoken reactionaries , and also but we also know that progress can be blocked by those who say yes to a progressive objective , but who always find some reason to oppose any special specific proposal to gain that objective . I call that type of candidate a yes , but fellow . And I am concerned about the attitude of a candidate or his sponsors with respect to the rights of American citizens to assemble peaceably and to express publicly their views and opinions on important social and economic issues . There can be no constitutional democracy in any community which denies to the individual his freedom to speak and worship as he wishes . The American people will not be deceived by anyone who attempts to suppress individual liberty under the pretense of patriotism . This being a free country with freedom of expression especially with freedom of the press , as is entirely proper there will be a lot of mean blows struck between now and Election Day . By blows I mean misrepresentation and personal attack and appeals to prejudice . It would be a lot better , of course , if campaigns everywhere could be waged with arguments instead of with blows . I hope the liberal candidates will confine themselves to argument and not resort to blows . For in nine cases out of ten the speaker or the writer who , seeking to influence public opinion , descends from calm argument to unfair blows hurts himself more than his opponent . The Chinese have a story on this a story based on three or four thousand years of civilization Two Chinese coolies were arguing heatedly in the midst middle of a crowd in the street . A stranger expressed surprise that no blows were being struck by them . His Chinese friend replied The man who strikes first admits that his ideas have given out . I know that neither in the summer primaries nor in the November elections will the American voters fail to spot the candidate whose ideas have given out .<speech_sep>Declaration of the Three Powers We , The President of the United States , the Prime Minister of Great Britain , and the Premier of the Soviet Union , have met these four days past , in this , the Capital of our ally , Iran , and have shaped and confirmed our common policy . We express our determination that our nations shall work together in war and in the peace that will follow . As to war our military staffs have joined in our round table discussions , and we have concerted our plans for the destruction of the German forces .

Tonight this country faces a serious crisis . We are engaged in a war on the successful outcome of which will depend the whole future of our country . This war has reached a new critical phase . After the years that we have spent in preparation , we have moved into active and continuing battle with our enemies . We are pouring into the worldwide conflict everything that we have our young men , and the vast resources of our nation . I have just returned from a two weeks tour of inspection on which I saw our men being trained and our war materials made . My trip took me through twenty states . I saw thousands of workers on the production line , making airplanes , and guns and ammunition . Everywhere I found great eagerness to get on with the war . Men and women are working long hours at difficult jobs and living under difficult conditions without complaint . Along thousands of miles of track I saw countless acres of newly ploughed fields . The farmers of this country are planting the crops that are needed to feed our armed forces , our civilian population and our Allies . Those crops will be harvested . On my trip , I saw hundreds of thousands of soldiers . Young men who were green recruits last autumn have matured into self assured and hardened fighting men . They are in splendid physical condition . They are mastering the superior weapons that we are pouring out of our factories . The American people have accomplished a miracle . However , all of our massed effort is none too great to meet the demands of this war . We shall need everything that we have and everything that our Allies have to defeat the Nazis and the Fascists in the coming battles on the Continent of Europe , and the Japanese on the Continent of Asia and in the Islands of the Pacific . This tremendous forward movement of the United States and the United Nations cannot be stopped by our enemies . And equally , it must not be hampered by any one individual or by the leaders of any one group here back home . I want to make it clear that every American coal miner who has stopped mining coal no matter how sincere his motives , no matter how legitimate he may believe his grievances to be every idle miner directly and individually is obstructing our war effort . We have not yet won this war . We will win this war only as we produce and deliver our total American effort on the high seas and on the battlefronts . And that requires unrelenting , uninterrupted effort here on the home front . A stopping of the coal supply , even for a short time , would involve a gamble with the lives of American soldiers and sailors and the future security of our whole people . It would involve an unwarranted , unnecessary and terribly dangerous gamble with our chances for victory . Therefore , I say to all miners and to all Americans everywhere , at home and abroad the production of coal will not be stopped . Tonight , I am speaking to the essential patriotism of the miners , and to the patriotism of their wives and children . And I am going to state the true facts of this case as simply and as plainly as I know how . After the attack at Pearl Harbor , the three great labor organizations the American Federation of Labor , the Congress of Industrial Organizations , and the Railroad Brotherhoods gave the positive assurance that there would be no strikes as long as the war lasted . And the President of the United Mine workers of America was a party to that assurance . That pledge was applauded throughout the country . It was a forcible means of telling the world that we Americans 135 , 000 , 000 of us are united in our determination to fight this total war with our total will and our total power . At the request of employers and of organized labor including the United Mine Workers the War Labor Board was set up for settling any disputes which could not be adjusted through collective bargaining . The War Labor Board is a tribunal on which workers , employers and the general public are equally represented . In the present coal crisis , conciliation and mediation were tried unsuccessfully . In accordance with the law , the case was then certified to the War Labor Board , the agency created for this express purpose with the approval of organized labor . The members of the Board followed the usual practice , which has proved successful in other disputes . Acting promptly , they undertook to get all the facts of this the case from both the miners and the operators . The national officers of the United Mine Workers , however , declined to have anything to do with the fact finding of the War Labor Board . The only excuse that they offer is that the War Labor Board is prejudiced . The War Labor Board has been and is ready to give this the case a fair and impartial hearing . And I have given my assurance that if any adjustment of wages is made by the Board , it will be made retroactive to April first . But the national officers Of the United Mine Workers refused to participate in the hearing , when asked to do so last Monday . On Wednesday of this past week , while the Board was proceeding with the case , stoppages began to occur in some mines . On Thursday morning I telegraphed to the officers of the United Mine Workers asking that the miners continue mining coal on Saturday morning . However , a general strike throughout the industry became effective on Friday night . The responsibility for the crisis that we now face rests squarely on these national officers of the United Mine Workers , and not on the Government of the United States . But the consequences of this arbitrary action threaten all of us everywhere . At ten of the clock , yesterday morning Saturday the Government took over the mines . I called upon the miners to return to work for their Government . The Government needs their services just as surely as it needs the services of our soldiers , and sailors , and marines and the services of the millions who are turning out the munitions of war . You miners have sons in the Army and Navy and Marine Corps . You have sons who at this very minute this split second may be fighting in New Guinea , or in the Aleutian Islands , or Guadalcanal , or Tunisia , or China , or protecting troop ships and supplies against submarines on the high seas . We have already received telegrams from some of our fighting men overseas , and I only wish they could tell you what they think of the stoppage of work in the coal mines . Some of your own sons have come back from the fighting fronts , wounded . A number of them , for example , are now here in an Army hospital in Washington . Several of them have been decorated by their Government . I could tell you of one from Pennsylvania . He was a coal miner before his induction , and his father is a coal miner . He was seriously wounded by Nazi machine gun bullets while he was on a bombing mission over Europe in a Flying Fortress . Another boy , from Kentucky , the son of a coal miner , was wounded when our troops first landed in North Africa six months ago . There is still another , from Illinois . He was a coal miner his father and two brothers are coal miners . He was seriously wounded in Tunisia while attempting to rescue two comrades whose jeep had been blown up by a Nazi mine . These men do not consider themselves heroes . They would probably be embarrassed if I mentioned their names over the air . They were wounded in the line of duty . They know how essential it is to the tens of thousands hundreds of thousands and ultimately millions of other young Americans to get the best of arms and equipment into the hands of our fighting forces and get them there quickly . The fathers and mothers of our fighting men , their brothers and sisters and friends and that includes all of us are also in the line of duty the production line . Any failure in production may well result in costly defeat on the field of battle . There can be no one among us no one faction powerful enough to interrupt the forward march of our people to victory . You miners have ample reason to know that there are certain basic rights for which this country stands , and that those rights are worth fighting for and worth dying for . That is why you have sent your sons and brothers from every mining town in the nation to join in the great struggle overseas . That is why you have contributed so generously , so willingly , to the purchase of war bonds and to the many funds for the relief of war victims in foreign lands . That is why , since this war was started in 1939 , you have increased the annual production of coal by almost two hundred million tons a year . The toughness of your sons in our armed forces is not surprising . They come of fine , rugged stock . Men who work in the mines are not unaccustomed to hardship . It has been the objective of this Government to reduce that hardship , to obtain for miners and for all who do the nation s work a better standard of living . I know only too well that the cost of living is troubling the miners families , and troubling the families of millions of other workers throughout the country as well . A year ago it became evident to all of us that something had to be done about living costs . Your Government determined not to let the cost of living continue to go up as it did in the first World War . Your Government has been determined to maintain stability of both prices and wages so that a dollar would buy , so far as possible , the same amount of the necessities of life . And by necessities I mean just that not the luxuries , not the and fancy goods that we have learned to do without in wartime . So far , we have not been able to keep the prices of some necessities as low as we should have liked to keep them . That is true not only in coal towns but in many other places . Wherever we find that prices of essentials have risen too high , they will be brought down . Wherever we find that price ceilings are being violated , the violators will be punished . Rents have been fixed in most parts of the country . In many cities they have been cut to below where they were before we entered the war . Clothing prices have generally remained stable . These two items make up more than a third of the total budget of the worker s family . As for food , which today accounts for about another a third of the family expenditure on the average , I want to repeat again your Government will continue to take all necessary measures to eliminate unjustified and avoidable price increases . And we are today now taking measures to roll back the prices of meats . The war is going to go on . Coal will be mined no matter what any individual thinks about it . The operation of our factories , our power plants , our railroads will not be stopped . Our munitions must move to our troops . And so , under these circumstances , it is inconceivable that any patriotic miner can choose any course other than going back to work and mining coal . The nation cannot afford violence of any kind at the coal mines or in coal towns . I have placed authority for the resumption of coal mining in the hands of a civilian , the Secretary of the Interior . If it becomes necessary to protect any miner who seeks patriotically to go back and work , then that miner must have and his family must have and will have complete and adequate protection . If it becomes necessary to have troops at the mine mouths or in coal towns for the protection of working miners and their families , those troops will be doing police duty for the sake of the nation as a whole , and particularly for the sake of the fighting men in the Army , the Navy and the Marines your sons and mine who are fighting our common enemies all over the world . I understand the devotion of the coal miners to their union . I know of the sacrifices they have made to build it up . I believe now , as I have all my life , in the right of workers to join unions and to protect their unions . I want to make it absolutely clear that this Government is not going to do anything now to weaken those rights in the coalfields . Every improvement in the conditions of the coal miners of this country has had my hearty support , and I do not mean to desert them now . But I also do not mean to desert my obligations and responsibilities as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy . The first necessity is the resumption of coal mining . The terms of the old contract will be followed by the Secretary of the Interior . If an adjustment in wages results from a decision of the War Labor Board , or from any new agreement between the operators and miners , which is approved by the War Labor Board , that adjustment will be made retroactive to April first . In the message that I delivered to the Congress four months ago , I expressed my conviction that the spirit of this nation is good . Since then , I have seen our troops in the Caribbean area , in bases on the coasts of our ally , Brazil , and in North Africa . Recently I have again seen great numbers of our fellow countrymen soldiers and civilians from the Atlantic Seaboard to the Mexican border and to the Rocky Mountains . Tonight , in the fact of a crisis of serious proportions in the coal industry , I say again that the spirit or this nation is good . I know that the American people will not tolerate any threat offered to their Government by anyone . I believe the coal miners will not continue the strike against their the Government . I believe that the coal miners themselves as Americans will not fail to heed the clear call to duty . Like all other good Americans , they will march shoulder to shoulder with their armed forces to victory . Tomorrow the Stars and Stripes will fly over the coal mines , and I hope that every miner will be at work under that flag .<speech_sep>Ladies and Gentlemen All our fighting men overseas today have their appointed stations on the far flung battlefronts of the world . We at home have ours too . We need , we and are proud of , our fighting men most decidedly . But , during the anxious times ahead , let us not forget that they need us too . It goes almost without saying that we must continue to forge the weapons of victory the hundreds of thousands of items , large and small , essential to the waging of the war . This has been the major task from the very start , and it is still a major task . This is the very worst time for any war worker to think of leaving his machine or to look for a peacetime job . And it goes almost without saying , too , that we must continue to provide our Government with the funds necessary for waging war not only by the payment of taxes which , after all , is an obligation of American citizenship but also by the purchase of War Bonds an act of free choice which every citizen has to make for himself under the guidance of his own conscience . Whatever else any of us may be doing , the purchase of War Bonds and stamps is something all of us can do and should do to help win the war . I am happy to report tonight that it is something which something nearly everyone seems to be doing . Although there are now approximately sixty seven million persons who have or earn some form of income including the armed forces , eighty one million persons or their children have already bought war bonds . They have bought more than six hundred million individual bonds . Their purchases have totaled more than thirty two billion dollars . These are the purchases of individual men , women and children . Anyone who would have said this was possible a few years ago would have been put down as a starry eyed visionary . But of such visions however is the stuff of America fashioned . Of course , there are always pessimists with us everywhere , a few here and a few there . I am reminded of the fact that after the fall of France in 1940 I asked the Congress for the money for the production by the United States of fifty thousand airplanes per year . Well , I was called crazy it was said that the figure was fantastic that it could not be done . And yet today we are building airplanes at the rate of one hundred thousand a year . There is a direct connection between the bonds you have bought and the stream of men and equipment now rushing over the English Channel for the liberation of Europe . There is a direct connection between your War Bonds and every part of this global war today . Tonight , therefore on the opening of this Fifth War Loan Drive , it is appropriate for us to take a broad look at this panorama of world war , for the success or the failure of the drive is going to have so much to do with the speed with which we can accomplish victory and the peace . While I know that the chief interest tonight is centered on the English Channel and on the beaches and farms and the cities of Normandy , we should not lose sight of the fact that our armed forces are engaged on other battlefronts all over the world , and that no one front can be considered alone without its proper relation to all . It is worth while , therefore , to make over all comparisons with the past . Let us compare today with just two years ago June , 1942 . At that time Germany was in control of practically all of Europe , and was steadily driving the Russians back toward the Ural Mountains . Germany was practically in control of North Africa and the Mediterranean , and was beating at the gates of the Suez Canal and the route to India . Italy was still an important military and supply factor as subsequent , long campaigns have proved . Japan was in control of the western Aleutian Islands and in the South Pacific was knocking at the gates of Australia and New Zealand and also was threatening India . Japan she had seized control of nearly one half of the Central Pacific . American armed forces on land and sea and in the air were still very definitely on the defensive , and in the building up stage . Our Allies were bearing the heat and the brunt of the attack . In 1942 Washington heaved a sigh of relief that the first War Bond issue had been cheerfully over subscribed by the American people . Way back in those days , two years ago , America was still hearing from many amateur strategists and political critics , some of whom were doing more good for Hitler than for the United States two years ago . But today we are on the offensive all over the world bringing the attack to our enemies . In the Pacific , by relentless submarine and naval attacks , and amphibious thrusts , and ever mounting air attacks , we have deprived the Japs of the power to check the momentum of our ever growing and ever advancing military forces . We have reduced the Japs their shipping by more than three million tons . We have overcome their original advantage in the air . We have cut off from a return to the homeland , cut off from that return , tens of thousands of beleaguered Japanese troops who now face starvation or ultimate surrender . And we have cut down their naval strength , so that for many months they have avoided all risk of encounter with our naval forces . True , we still have a long way to go to Tokyo . But , carrying out our original strategy of eliminating our European enemy first and then turning all our strength to the Pacific , we can force the Japanese to unconditional surrender or to national suicide much more rapidly than has been thought possible . Turning now to our enemy who is first on the list for destruction Germany has her back against the wall in fact three walls at once In the south we have broken the German hold on central Italy . On June fourth , the city of Rome fell to the Allied armies . And allowing the enemy no respite , the Allies are now pressing hard on the heels of the Germans as they retreat northwards in ever growing confusion . On the east our gallant Soviet Allies have driven the enemy back from the lands which were invaded three years ago . The great Soviet armies are now initiating crushing blows . Overhead vast Allied air fleets of bombers and fighters have been waging a bitter air war over Germany and Western Europe . They have had two major objectives to destroy German war industries which maintain the German armies and air forces and to shoot the German Luftwaffe out of the air . As a result German production has been whittled down continuously , and the German fighter forces now have has only a fraction of their its former power . This great air campaign , strategic and tactical , is going to will continue with increasing power . And on the west the hammer blow which struck the coast of France last Tuesday morning , less than a week ago , was the culmination of many months of careful planning and strenuous preparation . Millions of tons of weapons and supplies , and hundreds of thousands of men assembled in England , are now being poured into the great battle in Europe . I think that from the standpoint of our enemy we have achieved the impossible . We have broken through their supposedly impregnable wall in Northern France . But the assault has been costly in men and costly in materials . Some of our landings were desperate adventures but from advices received so far , the losses were lower than our commanders had estimated would occur . We have established a firm foothold . We and are now prepared to meet the inevitable counter attacks of the Germans with power and with confidence . And we all pray that we will have far more , soon , than a firm foothold . Americans have all worked together to make this day possible . The liberation forces now streaming across the Channel , and up the beaches and through the fields and the forests down the highways of France are using thousands and thousands of planes and ships and tanks and heavy guns . They are carrying with them many thousands of items needed for their dangerous , stupendous undertaking . There is a shortage of nothing nothing And this must continue . What has been done in the United States since those days of 1940 when France fell in raising and equipping and transporting our fighting forces , and in producing weapons and supplies for war , has been nothing short of a miracle . It was largely due to American teamwork teamwork among capital and labor and agriculture , between the armed forces and the civilian economy indeed among all of them . And every one every man or woman or child who bought a War Bond helped and helped mightily There are still many people in the United States who have not bought War Bonds , or who have not bought as many as they can afford . Everyone knows for himself whether he falls into that category or not . In some cases his neighbors know too also . To the consciences of those people , this appeal by the President of the United States is very much in order . For all of the things which we use in this war , everything we send to our fighting Allies , costs money a lot of money . One sure way every man , woman and child can keep faith with those who have given , and are giving , their lives , is to provide the money which is needed to win the final victory . I urge all Americans to buy War Bonds without stint . Swell the mighty chorus to bring us nearer to victory<speech_sep>President , Speaker , members of the 77th Congress I address you , the members of the 77th Congress , at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union . I use the word unprecedented , because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today . Since the permanent formation of our government under the Constitution , in 1789 , most of the periods of crisis in our history have related to our domestic affairs . Fortunately , only one of these the four year War Between the States ever threatened our national unity . Today , thank God , 130 million Americans , in 48 states , have forgotten points of the compass in our national unity . It is true that prior to 1914 the United States often had been disturbed by events in other continents . We had even engaged in two wars with European nations and in a number of undeclared wars in the West Indies , in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific for the maintenance of American rights and for the principles of peaceful commerce . But in no case had a serious threat been raised against our national safety or our continued independence . What I seek to convey is the historic truth that the United States as a nation has at all times maintained clear , definite opposition , to any attempt to lock us in behind an ancient Chinese wall while the procession of civilization went past . Today , thinking of our children and of their children , we oppose enforced isolation for ourselves or for any other part of the Americas . That determination of ours , extending over all these years , was proved , for example , during the quarter century of wars following the French Revolution . While the Napoleonic struggles did threaten interests of the United States because of the French foothold in the West Indies and in Louisiana , and while we engaged in the War of 1812 to vindicate our right to peaceful trade , it is nevertheless clear that neither France nor Great Britain , nor any other nation , was aiming at domination of the whole world . In like fashion from 1815 to 1914 99 years no single war in Europe or in Asia constituted a real threat against our future or against the future of any other American nation . Except in the Maximilian interlude in Mexico , no foreign power sought to establish itself in this Hemisphere and the strength of the British fleet in the Atlantic has been a friendly strength . It is still a friendly strength . Even when the World War broke out in 1914 , it seemed to contain only small threat of danger to our own American future . But , as time went on , the American people began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own democracy . We need not overemphasize imperfections in the Peace of Versailles . We need not harp on failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction . We should remember that the Peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kind of pacification which began even before Munich , and which is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to spread over every continent today . The American people have unalterably set their faces against that tyranny . Every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part of the world assailed either by arms , or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations that are still at peace . During 16 long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations , great and small . The assailants are still on the march , threatening other nations , great and small . Therefore , as your President , performing my constitutional duty to give to the Congress information of the state of the Union , I find it , unhappily , necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders . Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents . If that defense fails , all the population and all the resources of Europe , Asia , Africa , and Australasia will be dominated by the conquerors . Let us remember that the total of those populations and their resources in those four continents greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere many times over . In times like these it is immature and incidentally , untrue for anybody to brag that an unprepared America , single handed , and with one hand tied behind its back , can hold off the whole world . No realistic American can expect from a dictator s peace international generosity , or return of true independence , or world disarmament , or freedom of expression , or freedom of religion , or even good business . Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors . Those , who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . As a nation , we may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted but we cannot afford to be soft headed . We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the ism of appeasement . We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests . I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war . There is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas . Obviously , as long as the British Navy retains its power , no such danger exists . Even if there were no British Navy , it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing troops in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean , until it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate . But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe particularly the lesson of Norway , whose essential seaports were captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years . The first phase of the invasion of this Hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troops . The necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and their dupes and great numbers of them are already here , and in Latin America . As long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive , they not we will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack . That is why the future of all the American republics is today in serious danger . That is why this annual message to the Congress is unique in our history . That is why every member of the executive branch of the government and every member of the Congress faces great responsibility and great accountability . The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily almost exclusively to meeting this foreign peril . For all our domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency . Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within our gates , so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a decent respect for the rights and dignity of all nations , large and small . And the justice of morality must and will win in the end . Our national policy is this First , by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship , we are committed to all inclusive national defense . Second , by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship , we are committed to full support of all those resolute peoples , everywhere , who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our hemisphere . By this support , we express our determination that the democratic cause shall prevail and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation . Third , by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship , we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers . We know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people s freedom . In the recent national election there was no substantial difference between the two great parties in respect to that national policy . No issue was fought out on this line before the American electorate . Today it is abundantly evident that American citizens everywhere are demanding and supporting speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger . Therefore , the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production . Leaders of industry and labor have responded to our summons . Goals of speed have been set . In some cases these goals are being reached ahead of time in some cases we are on schedule in other cases there are slight but not serious delays and in some cases and I am sorry to say very important cases we are all concerned by the slowness of the accomplishment of our plans . The Army and Navy , however , have made substantial progress during the past year . Actual experience is improving and speeding up our methods of production with every passing day . And today s best is not good enough for tomorrow . I am not satisfied with the progress thus far made . The men in charge of the program represent the best in training , in ability , and in patriotism . They are not satisfied with the progress thus far made . None of us will be satisfied until the job is done . No matter whether the original goal was set too high or too low , our objective is quicker and better results . To give you two illustrations We are behind schedule in turning out finished airplanes we are working day and night to solve the innumerable problems and to catch up . We are ahead of schedule in building warships but we are working to get even further ahead of that schedule . To change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implements of peace to a basis of wartime production of implements of war is no small task . And the greatest difficulty comes at the beginning of the program , when new tools , new plant facilities , new assembly lines , and new ship ways must first be constructed before the actual materiel begins to flow steadily and speedily from them . The Congress , of course , must rightly keep itself informed at all times of the progress of the program . However , there is certain information , as the Congress itself will readily recognize , which , in the interests of our own security and those of the nations that we are supporting , must of needs be kept in confidence . New circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety . I shall ask this Congress for greatly increased new appropriations and authorizations to carry on what we have begun . I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds , to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations . Our most useful and immediate role is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves . They do not need man power , but they do need billions of dollars worth of the weapons of defense . The time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash . We cannot , and we will not , tell them that they must surrender , merely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we know they must have . I do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay for these weapons a loan to be repaid in dollars . I recommend that we make it possible for those nations to continue to obtain war materials in the United States , fitting their orders into our own program . Nearly all their materiel would , if the time ever came , be useful for our own defense . Taking counsel of expert military and naval authorities , considering what is best for our own security , we are free to decide how much should be kept here and how much should be sent abroad to our friends who by their determined and heroic resistance are giving us time in which to make ready our own defense . For what we send abroad , we shall be repaid within a reasonable time following the close of hostilities , in similar materials , or , at our option , in other goods of many kinds , which they can produce and which we need . Let us say to the democracies We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom . We are putting forth our energies , our resources and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world . We shall send you , in ever increasing numbers , ships , planes , tanks , guns . This is our purpose and our pledge . In fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their aggression . Such aid is not an act of war , even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be . When the dictators , if the dictators , are ready to make war upon us , they will not wait for an act of war on our part . They did not wait for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war . Their only interest is in a new one way international law , which lacks mutuality in its observance , and , therefore , becomes an instrument of oppression . The happiness of future generations of Americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt . No one can tell the exact character of the emergency situations that we may be called upon to meet . The nation s hands must not be tied when the nation s life is in danger . We must all prepare to make the sacrifices that the emergency almost as serious as war itself demands . Whatever stands in the way of speed and efficiency in defense preparations must give way to the national need . A free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups . A free nation has the right to look to the leaders of business , of labor , and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort , not among other groups but within their own groups . The best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble makers in our midst is , first , to shame them by patriotic example , and , if that fails , to use the sovereignty of government to save government . As men do not live by bread alone , they do not fight by armaments alone . Those who man our defenses , and those behind them who build our defenses , must have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are defending . The mighty action that we are calling for cannot be based on a disregard of all things worth fighting for . The nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in America . Those things have toughened the fibre of our people , have renewed their faith and strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make ready to protect . Certainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social and economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution which is today a supreme factor in the world . For there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy . The basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple . They are Equality of opportunity for youth and for others . Jobs for those who can work . Security for those who need it . The ending of special privilege for the few . The preservation of civil liberties for all . The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living . These are the simple , basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world . The inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations . Many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement . As examples We should bring more citizens under the coverage of old age pensions and unemployment insurance . We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care . We should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it . I have called for personal sacrifice . I am assured of the willingness of almost all Americans to respond to that call . A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes . In my budget message I shall recommend that a greater portion of this great defense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying today . No person should try , or be allowed , to get rich out of this program and the principle of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eyes to guide our legislation . If the Congress maintains these principles , the voters , putting patriotism ahead of pocketbooks , will give you their applause . In the future days , which we seek to make secure , we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms . The first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world . The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way everywhere in the world . The third is freedom from want which , translated into world terms , means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants everywhere in the world . The fourth is freedom from fear which , translated into world terms , means a world wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world . That is no vision of a distant millennium . It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation . That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb . To that new order we oppose the greater conception the moral order . A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear . Since the beginning of our American history , we have been engaged in change in a perpetual peaceful revolution a revolution which goes on steadily , quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quick lime in the ditch . The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries , working together in a friendly , civilized society . This nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God . Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere . Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them . Our strength is our unity of purpose . To that high concept there can be no end save victory .<speech_sep>
