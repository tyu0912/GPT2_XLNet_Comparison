I have been on a journey of husbandry . I went primarily to see at first hand conditions in the drought states to see how effectively Federal and local authorities are taking care of pressing problems of relief and also how they are to work together to defend the people of this country against the effects of future droughts . I saw drought devastation in nine states . I talked with families who had lost their wheat crop , lost their corn crop , lost their livestock , lost the water in their well , lost their garden and come through to the end of the summer without one dollar of cash resources , facing a winter without feed or food facing a planting season without seed to put in the ground . That was the extreme case , but there are thousands and thousands of families on western farms who share the same difficulties . I saw cattlemen who because of lack of grass or lack of winter feed have been compelled to sell all but their breeding stock and will need help to carry even these through the coming winter . I saw livestock kept alive only because water had been brought to them long distances in tank cars . I saw other farm families who have not lost everything but who , because they have made only partial crops , must have some form of help if they are to continue farming next spring . I shall never forget the fields of wheat so blasted by heat that they cannot be harvested . I shall never forget field after field of corn stunted , earless and stripped of leaves , for what the sun left the grasshoppers took . I saw brown pastures which would not keep a cow on fifty acres . Yet I would not have you think for a single minute that there is permanent disaster in these drought regions , or that the picture I saw meant depopulating these areas . No cracked earth , no blistering sun , no burning wind , no grasshoppers , are a permanent match for the indomitable American farmers and stockmen and their wives and children who have carried on through desperate days , and inspire us with their self reliance , their tenacity and their courage . It was their fathers task to make homes it is their task to keep those homes it is our task to help them with their fight . First let me talk for a minute about this autumn and the coming winter . We have the option , in the case of families who need actual subsistence , of putting them on the dole or putting them to work . They do not want to go on the dole and they are one thousand percent right . We agree , therefore , that we must put them to work for a decent wage , and when we reach that decision we kill two birds with one stone , because these families will earn enough by working , not only to subsist themselves , but to buy food for their stock , and seed for next year s planting . Into this scheme of things there fit of course the government lending agencies which next year , as in the past , will help with production loans . Every Governor with whom I have talked is in full accord with this program of doing work for these farm families , just as every Governor agrees that the individual states will take care of their unemployables but that the cost of employing those who are entirely able and willing to work must be borne by the Federal Government . If then we know , as we do today , the approximate number of farm families who will require some form of work relief from now on through the winter , we face the question of what kind of work they should do . Let me make it clear that this is not a new question because it has already been answered to a greater or less extent in every one of the drought communities . Beginning in 1934 , when we also had serious drought conditions , the state and Federal governments cooperated in planning a large number of projects many of them directly aimed at the alleviation of future drought conditions . In accordance with that program literally thousands of ponds or small reservoirs have been built in order to supply water for stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect wells from going dry . Thousands of wells have been drilled or deepened community lakes have been created and irrigation projects are being pushed . Water conservation by means such as these is being expanded as a result of this new drought all through the Great Plains area , the western corn belt and in the states that lie further south . In the Middle West water conservation is not so pressing a problem . Here the work projects run more to soil erosion control and the building of farm to market roads . Spending like this is not waste . It would spell future waste if we did not spend for such things now . These emergency work projects provide money to buy food and clothing for the winter they keep the livestock on the farm they provide seed for a new crop , and , best of all , they will conserve soil and water in the future in those areas most frequently hit by drought . If , for example , in some local area the water table continues to drop and the topsoil to blow away , the land values will disappear with the water and the soil . People on the farms will drift into the nearby cities the cities will have no farm trade and the workers in the city factories and stores will have no jobs . Property values in the cities will decline . If , on the other hand , the farms within that area remain as farms with better water supply and no erosion , the farm population will stay on the land and prosper and the nearby cities will prosper too . Property values will increase instead of disappearing . That is why it is worth our while as a nation to spend money in order to save money . I have , however , used the argument in relation only to a small area it holds good in its effect on the nation as a whole . Every state in the drought area is now doing and always will do business with every state outside it . The very existence of the men and women working in the clothing factories of New York , making clothes worn by farmers and their families of the workers in the steel mills in Pittsburgh , in the automobile factories of Detroit , and in the harvester factories of Illinois , depend upon the farmers ability to purchase the commodities they produce . In the same way it is the purchasing power of the workers in these factories in the cities that enables them and their wives and children to eat more beef , more pork , more wheat , more corn , more fruit and more dairy products , and to buy more clothing made from cotton , wool and leather . In a physical and a property sense , as well as in a spiritual sense , we are members one of another . I want to make it clear that no simple panacea can be applied to the drought problem in the whole of the drought area . Plans must depend on local conditions , for these vary with annual rainfall , soil characteristics , altitude and topography . Water and soil conservation methods may differ in one county from those in an adjoining county . Work to be done in the cattle and sheep country differs in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn belt . The Great Plains Drought Area Committee has given me its preliminary recommendations for a long time program for that region . Using that report as a basis we are cooperating successfully and in entire accord with the Governors and state planning boards . As we get this program into operation the people more and more will be able to maintain themselves securely on the land . That will mean a steady decline in the relief burdens which the Federal Government and states have had to assume in time of drought but , more important , it will mean a greater contribution to general national prosperity by these regions which have been hit by drought . It will conserve and improve not only property values , but human values . The people in the drought area do not want to be dependent on Federal , state or any other kind of charity . They want for themselves and their families an opportunity to share fairly by their own efforts in the progress of America . The farmers of America want a sound national agricultural policy in which a permanent land use program will have an important place . They want assurance against another year like 1932 when they made good crops but had to sell them for prices that meant ruin just as surely as did the drought . Sound policy must maintain farm prices in good crop years as well as in bad crop years . It must function when we have drought it must also function when we have bumper crops . The maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm prices and the prices of industrial products is an aim which we must keep ever before us , just as we must give constant thought to the sufficiency of the food supply of the nation even in bad years . Our modern civilization can and should devise a more successful means by which the excess supplies of bumper years can be conserved for use in lean years . On my trip I have been deeply impressed with the general efficiency of those agencies of the Federal , state and local governments which have moved in on the immediate task created by the drought . In 1934 none of us had preparation we worked without blueprints and made the mistakes of inexperience . Hindsight shows us this . But as time has gone on we have been making fewer and fewer mistakes . Remember that the Federal and state governments have done only broad planning . Actual work on a given project originates in the local community . Local needs are listed from local information . Local projects are decided on only after obtaining the recommendations and help of those in the local community who are best able to give it . And it is worthy of note that on my entire trip , though I asked the question dozens of times , I heard no complaint against the character of a single works relief project . The elected heads of the states concerned , together with their state officials and their experts from agricultural colleges and state planning boards , have shown cooperation with and approval of the work which the Federal Government has headed up . I am grateful also to the men and women in all these states who have accepted leadership in the work in their locality . In the drought area people are not afraid to use new methods to meet changes in Nature , and to correct mistakes of the past . If overgrazing has injured range lands , they are willing to reduce the grazing . If certain wheat lands should be returned to pasture they are willing to cooperate . If trees should be planted as windbreaks or to stop erosion they will work with us . If terracing or summer fallowing or crop rotation is called for , they will carry them out . They stand ready to fit , and not to fight , the ways of Nature . We are helping , and shall continue to help the farmer to do those things , through local soil conservation committees and other cooperative local , state and federal agencies of government . I have not the time tonight to deal with other and more comprehensive agricultural policies . With this fine help we are tiding over the present emergency . We are going to conserve soil , conserve water and conserve life . We are going to have long time defenses against both low prices and drought . We are going to have a farm policy that will serve the national welfare . That is our hope for the future . There are two reasons why I want to end by talking about reemployment . Tomorrow is Labor Day . The brave spirit with which so many millions of working people are winning their way out of depression deserves respect and admiration . It is like the courage of the farmers in the drought areas . That is my first reason . The second is that healthy employment conditions stand equally with healthy agricultural conditions as a buttress of national prosperity . Dependable employment at fair wages is just as important to the people in the towns and cities as good farm income is to agriculture . Our people must have the ability to buy the goods they manufacture and the crops they produce . Thus city wages and farm buying power are the two strong legs that carry the nation forward . Re employment in industry is proceeding rapidly . Government spending was in large part responsible for keeping industry going and putting it in a position to make this reemployment possible . Government orders were the backlog of heavy industry government wages turned over and over again to make consumer purchasing power and to sustain every merchant in the community . Businessmen with their businesses , small and large , had to be saved . Private enterprise is necessary to any nation which seeks to maintain the democratic form of government . In their case , just as certainly as in the case of drought stricken farmers , government spending has saved . Government having spent wisely to save it , private industry begins to take workers off the rolls of the government relief program . Until this Administration we had no free employment service , except in a few states and cities . Because there was no unified employment service , the worker , forced to move as industry moved , often travelled over the country , wandering after jobs which seemed always to travel just a little faster than he did . He was often victimized by fraudulent practices of employment clearing houses , and the facts of employment opportunities were at the disposal neither of himself nor of the employer . In 1933 the United States Employment Service was created a cooperative state and Federal enterprise , through which the Federal Government matches dollar for dollar the funds provided by the states for registering the occupations and skills of workers and for actually finding jobs for these registered workers in private industry . The Federal State cooperation has been splendid . Already employment services are operating in 32 states , and the areas not covered by them are served by the Federal Government . We have developed a nationwide service with seven hundred District offices , and one thousand branch offices , thus providing facilities through which labor can learn of jobs available and employers can find workers . Last Spring I expressed the hope that employers would realize their deep responsibility to take men off the relief rolls and give them jobs in private enterprise . Subsequently I was told by many employers that they were not satisfied with the information available concerning the skill and experience of the workers on the relief rolls . On August 25th I allocated a relatively small sum to the employment service for the purpose of getting better and more recent information in regard to those now actively at work on WPA Projects information as to their skills and previous occupations and to keep the records of such men and women up to date for maximum service in making them available to industry . Tonight I am announcing the allocation of two and a half million dollars more to enable the Employment Service to make an even more intensive search then it has yet been equipped to make , to find opportunities in private employment for workers registered with it . Tonight I urge the workers to cooperate with and take full advantage of this intensification of the work of the Employment Service . This does not mean that there will be any lessening of our efforts under our WPA and PWA and other work relief programs until all workers have decent jobs in private employment at decent wages . We do not surrender our responsibility to the unemployed . We have had ample proof that it is the will of the American people that those who represent them in national , state and local government should continue as long as necessary to discharge that responsibility . But it does mean that the government wants to use resource to get private work for those now employed on government work , and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditures for direct employment . Tonight I ask employers , large and small , throughout the nation , to use the help of the state and Federal Employment Service whenever in the general pick up of business they require more workers . Tomorrow is Labor Day . Labor Day in this country has never been a class holiday . It has always been a national holiday . It has never had more significance as a national holiday than it has now . In other countries the relationship of employer and employee has more or less been accepted as a class relationship not readily to be broken through . In this country we insist , as an essential of the American way of life , that the employer employee relationship should be one between free men and equals . We refuse to regard those who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to those who live from their property . We insist that labor is entitled to as much respect as property . But our workers with hand and brain deserve more than respect for their labor . They deserve practical protection in the opportunity to use their labor at a return adequate to support them at a decent and constantly rising standard of living , and to accumulate a margin of security against the inevitable vicissitudes of life . The average man must have that twofold opportunity if we are to avoid the growth of a class conscious society in this country . There are those who fail to read both the signs of the times and American history . They would try to refuse the worker any effective power to bargain collectively , to earn a decent livelihood and to acquire security . It is those short sighted ones , not labor , who threaten this country with that class dissension which in other countries has led to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and hatred as the dominant emotions in human life . All American workers , brain workers and manual workers alike , and all the rest of us whose well being depends on theirs , know that our needs are one in building an orderly economic democracy in which all can profit and in which all can be secure from the kind of faulty economic direction which brought us to the brink of common ruin seven years ago . There is no cleavage between white collar workers and manual workers , between artists and artisans , musicians and mechanics , lawyers and accountants and architects and miners . Tomorrow , Labor Day , belongs to all of us . Tomorrow , Labor Day , symbolizes the hope of all Americans . Anyone who calls it a class holiday challenges the whole concept of American democracy . The Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom a freedom which without economic freedom is meaningless indeed . Labor Day symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality .<speech_sep>My Fellow Americans Over a year and a half ago I said this to the Congress The militarists in Berlin , and Rome and Tokyo started this war , but the massed angered forces of common humanity will finish it . Today that prophecy is in the process of being fulfilled . The massed , angered forces of common humanity are on the march . They are going forward on the Russian front , in the vast Pacific area , and into Europe converging upon their ultimate objectives Berlin and Tokyo . I think the first crack in the Axis has come . The criminal , corrupt Fascist regime in Italy is going to pieces . The pirate philosophy of the Fascists and the Nazis cannot stand adversity . The military superiority of the United Nations on sea and land , and in the air has been applied in the right place and at the right time . Hitler refused to send sufficient help to save Mussolini . In fact , Hitler s troops in Sicily stole the Italians motor equipment , leaving Italian soldiers so stranded that they had no choice but to surrender . Once again the Germans betrayed their Italian allies , as they had done time and time again on the Russian front and in the long retreat from Egypt , through Libya and Tripoli , to the final surrender in Tunisia . And so Mussolini came to the reluctant conclusion that the jig was up he could see the shadow of the long arm of justice . But he and his Fascist gang will be brought to book , and punished for their crimes against humanity . No criminal will be allowed to escape by the expedient of resignation . So our terms to Italy are still the same as our terms to Germany and Japan unconditional surrender . We will have no truck with Fascism in any way , in any shape or manner . We will permit no vestige of Fascism to remain . Eventually Italy will reconstitute herself . It will be the people of Italy who will do that , choosing their own government in accordance with the basic democratic principles of liberty and equality . In the meantime , the United Nations will not follow the pattern set by Mussolini and Hitler and the Japanese for the treatment of occupied countries the pattern of pillage and starvation . We are already helping the Italian people in Sicily . With their cordial cooperation , we are establishing and maintaining security and order we are dissolving the organizations which have kept them under Fascist tyranny we are providing them with the necessities of life until the time comes when they can fully provide for themselves . Indeed , the people in Sicily today are rejoicing in the fact that for the first time in years they are permitted to enjoy the fruits of their own labor s they can eat what they themselves grow , instead of having it stolen from them by the Fascists and the Nazis . In every country conquered by the Nazis and the Fascists , or the Japanese militarists , the people have been reduced to the status of slaves or chattels . It is our determination to restore these conquered peoples to the dignity of human beings , masters of their own fate , entitled to freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom from want , and freedom from fear . We have started to make good on that promise . I am sorry if I step on the toes of those Americans who , playing party politics at home , call that kind of foreign policy crazy altruism and starry eyed dreaming . Meanwhile , the war in Sicily and Italy goes on . It must go on , and will go on , until the Italian people realize the futility of continuing to fight in a lost cause a cause to which the people of Italy never gave their wholehearted approval and support . It is a little over a year since we planned the North African campaign . It is six months since we planned the Sicilian campaign . I confess that I am of an impatient disposition , but I think that I understand and that most people understand the amount of time necessary to prepare for any major military or naval operation . We cannot just pick up the telephone and order a new campaign to start the next week . For example , behind the invasion forces in of North Africa , the invasion forces that went out of North Africa , were thousands of ships and planes guarding the long , perilous sea lanes , carrying the men , carrying the equipment and the supplies to the point of attack . And behind all these were the railroad lines and the highways here back home that carried the men and the munitions to the ports of embarkation there were the factories and the mines and the farms here back home that turned out the materials there were the training camps here back home where the men learned how to perform the strange and difficult and dangerous tasks which were to meet them on the beaches and in the deserts and in the mountains . All this had to be repeated , first in North Africa and then in in the attack on Sicily . Here the factor in Sicily the factor of air attack was added for we could use North Africa as the base for softening up the landing places and lines of defense in Sicily , and the lines of supply in Italy . It is interesting for us to realize that every flying fortress that bombed harbor installations at , for example , Naples , bombed it from its base in North Africa , required 1 , 110 gallons of gasoline for each single mission , and that this is the equal of about 375 ration tickets enough gas to drive your car five times across this continent . You will better understand your part in the war and what gasoline rationing means if you multiply this by the gasoline needs of thousands of planes and hundreds of thousands of jeeps , and trucks and tanks that are now serving overseas . I think that the personal convenience of the individual , or the individual family back home here in the United States will appear somewhat less important when I tell you that the initial assault force on Sicily involved 3 , 000 ships which carried 160 , 000 men Americans , British , Canadians and French together with 14 , 000 vehicles , 600 tanks , and 1 , 800 guns . And this initial force was followed every day and every night by thousands of reinforcements . The meticulous care with which the operation in Sicily was planned has paid dividends . For Our casualties in men , in ships and material have been low in fact , far below our estimate . And all of us are proud of the superb skill and courage of the officers and men who have conducted and are conducting those this operations . The toughest resistance developed on the front of the British Eighth Army , which included the Canadians . But that is no new experience for that magnificent fighting force which has made the Germans pay a heavy price for each hour of delay in the final victory . The American Seventh Army , after a stormy landing on the exposed beaches of Southern Sicily , swept with record speed across the island into the capital at Palermo . For many of our troops this was their first battle experience , but they have carried themselves like veterans . And we must give credit for the coordination of the diverse forces in the field , and for the planning of the whole campaign , to the wise and skillful leadership of General Eisenhower . Admiral Cunningham , General Alexander and Sir Marshal Tedder have been towers of strength in handling the complex details of naval and ground and air activities . You have heard some people say that the British and the Americans can never get along well together you have heard some people say that the Army and the Navy and the Air Forces can never get along well together that real cooperation between them is impossible . Tunisia and Sicily have given the lie , once and for all , to these narrow minded prejudices . The dauntless fighting spirit of the British people in this war has been expressed in the historic words and deeds of Winston Churchill and the world knows how the American people feel about him . Ahead of us are much bigger fights . We and our Allies will go into them as we went into Sicily together . And we shall carry on together . Today our production of ships is almost unbelievable . This year we are producing over nineteen million tons of merchant shipping and next year our production will be over twenty one million tons . And in addition to our shipments across the Atlantic , we must realize that in this war we are operating in the Aleutians , in the distant parts of the Southwest Pacific , in India , and off the shores of South America . For several months we have been losing fewer ships by sinkings , and we have been destroying more and more U boats . We hope this will continue . But we cannot be sure . We must not lower our guard for one single instant . An example a tangible result of our great increase in merchant shipping which I think will be good news to civilians at home is that tonight we are able to terminate the rationing of coffee . And we also expect that within a short time we shall get greatly increased allowances of sugar . Those few Americans who grouse and complain about the inconveniences of life here in the United States should learn some lessons from the civilian populations of our Allies Britain , and China , and Russia and of all the lands occupied by our common enemy enemies . The heaviest and most decisive fighting today is going on in Russia . I am glad that the British and we have been able to contribute somewhat to the great striking power of the Russian armies . In 1941 1942 the Russians were able to retire without breaking , to move many of their war plants from western Russia far into the interior , to stand together with complete unanimity in the defense of their homeland . The success of the Russian armies has shown that it is dangerous to make prophecies about them a fact which has been forcibly brought home to that mystic master of strategic intuition , Herr Hitler . The short lived German offensive , launched early this month , was a desperate attempt to bolster the morale of the German people . The Russians were not fooled by this . They went ahead with their own plans for attack plans which coordinate with the whole United Nations offensive strategy . The world has never seen greater devotion , determination and self sacrifice than have been displayed by the Russian people and their armies , under the leadership of Marshal Joseph Stalin . With a nation which in saving itself is thereby helping to save all the world from the Nazi menace , this country of ours should always be glad to be a good neighbor and a sincere friend in the world of the future . In the Pacific , we are pushing the Japs around from the Aleutians to New Guinea . There too we have taken the initiative and we are not going to let go of it . It becomes clearer and clearer that the attrition , the whittling down process against the Japanese is working . The Japs have lost more planes and more ships than they have been able to replace . The continuous and energetic prosecution of the war of attrition will drive the Japs back from their over extended line running from Burma and Siam and the Straits Settlement and Siam through the Netherlands Indies to eastern New Guinea and the Solomons . And we have good reason to believe that their shipping and their air power cannot support such outposts . Our naval and land and air strength in the Pacific is constantly growing . And if the Japanese are basing their future plans for the Pacific on a long period in which they will be permitted to consolidate and exploit their conquered resources , they had better start revising their plans now . I give that to them merely as a helpful suggestion . We are delivering planes and vital war supplies for the heroic armies of Generalissimo Chiang Sai shek , and we must do more at all costs . Our air supply line from India to China across enemy territory continues despite attempted Japanese interference . We have seized the initiative from the Japanese in the air over Burma and now we enjoy superiority . We are bombing Japanese communications , supply dumps , and bases in China , in Indo China , in and Burma . But we are still far from our main objectives in the war against Japan . Let us remember , however , how far we were a year ago from any of our objectives in the European theatre . We are pushing forward to occupation of positions which in time will enable us to attack the Japanese Islands themselves from the North , from the South , from the East , and from the West . You have heard it said that while we are succeeding greatly on the fighting front , we are failing miserably on the home front . I think this is another of those immaturities a false slogan easy to state but untrue in the essential facts . For the longer this war goes on the clearer it becomes that no one can draw a blue pencil down the middle of a page and call one side the fighting front and the other side the home front . For the two of them are inexorably tied together . Every combat division , every naval task force , every squadron of fighting planes is dependent for its equipment and ammunition and fuel and food , as indeed it is for its manpower , dependent on the American people in civilian clothes in the offices and in the factories and on the farms at home . The same kind of careful planning that gained victory in North Africa and Sicily is required , if we are to make victory an enduring reality and do our share in building the kind of peaceful world that which will justify the sacrifices made in this war . The United Nations are substantially agreed on the general objectives for the post war world . They are also agreed that this is not the time to engage in an international discussion of all the terms of peace and all the details of the future . Let us win the war first . We must not relax our pressure on the enemy by taking time out to define every boundary and settle every political controversy in every part of the world . The important thing the all important thing now is to get on with the war and to win it . While concentrating on military victory , we are not neglecting the planning of the things to come , the freedoms which we know will make for more decency and greater justice throughout the world . Among many other things we are , today , laying plans for the return to civilian life of our gallant men and women in the armed services . They must not be demobilized into an environment of inflation and unemployment , to a place on a bread line , or on a corner selling apples . We must , this time , have plans ready instead of waiting to do a hasty , inefficient , and ill considered job at the last moment . I have assured our men in the armed forces that the American people would not let them down when the war is won . I hope that the Congress will help in carrying out this assurance , for obviously the Executive Branch of the Government cannot do it alone . May the Congress do its duty in this regard . The American people will insist on fulfilling this American obligation to the men and women in the armed forces who are winning this war for us . Of course , the returning soldier and sailor and marine are a part of the problem of demobilizing the rest of the millions of Americans who have been working and living in a war economy since 1941 . That larger objective of reconverting wartime America to a peacetime basis is one for which your government is laying plans to be submitted to the Congress for action . But the members of the armed forces have been compelled to make greater economic sacrifice and every other kind of sacrifice than the rest of us , and they are entitled to definite action to help take care of their special problems . The least to which they are entitled , it seems to me , is something like this First 1 . Mustering out pay to every member of the armed forces and merchant marine when he or she is honorably discharged , mustering out pay large enough in each case to cover a reasonable period of time between his discharge and the finding of a new job . Secondly 2 . In case no job is found after diligent search , then unemployment insurance if the individual registers with the United States Employment Service . Third 3 . An opportunity for members of the armed services to get further education or trade training at the cost of the government . Fourth 4 . Allowance of credit to all members of the armed forces , under unemployment compensation and Federal old age and survivors insurance , for their period of service . For these purposes they ought to should be treated as if they had continued their employment in private industry . Fifth 5 . Improved and liberalized provisions for hospitalization , for rehabilitation , for and medical care of disabled members of the armed forces and the merchant marine . And finally 6 . , sufficient pensions for disabled members of the armed forces . Your Government is drawing up other serious , constructive plans for certain immediate forward moves . They concern food , manpower , and other domestic problems that but they tie in with our armed forces . Within a few weeks I shall speak with you again in regard to definite actions to be taken by the Executive Branch of the Government , together with and specific recommendations for new legislation by the Congress . All our calculations for the future , however , must be based on clear understanding of the problems involved . And that can be gained only by straight thinking not guess work , not or political manipulation . I confess that I myself am sometimes bewildered by conflicting statements that I see in the press . One day I read an authoritative statement that we will shall win the war this year , 1943 and the next day comes another statement equally authoritative , that the war will still be going on in 1949 . Of course , both extremes of optimism and pessimism are wrong . The length of the war will depend upon the uninterrupted continuance of all out effort on the fighting fronts and here at home , and that The effort is all one . The American soldier does not like the necessity of waging war . And yet if he lays off for a one single instant he may lose his own life and sacrifice the lives of his comrades . By the same token a worker here at home may not like the driving , wartime conditions under which he has to work and or live . And yet if he gets complacent or indifferent and slacks on his job , he too may sacrifice the lives of American soldiers and contribute to the loss of an important battle . The next time anyone says to you that this war is in the bag , or says and it is all over but the shouting , you should ask him these questions Are you working full time on your job Are you growing all the food you can Are you buying your limit of war bonds Are you loyally and cheerfully cooperating with your Government in preventing inflation and profiteering , and in making rationing work with fairness to all Because if your answer is No then the war is going to last a lot longer than you think . The plans we made for the knocking out of Mussolini and his gang have largely succeeded . But we still have to knock out Hitler and his gang , and Tojo and his gang . No one of us pretends that this will be an easy matter . We still have to defeat Hitler and Tojo on their own home grounds . But this will require a far greater concentration of our national energy and our ingenuity and our skill . It is not too much to say that we must pour into this war the entire strength and intelligence and will power of the United States . We are a great nation a rich nation but we are not so great or so rich that we can afford to waste our substance or the lives or our men by relaxing along the way . We shall not settle for less than total victory . That is the determination of every American on the fighting fronts . That must be , and will be , the determination of every American here at home .<speech_sep>Today I sent my annual message to the Congress , as required by the Constitution . It has been my custom to deliver these annual messages in person , and they have been broadcast to the nation . I intended to follow this same custom this year . But , like a great many other people , I have had the flu and , although I am practically recovered , my Doctor simply would not permit me to leave the White House to go up to the Capitol . Only a few of the newspapers of the United States can print the message in full , and I am anxious that the American people be given an opportunity to hear what I have recommended to the Congress for this very fateful year in our history and the reasons for those recommendations . Here is what I said This nation in the past two years has become an active partner in the world s greatest war against human slavery . We have joined with like minded people in order to defend ourselves in a world that has been gravely threatened with gangster rule . But I do not think that any of us Americans can be content with mere survival . Sacrifices that we and our Allies are making impose upon us all a sacred obligation to see to it that out of this war we and our children will gain something better than mere survival . We are united in determination that this war shall not be followed by another interim which leads to new disaster that we shall not repeat the tragic errors of ostrich isolationism . When Hull went to Moscow in October , when I went to Cairo and Teheran in November , we knew that we were in agreement with our Allies in our common determination to fight and win this war . There were many vital questions concerning the future peace , and they were discussed in an atmosphere of complete candor and harmony . In the last war such discussions , such meetings , did not even begin until the shooting had stopped and the delegates began to assemble at the peace table . There had been no previous opportunities for man to man discussions which lead to meetings of minds . And the result was a peace which was not a peace . And right here I want to address a word or two to some suspicious souls who are fearful that Hull or I have made commitments for the future which might pledge this nation to secret treaties , or to enacting the role of a world Santa Claus . Of course , we made some commitments . We most certainly committed ourselves to very large and very specific military plans which require the use of all allied forces to bring about the defeat of our enemies at the earliest possible time . But there were no secret treaties or political or financial commitments . The one supreme objective for the future , which we discussed for each nation individually , and for all the United Nations , can be summed up in one word Security . And that means not only physical security which provides safety from attacks by aggressors . It means also economic security , social security , moral security in a family of nations . In the plain down to earth talks that I had with the Generalissimo and Marshal Stalin and Prime Minister Churchill , it was abundantly clear that they are all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress by their own peoples progress toward a better life . All our Allies have learned by experience bitter experience that real development will not be possible if they are to be diverted from their purpose by repeated wars or even threats of war . The best interests of each nation , large and small , demand that all freedom loving nations shall join together in a just and durable system of peace . In the present world situation , evidenced by the actions of Germany , and Italy and Japan , unquestioned military control over the disturbers of the peace is as necessary among nations as it is among citizens in any community . And an equally basic essential to peace permanent peace is a decent standard of living for all individual men and women and children in all nations . Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want . There are people who burrow burrow through the nation like unseeing moles , and attempt to spread the suspicion that if other nations are encouraged to raise their standards of living , our own American standard of living must of necessity be depressed . The fact is the very contrary . It has been shown time and again that if the standard of living of any country goes up , so does its purchasing power and that such a rise encourages a better standard of living in neighboring countries with whom it trades . That is just plain common sense and is the kind of plain common sense that provided the basis for our discussions at Moscow , and Cairo and Teheran . Returning from my journeying , I must confess to a sense of being let down when I found many evidences of faulty perspectives here in Washington . The faulty perspective consists in over emphasizing lesser problems and thereby under emphasizing the first and greatest problem . The overwhelming majority of our people have met the demands of this war with magnificent courage and a great deal of understanding . They have accepted inconveniences they have accepted hardships they have accepted tragic sacrifices . However , while the majority goes on about its great work without complaint , we all know that a noisy minority maintains an uproar , an uproar of demands for special favors for special groups . There are pests who swarm through the lobbies of the Congress and the cocktail bars of Washington , representing these special groups as opposed to the basic interests of the nation as a whole . They have come to look upon the war primarily as a chance to make profits for themselves at the expense of their neighbors profits in money or profits in terms of political or social preferment . Such selfish agitation can be and is highly dangerous in wartime . It creates confusion . It damages morale . It hampers our national effort . It prolongs the war . In this war , we have been compelled to learn how interdependent upon each other are all groups and sections of the whole population of America . Increased food costs , for example , will bring new demands for wage increases from all war workers , which will in turn raise all prices of all things including those things which the farmers themselves have to buy . Increased wages or prices will each in turn produce the same results . They all have a particularly disastrous result on all fixed income groups . And I hope you will remember that all of us in this government , including myself , represent the fixed income group just as much as we represent business owners , or workers or farmers . This group of fixed income people include teachers , and clergy , and policemen , and firemen , and widows and minors who are on fixed incomes , wives and dependents of our soldiers and sailors , and old age pensioners . They and their families add up to more than a quarter of our 130 million people . They have few or no high pressure representatives at the Capitol . And in a period of gross inflation they would be the worst sufferers . Let us give them an occasional thought . If ever there was a time to subordinate individual or group selfishness for the national good , that time is now . Disunity at home , and bickering , self seeking partisanship , stoppages of work , inflation , business as usual , politics as usual , luxury as usual and sometimes a failure to tell the whole truth these are the influences which can undermine the morale of the brave men ready to die at the front for us here . Those who are doing most of the complaining , I do not think that they are deliberately striving to sabotage the national war effort . They are laboring under the delusion that the time is past when we must make prodigious sacrifices that the war is already won and we can begin to slacken off . But the dangerous folly of that point of view can be measured by the distance that separates our troops from their ultimate objectives in Berlin and Tokyo and by the sum of all the perils that lie along the way . Over confidence and complacency are among our deadliest of all enemies . And that attitude on the part of anyone government or management or labor can lengthen this war . It can kill American boys . Let us remember the lessons of 1918 . In the summer of that year the tide turned in favor of the Allies . But this government did not relax , nor did the American people . In fact , our nation s effort was stepped up . In August , 1918 , the draft age limits were broadened from 21 to 31 all the way to 18 to 45 . The President called for force to the utmost , and his call was heeded . And in November , only three months later , Germany surrendered . That is the way to fight and win a war all out and not with half an eye on the battlefronts abroad and the other eye and a half on personal selfish , or political interests here at home . Therefore , in order to concentrate all of our energies , all of our resources on winning this war , and to maintain a fair and stable economy at home , I recommend that the Congress adopt First , a realistic and simplified tax law which will tax all unreasonable profits , both individual and corporate , and reduce the ultimate cost of the war to our sons and our daughters . The tax bill now under consideration by the Congress does not begin to meet this test . Secondly , a continuation of the law for the renegotiations of war contracts which will prevent exorbitant profits and assure fair prices to the government . For two long years I have pleaded with the Congress to take undue profits out of war . Third , a cost of food law which will enable the government to place a reasonable floor under the prices the farmer may expect for his production and to place a ceiling on the prices the consumer will have to pay for the necessary food he buys . This should apply , as I have intimated , to necessities only and this will require public funds to carry it out . It will cost in appropriations about one percent of the present annual cost of the war . Fourth , an early re enactment of the stabilization statute of October 1942 . This expires this year , June 30 , 1944 , and if it is not extended well in advance , the country might just as well expect price chaos by summertime . We cannot have stabilization by wishful thinking . We must take positive action to maintain the integrity of the American dollar . And fifth , a national service law which , for the duration of the war , will prevent strikes , and , with certain appropriate exceptions , will make available for war production or for any other essential services every able bodied adult in this whole nation . These five measures together form a just and equitable whole . I would not recommend a national service law unless the other laws were passed to keep down the cost of living , to share equitably the burdens of taxation , to hold the stabilization line , and to prevent undue profits . The federal government already has the basic power to draft capital and property of all kinds for war purposes on a basis of just compensation . And , as you know , I have for three years hesitated to recommend a national service act . Today , however , with all the experience we have behind us and with us , I am convinced of its necessity . Although I believe that we and our Allies can win the war without such a measure , I am certain that nothing less than total mobilization of all our resources of manpower and capital will guarantee an earlier victory , and reduce the toll of suffering and sorrow and blood . As some of my advisers wrote me the other day When the very life of the nation is in peril the responsibility for service is common to all men and women . In such a time there can be no discrimination between the men and women who are assigned by the government to its defense at the battlefront and the men and women assigned to producing the vital materials that are essential to successful military operations . A prompt enactment of a National Service Law would be merely an expression of the universality of this American responsibility . I believe the country will agree that those statements are the solemn truth . National service is the most democratic way to wage a war . Like selective service for the armed forces , it rests on the obligation of each citizen to serve his nation to his utmost where he is best qualified . It does not mean reduction in wages . It does not mean loss of retirement and seniority rights and benefits . It does not mean that any substantial numbers of war workers will be disturbed in their present jobs . Let this fact be wholly clear . There are millions of American men and women who are not in this war at all . That is not because they do not want to be in it . But they want to know where they can best do their share . National service provides that direction . I know that all civilian war workers will be glad to be able to say many years hence to their grandchildren Yes , too , was in service in the great war . I was on duty in an airplane factory , and I helped to make hundreds of fighting planes . The government told me that in doing that I was performing my most useful work in the service of my country . It is argued that we have passed the stage in the war where national service is necessary . But our soldiers and sailors know that this is not true . We are going forward on a long , rough road and , in all journeys , the last miles are the hardest . And it is for that final effort for the total defeat of our enemies that we must mobilize our total resources . The national war program calls for the employment of more people in 1944 than in 1943 . And it is my conviction that the American people will welcome this win the war measure which is based on the eternally just principle of fair for one , fair for all . It will give our people at home the assurance that they are standing four square behind our soldiers and sailors . And it will give our enemies demoralizing assurance that we mean business that we , 130 million Americans , are on the march to Rome , and Berlin and Tokyo . I hope that the Congress will recognize that , although this is a political year , national service is an issue which transcends politics . Great power must be used for great purposes . As to the machinery for this measure , the Congress itself should determine its nature as long as it is wholly non partisan in its makeup . Several alleged reasons have prevented the enactment of legislation which would preserve for our soldiers and sailors and marines the fundamental prerogative of citizenship in other words , the right to vote . No amount of legalistic argument can becloud this issue in the eyes of these ten million American citizens . Surely the signers of the Constitution did not intend a document which , even in wartime , would be construed to take away the franchise of any of those who are fighting to preserve the Constitution itself . Our soldiers and sailors and marines know that the overwhelming majority of them will be deprived of the opportunity to vote , if the voting machinery is left exclusively to the states under existing state laws and that there is no likelihood of these laws being changed in time to enable them to vote at the next election . The Army and Navy have reported that it will be impossible effectively to administer 48 different soldier voting laws . It is the duty of the Congress to remove this unjustifiable discrimination against the men and women in our armed forces and to do it just as quickly as possible . It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy . More than the winning of the war , it is time to begin plans and determine the strategy for winning a lasting peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever known before . This republic had its beginning , and grew to its present strength , under the protection of certain inalienable political rights among them the right of free speech , free press , free worship , trial by jury , freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures . They were our rights to life and liberty . We have come to a clear realization of the fact , however , that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence . Necessitous men are not free men . People who are hungry , people who are out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made . In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self evident . We have accepted , so to speak , a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all regardless of station , or race or creed . Among these are The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries , or shops or farms or mines of the nation The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation The right of farmers to raise and sell their products at a return which will give them and their families a decent living The right of every business man , large and small , to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad The right of every family to a decent home The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age , and sickness , and accident and unemployment And finally , the right to a good education . All of these rights spell security . And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward , in the implementation of these rights , to new goals of human happiness and well being . America s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens . For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world . One of the great American industrialists of our day a man who has rendered yeoman service to his country in this crisis recently emphasized the grave dangers of rightist reaction in this nation . Any clear thinking business men share that concern . Indeed , if such reaction should develop if history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so called normalcy of the 1920s then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad , we shall have yielded to the spirit of fascism here at home . I ask the Congress to explore the means for implementing this economic bill of rights for it is definitely the responsibility of the Congress so to do , and the country knows it . Many of these problems are already before committees of the Congress in the form of proposed legislation . I shall from time to time communicate with the Congress with respect to these and further proposals . In the event that no adequate program of progress is evolved , I am certain that the nation will be conscious of the fact . Our fighting men abroad and their families at home expect such a program and have the right to insist on it . It is to their demands that this government should pay heed , rather than to the whining demands of selfish pressure groups who seek to feather their nests while young Americans are dying . I have often said that there are no two fronts for America in this war . There is only one front . There is one line of unity that extends from the hearts of people at home to the men of our attacking forces in our farthest outposts . When we speak of our total effort , we speak of the factory and the field and the mine as well as the battlefield we speak of the soldier and the civilian , the citizen and his government . Each and every one of them has a solemn obligation under God to serve this nation in its most critical hour to keep this nation great to make this nation greater in a better world .<speech_sep>I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down during the presentation of what I want to say , but I know that you will realize that it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs and also because of the fact that I have just completed a fourteen thousand mile trip . First of all , I want to say , it is good to be home . It has been a long journey . I hope you will also agree that it has been , so far , a fruitful one . Speaking in all frankness , the question of whether it is entirely fruitful or not lies to a great extent in your hands . For unless you here in the halls of the American Congress with the support of the American people concur in the general conclusions reached at Yalta , and give them your active support , the meeting will not have produced lasting results . That is why I have come before you at the earliest hour I could after my return . I want to make a personal report to you and , at the same time , to the people of the country . Many months of earnest work are ahead of us all , and I should like to feel that when the last stone is laid on the structure of international peace , it will be an achievement for which all of us in America have worked steadfastly and unselfishly together . I am returning from this trip that took me so far refreshed and inspired . I was well the entire time . I was not ill for a second , until I arrived back in Washington , and there I heard all of the rumors which had occurred in my absence . I returned from the trip refreshed and inspired . The Roosevelts are not , as you may suspect , averse to travel . We seem to thrive on it Far away as I was , I was kept constantly informed of affairs in the United States . The modern miracles of rapid communication have made this world very small . We must always bear in mind that fact , when we speak or think of international relations . I received a steady stream of messages from Washington I might say from not only the executive branch with all its departments , but also from the legislative branch and except where radio silence was necessary for security purposes , I could continuously send messages any place in the world . And of course , in a grave emergency , we could have even risked the breaking of the security rule . I come from the Crimea Conference with a firm belief that we have made a good start on the road to a world of peace . There were two main purposes in this Crimea Conference . The first was to bring defeat to Germany with the greatest possible speed , and the smallest possible loss of Allied men . That purpose is now being carried out in great force . The German Army , and the German people , are feeling the ever increasing might of our fighting men and of the Allied armies . Every hour gives us added pride in the heroic advance of our troops in Germany on German soil toward a meeting with the gallant Red Army . The second purpose was to continue to build the foundation for an international accord that would bring order and security after the chaos of the war , that would give some assurance of lasting peace among the Nations of the world . Toward that goal also , a tremendous stride was made . At Teheran , a little over a year ago , there were long range military plans laid by the Chiefs of Staff of the three most powerful Nations . Among the civilian leaders at Teheran , however , at that time , there were only exchanges of views and expressions of opinion . No political arrangements were made and none was attempted . At the Crimea Conference , however , the time had come for getting down to specific cases in the political field . There was on all sides at this Conference an enthusiastic effort to reach an agreement . Since the time of Teheran , a year ago , there had developed among all of us a what shall I call it a greater facility in negotiating with each other , that augurs well for the peace of the world . We know each other better . I have never for an instant wavered in my belief that an agreement to insure world peace and security can be reached . There were a number of things that we did that were concrete that were definite . For instance , the lapse of time between Teheran and Yalta without conferences of civilian representatives of the three major powers has proved to be too long fourteen months . During that long period , local problems were permitted to become acute in places like Poland and Greece and Italy and Yugoslavia . Therefore , we decided at Yalta that , even if circumstances made it impossible for the heads of the three Governments to meet more often in the future , we would make sure that there would be more frequent personal contacts for the exchange of views , between the Secretaries of State and the Foreign Ministers of these three powers . We arranged for periodic meetings at intervals of three or four months . I feel very confident that under this arrangement there will be no recurrences of the incidents which this winter disturbed the friends of world wide cooperation and collaboration . When we met at Yalta , in addition to laying our strategic and tactical plans for the complete and final military victory over Germany , there were other problems of vital political consequence . For instance , first , there were the problems of the occupation and control of Germany after victory the complete destruction of her military power , and the assurance that neither the Nazis nor Prussian militarism could again be revived to threaten the peace and the civilization of the world . Second again for example there was the settlement of the few differences that remained among us with respect to the International Security Organization after the Dumbarton Oaks Conference . As you remember , at that time , I said that we had agreed ninety percent . Well , that is a pretty good percentage . I think the other ten percent was ironed out at Yalta . Third , there were the general political and economic problems common to all of the areas which had been or would be liberated from the Nazi yoke . This is a very special problem . We over here find it difficult to understand the ramifications of many of these problems in foreign lands , but we are trying to . Fourth , there were the special problems created by a few instances such as Poland and Yugoslavia . Days were spent in discussing these momentous matters and we argued freely and frankly across the table . But at the end , on every point , unanimous agreement was reached . And more important even than the agreement of words , I may say we achieved a unity of thought and a way of getting along together . Of course , we know that it was Hitler s hope and the German war lords that we would not agree that some slight crack might appear in the solid wall of Allied unity , a crack that would give him and his fellow gangsters one last hope of escaping their just doom . That is the objective for which his propaganda ma chine has been working for many months . But Hitler has failed . Never before have the major Allies been more closely united not only in their war aims but also in their peace aims . And they are determined to continue to be united with each other and with all peace loving Nations so that the ideal of lasting peace will become a reality . The Soviet , British , and United States Chiefs of Staff held daily meetings with each other . They conferred frequently with Marshal Stalin , and with Prime Minister Churchill and with me , on the problem of coordinating the strategic and tactical efforts of the Allied powers . They completed their plans for the final knock out blows to Germany . At the time of the Teheran Conference , the Russian front was removed so far from the American and British fronts that , while certain long range strategic cooperation was possible , there could be no tactical , day by day coordination . They were too far apart . But Russian troops have now crossed Poland . They are fighting on the Eastern soil of Germany herself British and American troops are now on German soil close to the Rhine River in the West . It is a different situation today from what it was fourteen months ago a closer tactical liaison has become possible for the first time in Europe and , in the Crimea Conference , that was something else that was accomplished . Provision was made for daily exchange of information between the armies under the command of General Eisenhower on the western front , and those armies under the command of the Soviet marshals on that long eastern front , and also with our armies in Italy without the necessity of going through the Chiefs of Staff in Washington or London as in the past . You have seen one result of this exchange of information in the recent bombings by American and English aircraft of points which are directly related to the Russian advance on Berlin . From now on , American and British heavy bombers will be used in the day by day tactics of the war and we have begun to realize , I think , that there is all the difference in the world between tactics on the one side , and strategy on the other day by day tactics of the war in direct support of the Soviet armies , as well as in the support of our own on the western front . They are now engaged in bombing and strafing in order to hamper the movement of German reserves and materials to the eastern and western fronts from other parts of Germany or from Italy . Arrangements have been made for the most effective distribution of all available material and transportation to the places where they can best be used in the combined war effort American , British , and Russian . Details of these plans and arrangements are military secrets , of course but this tying of things in together is going to hasten the day of the final collapse of Germany . The Nazis are learning about some of them already , to their sorrow . And I think all three of us at the Conference felt that they will learn more about them tomorrow and the next day and the day after that There will be no respite for them . We will not desist for one moment until unconditional surrender . You know , I have always felt that common sense prevails in the long run quiet , overnight thinking . I think that is true in Germany , just as much as it is here . The German people , as well as the German soldiers must realize that the sooner they give up and surrender by groups or as individuals , the sooner their present agony will be over . They must realize that only with complete surrender can they begin to reestablish themselves as people whom the world might accept as decent neighbors . We made it clear again at Yalta , and I now repeat that unconditional surrender does not mean the destruction or enslavement of the German people . The Nazi leaders have deliberately withheld that part of the Yalta declaration from the German press and radio . They seek to convince the people of Germany that the Yalta declaration does mean slavery and destruction for them they are working at it day and night for that is how the Nazis hope to save their own skins , and deceive their people into continued and useless resistance . We did , however , make it clear at the Conference just what unconditional surrender does mean for Germany . It means the temporary control of Germany by Great Britain , Russia , France , and the United States . Each of these Nations will occupy and control a separate zone of Germany and the administration of the four zones will be coordinated in Berlin by a Control Council composed of representatives of the four Nations . Unconditional surrender means something else . It means the end of Nazism . It means the end of the Nazi Party and of all its barbaric laws and institutions . It means the termination of all militaristic influence in the public , private , and cultural life of Germany . It means for the Nazi war criminals a punishment that is speedy and just and severe . It means the complete disarmament of Germany the destruction of its militarism and its military equipment the end of its production of armament the dispersal of all its armed forces the permanent dismemberment of the German General Staff which has so often shattered the peace of the world . It means that Germany will have to make reparations in kind for the damage which has been done to the innocent victims of its aggression . By compelling reparations in kind in plants , in machinery , in rolling stock , and in raw materials we shall avoid the mistake that we and other Nations made after the last war , the demanding of reparations in the form of money which Germany could never pay . We do not want the German people to starve , or to become a burden on the rest of the world . Our objective in handling Germany is simple it is to secure the peace of the rest of the world now and in the future . Too much experience has shown that that objective is impossible if Germany is allowed to retain any ability to wage aggressive warfare . These objectives will not hurt the German people . On the contrary , they will protect them from a repetition of the fate which the General Staff and Kaiserism imposed on them before , and which Hitlerism is now imposing upon them again a hundredfold . It will be removing a cancer from the German body politic which for generations has produced only misery and only pain to the whole world . During my stay in Yalta , I saw the kind of reckless , senseless fury , the terrible destruction that comes out of German militarism . Yalta , on the Black Sea , had no military significance of any kind . It had no defenses . Before the last war , it had been a resort for people like the Czars and princes and for the aristocracy of Russia and the hangers on . However , after the Red Revolution , and until the attack on the Soviet Union by Hitler , the palaces and the villas of Yalta had been used as a rest and recreation center by the Russian people . The Nazi officers took these former palaces and villas took them over for their own use . The only reason that the so called former palace of the Czar was still habitable , when we got there , was that it had been given or he thought it had been given to a German general for his own property and his own use . And when Yalta was so destroyed , he kept soldiers there to protect what he thought would become his own , nice villa . It was a useful rest and recreation center for hundreds of thousands of Russian workers , farmers , and their families , up to the time that it was taken again by the Germans . The Nazi officers took these places for their own use , and when the Red Army forced the Nazis out of the Crimea almost just a year ago all of these villas were looted by the Nazis , and then nearly all of them were destroyed by bombs placed on the inside . And even the humblest of the homes of Yalta were not spared . There was little left of it except blank walls , ruins , destruction and desolation . Sevastopol that was a fortified port , about forty or fifty miles away there again was a scene of utter destruction a large city with great navy yards and fortifications I think less than a dozen buildings were left intact in the entire city . I had read about Warsaw and Lidice and Rotterdam and Coventry but I saw Sevastopol and Yalta And I know that there is not room enough on earth for both German militarism and Christian decency . Of equal importance with the military arrangements at the Crimea Conference were the agreements reached with respect to a general international organization for lasting world peace . The foundations were laid at Dumbarton Oaks . There was one point , however , on which agreement was not reached at Dumbarton Oaks . It involved the procedure of voting in the Security Council . I want to try to make it clear by making it simple . It took me hours and hours to get the thing straight in my own mind and many conferences . At the Crimea Conference , the Americans made a proposal on this subject which , after full discussion was , I am glad to say , unanimously adopted by the other two Nations . It is not yet possible to announce the terms of that agreement publicly , but it will be in a very short time . When the conclusions reached with respect to voting in the Security Council are made known , I think and I hope that you will find them a fair solution of this complicated and difficult problem . They are founded in justice , and will go far to assure international cooperation in the maintenance of peace . A conference of all the United Nations of the world will meet in San Francisco on April 25 , 1945 . There , we all hope , and confidently expect , to execute a definite charter of organization under which the peace of the world will be preserved and the forces of aggression permanently outlawed . This time we are not making the mistake of waiting until the end of the war to set up the machinery of peace . This time , as we fight together to win the war finally , we work together to keep it from happening again . I as you know have always been a believer in the document called the Constitution of the United States . And I spent a good deal of time in educating two other Nations of the world in regard to the Constitution of the United States . The charter has to be and should be approved by the Senate of the United States , under the Constitution . I think the other Nations all know it now . I am aware of that fact , and now all the other Nations are . And we hope that the Senate will approve of what is set forth as the Charter of the United Nations when they all come together in San Francisco next month . The Senate of the United States , through its appropriate representatives , has been kept continuously advised of the program of this Government in the creation of the International Security Organization . The Senate and the House of Representatives will both be represented at the San Francisco Conference . The Congressional delegates to the San Francisco Conference will consist of an equal number of Republican and Democratic members . The American Delegation is in every sense of the word bipartisan . World peace is not a party question . I think that Republicans want peace just as much as Democrats . It is not a party question any more than is military victory the winning of the war . When the Republic was threatened , first by the Nazi clutch for world conquest back in 1940 and then by the Japanese treachery in 1941 , partisanship and politics were laid aside by nearly every American and every resource was dedicated to our common safety . The same consecration to the cause of peace will be expected , I think , by every patriotic American , and by every human soul overseas . The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man , or one party , or one Nation . It cannot be just an American peace , or a British peace , or a Russian , a French , or a Chinese peace . It cannot be a peace of large Nations or of small Nations . It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world . It cannot be a structure of complete perfection at first . But it can be a peace and it will be a peace based on the sound and just principles of the Atlantic Charter on the concept of the dignity of the human being and on the guarantees of tolerance and freedom of religious worship . As the Allied armies have marched to military victory , they have liberated people whose liberties had been crushed by the Nazis for four long years , whose economy has been reduced to ruin by Nazi despoilers . There have been instances of political confusion and unrest in these liberated areas that is not unexpected as in Greece or in Poland or in Yugoslavia , and there may be more . Worse than that , there actually began to grow up in some of these places queer ideas of , for instance , spheres of influence that were incompatible with the basic principles of international collaboration . If allowed to go on unchecked , these developments might have had tragic results in time . It is fruitless to try to place the blame for this situation on one particular Nation or on another . It is the kind of development that is almost inevitable unless the major powers of the world continue without interruption to work together and to assume joint responsibility for the solution of problems that may arise to endanger the peace of the world . We met in the Crimea , determined to settle this matter of liberated areas . Things that might happen that we cannot foresee at this moment might happen suddenly , unexpectedly , next week or next month . And I am happy to confirm to the Congress that we did arrive at a settlement and , incidentally , a unanimous settlement . The three most powerful Nations have agreed that the political and economic problems of any area liberated from Nazi conquest , or of any former Axis satellite , are a joint responsibility of all three Governments . They will join together , during the temporary period of instability after hostilities to help the people of any liberated area , or of any former satellite state , to solve their own problems through firmly established democratic processes . They will endeavor to see to it that the people who carry on the interim government between occupation of Germany and true independence , will be as representative as possible of all democratic elements in the population , and that free elections are held as soon as possible thereafter . Responsibility for political conditions thousands of miles away can no longer be avoided by this great Nation . Certainly , I do not want to live to see another war . As I have said , the world is smaller smaller every year . The United States now exerts a tremendous influence in the cause of peace throughout all the world . What we people over here are thinking and talking about is in the interest of peace , because it is known all over the world . The slightest remark in either House of the Congress is known all over the world the following day . We will continue to exert that influence , only if we are willing to continue to share in the responsibility for keeping the peace . It will be our own tragic loss , I think , if we were to shirk that responsibility . The final decisions in these areas are going to be made jointly and therefore they will often be a result of give and take compromise . The United States will not always have its way a hundred percent nor will Russia nor Great Britain . We shall not always have ideal answers solutions to complicated international problems , even though we are determined continuously to strive toward that ideal . But I am sure that under the agreements reached at Yalta , there will be a more stable political Europe than ever before . Of course , once there has been a free expression of the people s will in any country , our immediate responsibility ends with the exception only of such action as may be agreed on in the International Security Organization that we hope to set up . The United Nations must also soon begin to help these liberated areas adequately to reconstruct their economy so that they are ready to resume their places in the world . The Nazi war machine has stripped them of raw materials and machine tools and trucks and locomotives . They have left the industry of these places stagnant and much of the agricultural areas are unproductive . The Nazis have left a ruin in their wake . To start the wheels running again is not a mere matter of relief . It is to the national interest that all of us see to it that these liberated areas are again made self supporting and productive so that they do not need continuous relief from us . I should say that was an argument based on plain common sense . One outstanding example of joint action by the three major Allied powers in the liberated areas was the solution reached on Poland . The whole Polish question was a potential source of trouble in postwar Europe is it has been sometimes before and we came to the Conference determined to find a common ground for its solution . And we did even though everybody does not agree with us , obviously . Our objective was to help to create a strong , independent , and prosperous Nation . That is the thing we must always remember , those words , agreed to by Russia , by Britain , and by the United States the objective of making Poland a strong , independent , and prosperous Nation , with a government ultimately to be selected by the Polish people themselves . To achieve that objective , it was necessary to provide for the formation of a new government much more representative than had been possible while Poland was enslaved . There were , as you know , two governments one in London , one in Lublin practically in Russia . Accordingly , steps were taken at Yalta to reorganize the existing Provisional Government in Poland on a broader democratic basis , so as to include democratic leaders now in Poland and those abroad . This new , reorganized government will be recognized by all of us as the temporary government of Poland . Poland needs a temporary government in the worst way an ad interim government , I think is another way of putting it . However , the new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity will be pledged to holding a free election as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and a secret ballot . Throughout history , Poland has been the corridor through which attacks on Russia have been made . Twice in this generation , Germany has struck at Russia through this corridor . To insure European security and world peace , a strong and independent Poland is necessary to prevent that from happening again . The decision with respect to the boundaries of Poland was , frankly , a compromise . I did not agree with all of it , by any means , but we did not go as far as Britain wanted , in certain areas we did not go so far as Russia wanted , in certain areas and we did not go so far as I wanted , in certain areas . It was a compromise . The decision is one , however , under which the Poles will receive compensation in territory in the North and West in exchange for what they lose by the Curzon Line in the East . The limits of the western border will be permanently fixed in the final Peace Conference . We know , roughly , that it will include , in the new , strong Poland , quite a large slice of what now is called Germany . And it was agreed , also , that the new Poland will have a large and long coast line , and many new harbors . Also , that most of East Prussia will go to Poland . A corner of it will go to Russia . Also , that the anomaly of the Free State of Danzig will come to an end I think Danzig would be a lot better if it were Polish . It is well known that the people east of the Curzon Line just for example , here is why I compromised are predominantly white Russian and Ukrainian , they are not Polish and a very great majority of the people west of the line are predominantly Polish , except in that part of East Prussia and eastern Germany , which will go to the new Poland . As far back as 1919 , representatives of the Allies agreed that the Curzon Line represented a fair boundary between the two peoples . And you must remember , also , that there had not been any Polish government before 1919 for a great many generations . I am convinced that the agreement on Poland , under the circumstances , is the most hopeful agreement possible for a free , independent , and prosperous Polish state . The Crimea Conference was a meeting of the three major military powers on whose shoulders rested chief responsibility and burden of the war . Although , for this reason , France was not a participant in the Conference , no one should detract from the recognition that was accorded there of her role in the future of Europe and the future of the world . France has been invited to accept a zone of control in Germany , and to participate as a fourth member of the Allied Control Council of Germany . She has been invited to join as a sponsor of the International Conference at San Francisco next month . She will be a permanent member of the International Security Council together with the other four major powers . And , finally , we have asked that France be associated with us in our joint responsibility over all the liberated areas of Europe . Agreement was reached on Yugoslavia , as announced in the communique and we hope that it is in process of fulfillment . But , not only there but in some other places , we have to remember that there are a great many prima donnas in the world . All of them wish to be heard before anything becomes final , so we may have a little delay while we listen to more prima donnas . Quite naturally , this Conference concerned itself only with the European war and with the political problems of Europe and not with the Pacific war . In Malta , however , our combined British and American staffs made their plans to increase the attack against Japan . The Japanese war lords know that they are not being over looked . They have felt the force of our B 29 s , and our carrier planes they have felt the naval might of the United States , and do not appear very anxious to come out and try it again . The Japs now know what it means to hear that The United States Marines have landed . And I think I can add that , having Iwo Jima in mind , The situation is well in hand . They also know what is in store for the homeland of Japan now that General MacArthur has completed his magnificent march back to Manila and now that Admiral Nimitz is establishing air bases right in the back yard of Japan itself in Iwo Jima . But , lest somebody else start to stop work in the United States , I repeat what I have so often said , in one short sentence , even in my sleep We have not won the wars yet with an s on wars . It is still a long , tough road to Tokyo . It is longer to go to Tokyo than it is to Berlin , in every sense of the word . The defeat of Germany will not mean the end of the war against Japan . On the contrary , we must be prepared for a long and costly struggle in the Pacific . But the unconditional surrender of Japan is as essential as the defeat of Germany . I say that advisedly , with the thought in mind that that is especially true if our plans for world peace are to succeed . For Japanese militarism must be wiped out as thoroughly as German militarism . On the way back from the Crimea , I made arrangements to meet personally King Farouk of Egypt , Halle Selassie , the Emperor of Ethiopia , and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia . Our conversations had to do with matters of common interest . They will be of great mutual advantage because they gave me , and a good many of us , an opportunity of meeting and talking face to face , and of exchanging views in personal conversation instead of formal correspondence . For instance , on the problem of Arabia , I learned more about that whole problem the Moslem problem , the Jewish problem by talking with Ibn Saud for five minutes , than I could have learned in the exchange of two or three dozen letters . On my voyage , I had the benefit of seeing the Army and Navy and the Air Force at work . All Americans , I think , would feel as proud of our armed forces as I am , if they could see and hear what I saw and heard . Against the most efficient professional soldiers and sailors and airmen of all history , our men stood and fought and won . This is our chance to see to it that the sons and the grandsons of these gallant fighting men do not have to do it all over again in a few years . The Conference in the Crimea was a turning point I hope in our history and therefore in the history of the world . There will soon be presented to the Senate of the United States and to the American people a great decision that will determine the fate of the United States and of the world for generations to come . There can be no middle ground here . We shall have to take the responsibility for world collaboration , or we shall have to bear the responsibility for another world conflict . I know that the word planning is not looked upon with favor in some circles . In domestic affairs , tragic mistakes have been made by reason of lack of planning and , on the other hand , many great improvements in living . and many benefits to the human race , have been accomplished as a result of adequate , intelligent planning reclamation of desert areas , developments of whole river valleys , and provision for adequate housing . The same will be true in relations between Nations . For the second time in the lives of most of us this generation is face to face with the objective of preventing wars . To meet that objective , the Nations of the world will either have a plan or they will not . The groundwork of a plan has now been furnished , and has been submitted to humanity for discussion and decision . No plan is perfect . Whatever is adopted at San Francisco will doubtless have to be amended time and again over the years , just as our own Constitution has been . No one can say exactly how long any plan will last . Peace can endure only so long as humanity really insists upon it , and is willing to work for it and sacrifice for it . Twenty five years ago , American fighting men looked to the statesmen of the world to finish the work of peace for which they fought and suffered . We failed them then . We cannot fail them again , and expect the world again to survive . The Crimea Conference was a successful effort by the three leading Nations to find a common ground for peace . It ought to spell the end of the system of unilateral action , the exclusive alliances , the spheres of influence , the balances of power , and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries and have always failed . We propose to substitute for all these , a universal organization in which all peace loving Nations will finally have a chance to join . I am confident that the Congress and the American people will accept the results of this Conference as the beginnings of a permanent structure of peace upon which we can begin to build , under God , that better world in which our children and grandchildren yours and mine , the children and grandchildren of the whole world must live , and can live . And that , my friends , is the principal message I can give you . But I feel it very deeply , as I know that all of you are feeling it today , and are going to feel it in the future .<speech_sep>I am speaking tonight from the White House in the presence of the Governing Board of the Pan American Union , the Canadian Minister , and their families . The members of this Board are the Ambassadors and Ministers of the American Republics in Washington . It is appropriate that I do this for now , as never before , the unity of the American Republics is of supreme importance to each and every one of us and to the cause of freedom throughout the world . Our future independence is bound up with the future independence of all of our sister Republics . The pressing problems that confront us are military and naval problems . We cannot afford to approach them from the point of view of wishful thinkers or sentimentalists . What we face is cold , hard fact . The first and fundamental fact is that what started as a European war has developed , as the Nazis always intended it should develop , into a world war for world domination . Adolf Hitler never considered the domination of Europe as an end in itself . European conquest was but a step toward ultimate goals in all the other continents . It is unmistakably apparent to all of us that , unless the advance of Hitlerism is forcibly checked now , the Western Hemisphere will be within range of the Nazi weapons of destruction . For our own defense we have accordingly undertaken certain obviously necessary measures First , we have joined in concluding a series of agreements with all the other American Republics . This further solidified our hemisphere against the common danger . And then , a year ago , we launched , and are successfully carrying out , the largest armament production program we have ever undertaken . We have added substantially to our splendid Navy , and we have mustered our manpower to build up a new Army which is already worthy of the highest traditions of our military service . We instituted a policy of aid for the democracies the Nations which have fought for the continuation of human liberties . This policy had its origin in the first month of the war , when I urged upon the Congress repeal of the arms embargo provisions in the old Neutrality Law , and in that message of September 3 , 1939 , I said , I should like to be able to offer the hope that the shadow over the world might swiftly pass . I cannot . The facts compel my stating , with candor , that darker periods may lie ahead . In the subsequent months , the shadows deepened and lengthened . And the night spread over Poland , Denmark , Norway , Holland , Belgium , Luxembourg , and France . In June , 1940 , Britain stood alone , faced by the same machine of terror which had overwhelmed her allies . Our Government rushed arms to meet her desperate needs . In September , 1940 , an agreement was completed with Great Britain for the trade of fifty destroyers for eight important offshore bases . And in March , 1941 , the Congress passed the Lend Lease Bill and an appropriation of seven billion dollars to implement it . This law realistically provided for material aid for the government of any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States . Our whole program of aid for the democracies has been based on hard headed concern for our own security and for the kind of safe and civilized world in which we wish to live . Every dollar of material that we send helps to keep the dictators away from our own hemisphere , and every day that they are held off gives us time to build more guns and tanks and planes and ships . We have made no pretense about our own self interest in this aid . Great Britain understands it and so does Nazi Germany . And now after a year Britain still fights gallantly , on a far flung battle line . We have doubled and redoubled our vast production , increasing , month by month , our material supply of the tools of war for ourselves and for Britain and for China and eventually for all the democracies . The supply of these tools will not fail it will increase . With greatly augmented strength , the United States and the other American Republics now chart their course in the situation of today . Your Government knows what terms Hitler , if victorious , would impose . They are , indeed , the only terms on which he would accept a so called negotiated peace . And , under those terms , Germany would literally parcel out the world hoisting the swastika itself over vast territories and populations , and setting up puppet governments of its own choosing , wholly subject to the will and the policy of a conqueror . To the people of the Americas , a triumphant Hitler would say , as he said after the seizure of Austria , and as he said after Munich , and as he said after the seizure of Czechoslovakia I am now completely satisfied . This is the last territorial readjustment I will seek . And he would of course add All we want is peace , friendship , and profitable trade relations with you in the New World . Were any of us in the Americas so incredibly simple and forgetful as to accept those honeyed words , what would then happen Those in the New World who were seeking profits would be urging that all that the dictatorships desired was peace . They would oppose toil and taxes for more American armament . And meanwhile , the dictatorships would be forcing the enslaved peoples of their Old World conquests into a system they are even now organizing to build a naval and air force intended to gain and hold and be master of the Atlantic and the Pacific as well . They would fasten an economic stranglehold upon our several Nations . Quislings would be found to subvert the governments in our Republics and the Nazis would back their fifth columns with invasion , if necessary . No , I am not speculating about all this . I merely repeat what is already in the Nazi book of world conquest . They plan to treat the Latin American Nations as they are now treating the Balkans . They plan then to strangle the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada . The American laborer would have to compete with slave labor in the rest of the world . Minimum wages , maximum hours Nonsense Wages and hours would be fixed by Hitler . The dignity and power and standard of living of the American worker and farmer would be gone . Trade unions would become historical relics , and collective bargaining a joke . Farm income What happens to all farm surpluses without any foreign trade The American farmer would get for his products exactly what Hitler wanted to give . The farmer would face obvious disaster and complete regimentation . Tariff walls Chinese walls of isolation would be futile . Freedom to trade is essential to our economic life . We do not eat all the food we can produce and we do not burn all the oil we can pump we do not use all the goods we can manufacture . It would not be an American wall to keep Nazi goods out it would be a Nazi wall to keep us in . The whole fabric of working life as we know it business and manufacturing , mining and agriculture all would be mangled and crippled under such a system . Yet to maintain even that crippled independence would require permanent conscription of our manpower it would curtail the funds we could spend on education , on housing , on public works , on flood control , on health and , instead , we should be permanently pouring our resources into armaments and , year in and year out , standing day and night watch against the destruction of our cities . Yes , even our right of worship would be threatened . The Nazi world does not recognize any God except Hitler for the Nazis are as ruthless as the Communists in the denial of God . What place has religion which preaches the dignity of the human being , the majesty of the human soul , in a world where moral standards are measured by treachery and bribery and fifth columnists Will our children , too , wander off , goose stepping in search of new gods We do not accept , we will not permit , this Nazi shape of things to come . It will never be forced upon us , if we act in this present crisis with the wisdom and the courage which have distinguished our country in all the crises of the past . Today , the Nazis have taken military possession of the greater part of Europe . In Africa they have occupied Tripoli and Libya , and they are threatening Egypt , the Suez Canal , and the Near East . But their plans do not stop there , for the Indian Ocean is the gateway to the farther East . They also have the armed power at any moment to occupy Spain and Portugal and that threat extends not only to French North Africa and the western end of the Mediterranean but it extends also to the Atlantic fortress of Dakar , and to the island outposts of the New World the Azores and Cape Verde Islands . The Cape Verde Islands are only seven hours distance from Brazil by bomber or troop carrying planes . They dominate shipping routes to and from the South Atlantic . The war is approaching the brink of the Western Hemisphere itself . It is coming very close to home . Control or occupation by Nazi forces of any of the islands of the Atlantic would jeopardize the immediate safety of portions of North and South America , and of the island possessions of the United States , and , therefore , the ultimate safety of the continental United States itself . Hitler s plan of world domination would be near its accomplishment today , were it not for two factors One is the epic resistance of Britain , her colonies , and the great Dominions , fighting not only to maintain the existence of the Island of Britain , but also to hold the Near East and Africa . The other is the magnificent defense of China , which will , I have reason to believe , increase in strength . All of these , together , are preventing the Axis from winning control of the seas by ships and aircraft . The Axis Powers can never achieve their objective of world domination unless they first obtain control of the seas . That is their supreme purpose today and to achieve it , they must capture Great Britain . They could then have the power to dictate to the Western Hemisphere . No spurious argument , no appeal to sentiment , no false pledges like those given by Hitler at Munich , can deceive the American people into believing that he and his Axis partners would not , with Britain defeated , close in relentlessly on this hemisphere of ours . But if the Axis Powers fail to gain control of the seas , then they are certainly defeated . Their dreams of world domination will then go by the board and the criminal leaders who started this war will suffer inevitable disaster . Both they and their people know this and they and their people are afraid . That is why they are risking everything they have , conducting desperate attempts to break through to the command of the ocean . Once they are limited to a continuing land war , their cruel forces of occupation will be unable to keep their heel on the necks of the millions of innocent , oppressed peoples on the continent of Europe and in the end , their whole structure will break into little pieces . And let us remember , the wider the Nazi land effort , the greater is their ultimate danger . We do not forget the silenced peoples . The masters of Germany have marked these silenced peoples and their children s children for slavery those , at least , who have not been assassinated or escaped to free soil . But those people spiritually unconquered Austrians , Czechs , Poles , Norwegians , Dutch , Belgians , Frenchmen , Greeks , Southern Slavs yes , even those Italians and Germans who themselves have been enslaved will prove to be a powerful force in the final disruption of the Nazi system . All freedom meaning freedom to live , and not freedom to conquer and subjugate other peoples depends on freedom of the seas . All of American history North , Central , and South American history has been inevitably tied up with those words , freedom of the seas . Since 1799 , 142 years ago , when our infant Navy made the West Indies and the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico safe for American ships since 1804 and 1805 when we made all peaceful commerce safe from the depredations of the Barbary pirates since the War of 1812 , which was fought for the preservation of sailors rights since 1867 , when our sea power made it possible for the Mexicans to expel the French Army of Louis Napoleon , we have striven and fought in defense of freedom of the seas for our own shipping , for the commerce of our sister Republics , for the right of all Nations to use the highways of world trade and for our own safety . During the first World War we were able to escort merchant ships by the use of small cruisers , gunboats , and destroyers and that type , called a convoy , was effective against submarines . In this second World War , however , the problem is greater . It is different because the attack on the freedom of the seas is now fourfold first the improved submarine second the much greater use of the heavily armed raiding cruiser or the hit and run battleship third the bombing airplane , which is capable of destroying merchant ships seven or eight hundred miles from its nearest base and fourth the destruction of merchant ships in those ports of the world that are accessible to bombing attack . The Battle of the Atlantic now extends from the icy waters of the North Pole to the frozen continent of the Antarctic . Throughout this huge area , there have been sinkings of merchant ships in alarming and increasing numbers by Nazi raiders or submarines . There have been sinkings even of ships carrying neutral flags . There have been sinkings in the South Atlantic , off West Africa and the Cape Verde Islands between the Azores and the islands off the American coast and between Greenland and Iceland . Great numbers of these sinkings have been actually within the waters of the Western Hemisphere itself . The blunt truth is this and I reveal this with the full knowledge of the British Government the present rate of Nazi sinkings of merchant ships is more than three times as high as the capacity of British shipyards to replace them it is more than twice the combined British and American output of merchant ships today . We can answer this peril by two simultaneous measures first , by speeding up and increasing our own great shipbuilding program and second , by helping to cut down the losses on the high seas . Attacks on shipping off the very shores of land which we are determined to protect , present an actual military danger to the Americas . And that danger has recently been heavily underlined by the presence in Western Hemisphere waters of a Nazi battleship of great striking power . You remember that most of the supplies for Britain go by a northerly route , which comes close to Greenland and the nearby island of Iceland . Germany s heaviest attack is on that route . Nazi occupation of Iceland or bases in Greenland would bring the war close to our own continental shores , because those places are stepping stones to Labrador and Newfoundland , to Nova Scotia , yes , to the northern United States itself , including the great industrial centers of the North , the East , and the Middle West . Equally , the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands , if occupied or controlled by Germany , would directly endanger the freedom of the Atlantic and our own American physical safety . Under German domination those islands would become bases for submarines , warships , and airplanes raiding the waters that lie immediately off our own coasts and attacking the shipping in the South Atlantic . They would provide a springboard for actual attack against the integrity and the independence of Brazil and her neighboring Republics . I have said on many occasions that the United States is mustering its men and its resources only for purposes of defense only to repel attack . I repeat that statement now . But we must be realistic when we use the word attack we have to relate it to the lightning speed of modern warfare . Some people seem to think that we are not attacked until bombs actually drop in the streets of New York or San Francisco or New Orleans or Chicago . But they are simply shutting their eyes to the lesson that we must learn from the fate of every Nation that the Nazis have conquered . The attack on Czechoslovakia began with the conquest of Austria . The attack on Norway began with the occupation of Denmark . The attack on Greece began with occupation of Albania and Bulgaria . The attack on the Suez Canal began with the invasion of the Balkans and North Africa , and the attack on the United States can begin with the domination of any base which menaces our security north or south . Nobody can foretell tonight just when the acts of the dictators will ripen into attack on this hemisphere and us . But we know enough by now to realize that it would be suicide to wait until they are in our front yard . When your enemy comes at you in a tank or a bombing plane , if you hold your fire until you see the whites of his eyes , you will never know what hit you . Our Bunker Hill of tomorrow may be several thousand miles from Boston . Anyone with an atlas , anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the sudden striking force of modern war , knows that it is stupid to wait until a probable enemy has gained a foothold from which to attack . Old fashioned common sense calls for the use of a strategy that will prevent such an enemy from gaining a foothold in the first place . We have , accordingly , extended our patrol in North and South Atlantic waters . We are steadily adding more and more ships and planes to that patrol . It is well known that the strength of the Atlantic Fleet has been greatly increased during the past year , and that it is constantly being built up . These ships and planes warn of the presence of attacking raiders , on the sea , under the sea , and above the sea . The danger from these raiders is , of course , greatly lessened if their location is definitely known . We are thus being forewarned . We shall be on our guard against efforts to establish Nazi bases closer to our hemisphere . The deadly facts of war compel Nations , for simple self preservation , to make stern choices . It does not make sense , for instance , to say , I believe in the defense of all the Western Hemisphere , and in the next breath to say , I will not fight for that defense until the enemy has landed on our shores . If we believe in the independence and the integrity of the Americas , we must be willing to fight , to fight to defend them just as much as we would to fight for the safety of our own homes . It is time for us to realize that the safety of American homes even in the center of this our own country has a very definite relationship to the continued safety of homes in Nova Scotia or Trinidad or Brazil . Our national policy today , therefore , is this First , we shall actively resist wherever necessary , and with all our resources , every attempt by Hitler to extend his Nazi domination to the Western Hemisphere , or to threaten it . We shall actively resist his every attempt to gain control of the seas . We insist upon the vital importance of keeping Hitlerism away from any point in the world which could be used or would be used as a base of attack against the Americas . Second , from the point of view of strict naval and military necessity , we shall give every possible assistance to Britain and to all who , with Britain , are resisting Hitlerism or its equivalent with force of arms . Our patrols are helping now to insure delivery of the needed supplies to Britain . All additional measures necessary to deliver the goods will be taken . Any and all further methods or combination of methods , which can or should be utilized , are being devised by our military and naval technicians , who , with me , will work out and put into effect such new and additional safeguards as may be needed . I say that the delivery of needed supplies to Britain is imperative . I say that this can be done it must be done and it will be done . To the other American Nations twenty Republics and the Dominion of Canada I say this the United States does not merely propose these purposes , but is actively engaged today in carrying them out . I say to them further you may disregard those few citizens of the United States who contend that we are disunited and cannot act . There are some timid ones among us who say that we must preserve peace at any price lest we lose our liberties forever . To them I say this never in the history of the world has a Nation lost its democracy by a successful struggle to defend its democracy . We must not be defeated by the fear of the very danger which we are preparing to resist . Our freedom has shown its ability to survive war , but our freedom would never survive surrender . The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . There is , of course , a small group of sincere , patriotic men and women whose real passion for peace has shut their eyes to the ugly realities of international banditry and to the need to resist it at all costs . I am sure they are embarrassed by the sinister support they are receiving from the enemies of democracy in our midst the Bundists , the Fascists , and Communists , and every group devoted to bigotry and racial and religious intolerance . It is no mere coincidence that all the arguments put forward by these enemies of democracy all their attempts to confuse and divide our people and to destroy public confidence in our Government all their defeatist forebodings that Britain and democracy are already beaten all their selfish promises that we can do business with Hitler all of these are but echoes of the words that have been poured out from the Axis bureaus of propaganda . Those same words have been used before in other countries to scare them , to divide them , to soften them up . Invariably , those same words have formed the advance guard of physical attack . Your Government has the right to expect of all citizens that they take part in the common work of our common defense take loyal part from this moment forward . I have recently set up the machinery for civilian defense . It will rapidly organize , locality by locality . It will depend on the organized effort of men and women everywhere . All will have opportunities and responsibilities to fulfill . Defense today means more than merely fighting . It means morale , civilian as well as military it means using every available resource it means enlarging every useful plant . It means the use of a greater American common sense in discarding rumor and distorted statement . It means recognizing , for what they are , racketeers and fifth columnists , who are the incendiary bombs in this country of the moment . All of us know that we have made very great social progress in recent years . We propose to maintain that progress and strengthen it . When the Nation is threatened from without , however , as it is today , the actual production and transportation of the machinery of defense must not be interrupted by disputes between capital and capital , labor and labor , or capital and labor . The future of all free enterprise of capital and labor alike is at stake . This is no time for capital to make , or be allowed to retain , excess profits . Articles of defense must have undisputed right of way in every industrial plant in the country . A Nation wide machinery for conciliation and mediation of industrial disputes has been set up . That machinery must be used promptly and without stoppage of work . Collective bargaining will be retained , but the American people expect that impartial recommendations of our Government conciliation and mediation services will be followed both by capital and by labor . The overwhelming majority of our citizens expect their Government to see that the tools of defense are built and for the very purpose of preserving the democratic safeguards of both labor and management , this Government is determined to use all of its power to express the will of its people , and to prevent interference with the production of materials essential to our Nation s security . Today the whole world is divided between human slavery and human freedom between pagan brutality and the Christian ideal . We choose human freedom which is the Christian ideal . No one of us can waver for a moment in his courage or his faith . We will not accept a Hitler dominated world . And we will not accept a world , like the postwar world of the 1920 s , in which the seeds of Hitlerism can again be planted and allowed to grow . We will accept only a world consecrated to freedom of speech and expression freedom of every person to worship God in his own way freedom from want and freedom from terror . Is such a world impossible of attainment Magna Charta , the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution of the United States , the Emancipation Proclamation , and every other milestone in human progress all were ideals which seemed impossible of attainment and yet they were attained . As a military force , we were weak when we established our independence , but we successfully stood off tyrants , powerful in their day , tyrants who are now lost in the dust of history . Odds meant nothing to us then . Shall we now , with all our potential strength , hesitate to take every single measure necessary to maintain our American liberties Our people and our Government will not hesitate to meet that challenge . As the President of a united and determined people , I say solemnly We reassert the ancient American doctrine of freedom of the seas . We reassert the solidarity of the twenty one American Republics and the Dominion of Canada in the preservation of the independence of the hemisphere . We have pledged material support to the other democracies of the world and we will fulfill that pledge . We in the Americas will decide for ourselves whether , and when , and where , our American interests are attacked or our security is threatened . We are placing our armed forces in strategic military position . We will not hesitate to use our armed forces to repel attack . We reassert our abiding faith in the vitality of our constitutional Republic as a perpetual home of freedom , of tolerance , and of devotion to the word of God . Therefore , with profound consciousness of my responsibilities to my countrymen and to my country s cause , I have tonight issued a proclamation that an unlimited national emergency exists and requires the strengthening of our defense to the extreme limit of our national power and authority . The Nation will expect all individuals and all groups to play their full parts , without stint , and without selfishness , and without doubt that our democracy will triumphantly survive . I repeat the words of the signers of the Declaration of Independence that little band of patriots , fighting long ago against overwhelming odds , but certain , as we are now , of ultimate victory With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor .<speech_sep>My friends I wish that all the Americans people could read all the citations for various medals recommended for our soldiers and sailors and marines . I am picking out one of these citations which tells of the accomplishments of Lieutenant John James Powers , United States Navy , during three days of the battles with Japanese forces in the Coral Sea . During the first two days , Lieutenant Powers , flying a dive bomber in the face of blasting enemy anti aircraft fire , demolished one large enemy gunboat , put another gunboat out of commission , severely damaged an aircraft tender and a twenty thousand ton transport , and scored a direct hit on an aircraft carrier which burst into flames and sank soon after . The official citation then describes the morning of the third day of battle . As the pilots of his squadron left the ready room to man their planes , Lieutenant Powers said to them , Remember , the folks back home are counting on us . I am going to get a hit if I have to lay it on their flight deck . He led his section down to the target from an altitude of 18 , 000 feet , through a wall of bursting anti aircraft shells and swarms of enemy planes . He dived almost to the very deck of the enemy carrier , and did not release his bomb until he was sure of a direct hit . He was last seen attempting recovery from his dive at the extremely low altitude of two hundred feet , amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragments , and smoke and flame and debris from the stricken vessel . His own plane was destroyed by the explosion of his own bomb . But he had made good his promise to lay it on the flight deck . I have received a recommendation from the Secretary of the Navy that Lieutenant John James Powers of New York City , missing in action , be awarded the Medal of Honor . I hereby and now make this award . You and I are the folks back home for whose protection Lieutenant Powers fought and repeatedly risked his life . He said that we counted on him and his men . We did not count in vain . But have not those men a right to be counting on us How are we playing our part back home in winning this war The answer is that we are not doing enough . Today I sent a message to the Congress , pointing out the overwhelming urgency of the serious domestic economic crisis with which we are threatened . Some call it inflation , which is a vague sort of term , and others call it a rise in the cost of living , which is much more easily understood by most families . That phrase , the cost of living , means essentially what a dollar can buy . From January 1 , 1941 , to May of this year , nearly a year and a half , the cost of living went up about 15 . And at that point last May we undertook to freeze the cost of living . But we could not do a complete job of it , because the Congressional authority at the time exempted a large part of farm products used for food and for making clothing , although several weeks before , I had asked the Congress for legislation to stabilize all farm prices . At that time I had told the Congress that there were seven elements in our national economy , all of which had to be controlled and that if any one essential element remained exempt , the cost of living could not be held down . On only two of these points both of them vital however did I call for Congressional action . These two vital points were First , taxation and , second , the stabilization of all farm prices at parity . Parity is a standard for the maintenance of good farm prices . It was established as our national policy way back in 1933 . It means that the farmer and the city worker are on the same relative ratio with each other in purchasing power as they were during a period some thirty years ago before at a time then the farmer had a satisfactory purchasing power . 100 percent of parity , therefore , has been accepted by farmers as the fair standard for the prices they receive . Last January , however , the Congress passed a law forbidding ceilings on farm prices below 110 percent of parity on some commodities . And on other commodities the ceiling was even higher , so that the average possible ceiling is now about 116 percent of parity for agricultural products as a whole . This act of favoritism for one particular group in the community increased the cost of food to everybody not only to the workers in the city or in the munitions plants , and their families , but also to the families of the farmers themselves . Since last May , ceilings have been set on nearly all commodities , rents and services , except the exempted farm products . Installment buying , for example , has been effectively effectually stabilized and controlled . Wages in certain key industries have been stabilized on the basis of the present cost of living . But it is obvious to all of us however that if the cost of food continues to go up , as it is doing at present , the wage earner , particularly in the lower brackets , will have a right to an increase in his wages . I think that would be essential justice and a practical necessity . Our experience with the control of other prices during the past few months has brought out one important fact the rising cost of living can be controlled , providing that all elements making up the cost of living are controlled at the same time . I think that also is an essential justice and a practical necessity . We know that parity prices for farm products not now controlled will not put up the cost of living more than a very small amount but we also know that if we must go up to an average of 116 of parity for food and other farm products which is necessary at present under the Emergency Price Control Act before we can control all farm prices the cost of living will get well out of hand . We are face to face with this danger today . Let us meet it and remove it . I realize that it may seem out of proportion to you to be worrying about over stressing these economic problems at a time like this , when we are all deeply concerned about the news from far distant fields of battle . But I give you the solemn assurance that failure to solve this problem here at home and to solve it now will make more difficult the winning of this war . If the vicious spiral of inflation ever gets under way , the whole economic system will stagger . Prices and wages will go up so rapidly that the entire production program will be endangered . The cost of the war , paid by taxpayers , will jump beyond all present calculations . It will mean an uncontrollable rise in prices and in wages , which can result in raising the overall cost of living as high as another 20 percent soon . That would mean that the purchasing power of every dollar that you have in your pay envelope , or in the bank , or included in your insurance policy or your pension , would be reduced to about eighty cents worth . I need not tell you that this would have a demoralizing effect on our people , soldiers and civilians alike . Overall stabilization of prices , and salaries , and wages and profits is necessary to the continued increasing production of planes and tanks and ships and guns . In my Message to Congress today , I have told the Congress said that this must be done quickly . If we wait for two or three or four or six months it may well be too late . I have told the Congress that the Administration can not hold the actual cost of food and clothing down to the present level beyond October first . Therefore , I have asked the Congress to pass legislation under which the President would be specifically authorized to stabilize the cost of living , including the price of all farm commodities . The purpose should be to hold farm prices at parity , or at levels of a recent date , whichever is higher . The purpose should also be to keep wages at a point stabilized with today s cost of living . Both must be regulated at the same time and neither one of them can or should be regulated without the other . At the same time that farm prices are stabilized , I will stabilize wages . That is plain justice and plain common sense . And so I have asked the Congress to take this action by the first of October . We must now act with the dispatch , which the stern necessities of war require . I have told the Congress that inaction on their part by that date will leave me with an inescapable responsibility , a responsibility to the people of this country to see to it that the war effort is no longer imperiled by the threat of economic chaos . As I said in my Message to the Congress In the event that the Congress should fail to act , and act adequately , I shall accept the responsibility , and I will act . The President has the powers , under the Constitution and under Congressional Acts , to take measures necessary to avert a disaster which would interfere with the winning of the war . I have given the most careful and thoughtful consideration to meeting this issue without further reference to the Congress . I have determined , however , on this vital matter to consult with the Congress . There may be those who will say that , if the situation is as grave as I have stated it to be , I should use my powers and act now . I can only say that I have approached this problem from every angle , and that I have decided that the course of conduct which I am following in this case is consistent with my sense of responsibility as President in time of war , and with my deep and unalterable devotion to the processes of democracy . The responsibilities of the President in wartime to protect the Nation are very grave . This total war , with our fighting fronts all over the world , makes the use of the executive power far more essential than in any previous war . If we were invaded , the people of this country would expect the President to use any and all means to repel the invader . Now the Revolution and the War between the States were fought on our own soil , but today this war will be won or lost on other continents and in remote seas . I cannot tell what powers may have to be exercised in order to win this war . The American people can be sure that I will use my powers with a full sense of responsibility to the Constitution and to my country . The American people can also be sure that I shall not hesitate to use every power vested in me to accomplish the defeat of our enemies in any part of the world where our own safety demands such defeat . And when the war is won , the powers under which I act will automatically revert to the people of the United States to the people to whom they those powers belong . I think I know the American farmers . I know that they are as wholehearted in their patriotism as any other group . They have suffered from the constant fluctuations of farm prices occasionally too high , more often too low . Nobody knows better than farmers the disastrous effects of wartime inflationary booms , and post war deflationary panics . So I have also suggested today suggested that the Congress make our agricultural economy more stable . I have recommended that in addition to putting ceilings on all farm products now , we also place a definite floor under those prices for a period beginning now , continuing through the war , and for as long as necessary after the war . In this way we will be able to avoid the collapse of farm prices which that happened after the last war . The farmers must be assured of a fair minimum price during the readjustment period which will follow the great , excessive world food demands which that now prevail . We must have some floor under farm prices , as we must have under wages , if we are to avoid the dangers of a post war inflation on the one hand , or the catastrophe of a crash in farm prices and wages on the other . Today I have also advised the Congress of the importance of speeding up the passage of the tax bill . The Federal Treasury is losing millions of dollars a each and every day because the bill has not yet been passed . Taxation is the only practical way of preventing the incomes and profits of individuals and corporations from getting too high . I have told the Congress once more that all net individual incomes , after payment of all taxes , should be limited effectively by further taxation to a maximum net income of 25 , 000 25 thousand dollars a year . And it is equally important that corporate profits should not exceed a reasonable amount in any case . The nation must have more money to run the War . People must stop spending for luxuries . Our country needs a far greater share of our incomes . For this is a global war , and it will cost this nation nearly one hundred billion dollars in 1943 . In that global war there are now four main areas of combat and I should like to speak briefly of them , not in the order of their importance , for all of them are vital and all of them are interrelated . 1 The Russian front . Here the Germans are still unable to gain the smashing victory which , almost a year ago , Hitler announced he had already achieved . Germany has been able to capture important Russian territory . Nevertheless , Hitler has been unable to destroy a single Russian Army and this , you may be sure , has been , and still is , his main objective . Millions of German troops seem doomed to spend another cruel and bitter winter on the Russian front . Yes , the Russians are killing more Nazis , and destroying more airplanes and tanks than are being smashed on any other front . They are fighting not only bravely but brilliantly . In spite of any setbacks Russia will hold out , and with the help of her Allies will ultimately drive every Nazi from her soil . 2 The Pacific Ocean Area . This area must be grouped together as a whole every part of it , land and sea . We have stopped one major Japanese offensive and we have inflicted heavy losses on their fleet . But they still possess great strength they seek to keep the initiative and they will undoubtedly strike hard again . We must not over rate the importance of our successes in the Solomon Islands , though we may be proud of the skill with which these local operations were conducted . At the same time , we need not under rate the significance of our victory at Midway . There we stopped the major Japanese offensive . 3 In the Mediterranean and the Middle East area the British , together with the South Africans , Australians , New Zealanders , Indian troops and others of the United Nations , including ourselves , are fighting a desperate battle with the Germans and Italians . The Axis powers are fighting to gain control of that area , dominate the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , and gain contact with the Japanese Navy . The battle in the Middle East is now joined . We are well aware of our danger , but we are hopeful of the outcome . 4 The European area . Here the aim is an offensive against Germany . There are at least a dozen different points at which attacks can be launched . You , of course , do not expect me to give details of future plans , but you can rest assured that preparations are being made here and in Britain toward this purpose . The power of Germany must be broken on the battlefields of Europe . Various people urge that we concentrate our forces on one or another of these four areas , although no one suggests that any one of the four areas should be abandoned . Certainly , it could not be seriously urged that we abandon aid to Russia , or that we surrender all of the Pacific to Japan , or the Mediterranean and Middle East to Germany , or give up an offensive against Germany . The American people may be sure that we shall neglect none of the four great theaters of war . Certain vital military decisions have been made . In due time you will know what these decisions are and so will our enemies . I can say now that all of these decisions are directed toward taking the offensive . Today , exactly nine months after Pearl Harbor , we have sent overseas three times more men than we transported to France in the first nine months of the first World War . We have done this in spite of greater danger and fewer ships . And every week sees a gain in the actual number of American men and weapons in the fighting areas . These reinforcements in men and munitions are continuing , and will continue to go forward . This war will finally be won by the coordination of all the armies , navies and air forces of all of the United Nations operating in unison against our enemies . This will require vast assemblies of weapons and men at all the vital points of attack . We and our allies have worked for years to achieve superiority in weapons . We have no doubts about the superiority of our men . We glory in the individual exploits of our soldiers , our sailors , our marines , our merchant seamen . Lieutenant John James Powers was one of these and there are thousands of others in the forces of the United Nations . Several thousand Americans have met death in battle . Other thousands will lose their lives . But many millions stand ready to step into their places to engage in a struggle to the very death . For they know that the enemy is determined to destroy us , our homes and our institutions that in this war it is kill or be killed . Battles are not won by soldiers or sailors who think first of their own personal safety . And wars are not won by people who are concerned primarily with their own comfort , their own convenience , their own pocketbooks . We Americans of today bear the gravest of responsibilities . And all of the United Nations share them . All of us here at home are being tested for our fortitude , for our selfless devotion to our country and to our cause . This is the toughest war of all time . We need not leave it to historians of the future to answer the question whether we are tough enough to meet this unprecedented challenge . We can give that answer now . The answer is Yes .<speech_sep>Vice President , and Speaker , and Members of the Senate and House of Representatives Yesterday , December 7 , 1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan . The United States was at peace with that Nation and , at the solicitation of Japan , was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific . Indeed , one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American Island of Oahu , the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message . And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations , it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack . It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago . During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace . The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces . I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost . In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu . Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya . Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong . Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam . Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands . Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island . And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island . Japan has , therefore , undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area . The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves . The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our Nation . As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense . But always will our whole Nation remember the character of the onslaught against us . No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion , the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory . I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us . Hostilities exist . There is no blinking at the fact that our people , our territory , and our interests are in grave danger . With confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people we will gain the inevitable triumph , so help us God . I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday , December 7 , 1941 , a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire .<speech_sep>I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking but more particularly with the overwhelming majority who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing of checks . I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days , why it was done , and what the next steps are going to be . I recognize that the many proclamations from State Capitols and from Washington , the legislation , the Treasury regulations , etc . , couched for the most part in banking and legal terms should be explained for the benefit of the average citizen . I owe this in particular because of the fortitude and good temper with which everybody has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the banking holiday . I know that when you understand what we in Washington have been about I shall continue to have your cooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and help during the past week . First of all let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit vault . It invests your money in many different forms of credit bonds , commercial paper , mortgages and many other kinds of loans . In other words , the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning around . A comparatively small part of the money you put into the bank is kept in currency an amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the cash needs of the average citizen . In other words the total amount of all the currency in the country is only a small fraction of the total deposits in all of the banks . What , then , happened during the last few days of February and the first few days of March Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public , there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold . A rush so great that the soundest banks could not get enough currency to meet the demand . The reason for this was that on the spur of the moment it was , of course , impossible to sell perfectly sound assets of a bank and convert them into cash except at panic prices far below their real value . By the afternoon of March 3 scarcely a bank in the country was open to do business . Proclamations temporarily closing them in whole or in part had been issued by the Governors in almost all the states . It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the nation wide bank holiday , and this was the first step in the Government s reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric . The second step was the legislation promptly and patriotically passed by the Congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers so that it became possible in view of the requirement of time to entend sic the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually . This law also gave authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of our banking facilities . I want to tell our citizens in every part of the Nation that the national Congress Republicans and Democrats alike showed by this action a devotion to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that it is difficult to match in our history . The third stage has been the series of regulations permitting the banks to continue their functions to take care of the distribution of food and household necessities and the payment of payrolls . This bank holiday while resulting in many cases in great inconvenience is affording us the opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation . No sound bank is a dollar worse off than it was when it closed its doors last Monday . Neither is any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for immediate opening . The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call . The new currency is being sent out by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in large volume to every part of the country . It is sound currency because it is backed by actual , good assets . A question you will ask is this why are all the banks not to be reopened at the same time The answer is simple . Your Government does not intend that the history of the past few years shall be repeated . WE do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank failures . As a result we start tomorrow , Monday , with the opening of banks in the twelve Federal Reserve Bank cities those banks which on first examination by the Treasury have already been found to be all right . This will be followed on Tuesday by the resumption of all their functions by banks already found to be sound in cities where there are recognized clearinghouses . That means about 250 cities of the United States . On Wednesday and succeeding days banks in smaller places all through the country will resume business , subject , of course , to the Government s physical ability to complete its survey . It is necessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period in order to permit the banks to make applications for necessary loans , to obtain currency needed to meet their requirements and to enable the Government to make common sense checkups . Let me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the first day you are by no means justified in believing that it will not open . A bank that opens on one of the subsequent days is in exactly the same status as the bank that opens tomorrow . I know that many people are worrying about State banks not members of the Federal Reserve System . These banks can and will receive assistance from member banks and from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . These state banks are following the same course as the national banks except that they get their licenses to resume business from the state authorities , and these authorities have been asked by the Secretary of the Treasury to permit their good banks to open up on the same schedule as the national banks . I am confident that the state banking departments will be as careful as the National Government in the policy relating to the opening of banks and will follow the same broad policy . It is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who have not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals . Let me make it clear that the banks will take care of all needs and it is my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime . It needs no prophet to tell you that when the people find that they can get their money that they can get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes the phantom of fear will soon be laid . People will again be glad to have their money where it will be safely taken care of and where they can use it conveniently at any time . I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress . The success of our whole great national program depends , of course , upon the cooperation of the public on its intelligent support and use of a reliable system . Remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation is that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert their assets into cash than was the case before . More liberal provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the Reserve Banks and more liberal provision has also been made for issuing currency on the security of those good assets . This currency is not fiat currency . It is issued only on adequate security and every good bank has an abundance of such security . One more point before I close . There will be , of course , some banks unable to reopen without being reorganized . The new law allows the Government to assist in making these reorganizations quickly and effectively and even allows the Government to subscribe to at least a part of new capital which may be required . I hope you can see from this elemental recital of what your government is doing that there is nothing complex , or radical in the process . We had a bad banking situation . Some of our bankers had shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the people s funds . They had used the money entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans . This was of course not true in the vast majority of our banks but it was true in enough of them to shock the people for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put them into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate , but seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted them all . It was the Government s job to straighten out this situation and do it as quickly as possible and the job is being performed . I do not promise you that every bank will be reopened or that individual losses will not be suffered , but there will be no losses that possibly could be avoided and there would have been more and greater losses had we continued to drift . I can even promise you salvation for some at least of the sorely pressed banks . We shall be engaged not merely in reopening sound banks but in the creation of sound banks through reorganization . It has been wonderful to me to catch the note of confidence from all over the country . I can never be sufficiently grateful to the people for the loyal support they have given me in their acceptance of the judgment that has dictated our course , even though all of our processes may not have seemed clear to them . After all there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency , more important than gold , and that is the confidence of the people . Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan . You people must have faith you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses . Let us unite in banishing fear . We have provided the machinery to restore our financial system it is up to you to support and make it work . It is your problem no less than it is mine . Together we cannot fail .<speech_sep>Members of the Convention my friends It is very late but I have felt that you would rather that I speak to you now than wait until tomorrow . It is with a very full heart that I speak tonight . I must confess that I do so with mixed feelings because I find myself , as almost everyone does sooner or later in his lifetime , in a conflict between deep personal desire for retirement on the one hand , and that quiet , invisible thing called conscience on the other . Because there are self appointed commentators and interpreters who will seek to misinterpret or question motives , I speak in a somewhat personal vein and I must trust to the good faith and common sense of the American people to accept my own good faith and to do their own interpreting . When , in 1936 , I was chosen by the voters for a second time as President , it was my firm intention to turn over the responsibilities of Government to other hands at the end of my term . That conviction remained with me . Eight years in the Presidency , following a period of bleak depression , and covering one world crisis after another , would normally entitle any man to the relaxation that comes from honorable retirement . During the spring of 1939 , world events made it clear to all but the blind or the partisan that a great war in Europe had become not merely a possibility but a probability , and that such a war would of necessity deeply affect the future of this nation . When the conflict first broke out last September , it was still my intention to announce clearly and simply , at an early date , that under no conditions would I accept reelection . This fact was well known to my friends , and I think was understood by many citizens . It soon became evident , however , that such a public statement on my part would be unwise from the point of view of sheer public duty . As President of the United States , it was my clear duty , with the aid of the Congress , to preserve our neutrality , to shape our program of defense , to meet rapid changes , to keep our domestic affairs adjusted to shifting world conditions , and to sustain the policy of the Good Neighbor . It was also my obvious duty to maintain to the utmost the influence of this mighty nation in our effort to prevent the spread of war , and to sustain by all legal means those governments threatened by other governments which had rejected the principles of democracy . Swiftly moving foreign events made necessary swift action at home and beyond the seas . Plans for national defense had to be expanded and adjusted to meet new forms of warfare . American citizens and their welfare had to be safeguarded in many foreign zones of danger . National unity in the United States became a crying essential in the face of the development of unbelievable types of espionage and international treachery . Every day that passed called for the postponement of personal plans and partisan debate until the latest possible moment . The normal conditions under which I would have made public declaration of my personal desires were wholly gone . And so , thinking solely of the national good and of the international scene , I came to the reluctant conclusion that such declaration should not be made before the national Convention . It was accordingly made to you within an hour after the permanent organization of this Convention . Like any other man , I am complimented by the honor you have done me . But I know you will understand the spirit in which I say that no call of Party alone would prevail upon me to accept reelection to the Presidency . The real decision to be made in these circumstances is not the acceptance of a nomination , but rather an ultimate willingness to serve if chosen by the electorate of the United States . Many considerations enter into this decision . During the past few months , with due Congressional approval , we in the United States have been taking steps to implement the total defense of America . I cannot forget that in carrying out this program I have drafted into the service of the nation many men and women , taking them away from important private affairs , calling them suddenly from their homes and their businesses . I have asked them to leave their own work , and to contribute their skill and experience to the cause of their nation . as the head of their Government , have asked them to do this . Regardless of party , regardless of personal convenience , they came they answered the call . Every single one of them , with one exception , has come to the nation s Capital to serve the nation . These people , who have placed patriotism above all else , represent those who have made their way to what might be called the top of their professions or industries through their proven skill and experience . But they alone could not be enough to meet the needs of the times . Just as a system of national defense based on man power alone , without the mechanized equipment of modern warfare , is totally insufficient for adequate national defense , so also planes and guns and tanks are wholly insufficient unless they are implemented by the power of men trained to use them . Such man power consists not only of pilots and gunners and infantry and those who operate tanks . For every individual in actual combat service , it is necessary for adequate defense that we have ready at hand at least four or five other trained individuals organized for non combat services . Because of the millions of citizens involved in the conduct of defense , most right thinking persons are agreed that some form of selection by draft is as necessary and fair today as it was in 1917 and 1918 . Nearly every American is willing to do his share or her share to defend the United States . It is neither just nor efficient to permit that task to fall upon any one section or any one group . For every section and every group depend for their existence upon the survival of the nation as a whole . Lying awake , as I have , on many nights , I have asked myself whether I have the right , as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy , to call on men and women to serve their country or to train themselves to serve and , at the same time , decline to serve my country in my own personal capacity , if I am called upon to do so by the people of my country . In times like these in times of great tension , of great crisis the compass of the world narrows to a single fact . The fact which dominates our world is the fact of armed aggression , the fact of successful armed aggression , aimed at the form of Government , the kind of society that we in the United States have chosen and established for ourselves . It is a fact which no one longer doubts , which no one is longer able to ignore . It is not an ordinary war . It is a revolution imposed by force of arms , which threatens all men everywhere . It is a revolution which proposes not to set men free but to reduce them to slavery to reduce them to slavery in the interest of a dictatorship which has already shown the nature and the extent of the advantage which it hopes to obtain . That is the fact which dominates our world and which dominates the lives of all of us , each and every one of us . In the face of the danger which confronts our time , no individual retains or can hope to retain , the right of personal choice which free men enjoy in times of peace . He has a first obligation to serve in the defense of our institutions of freedom a first obligation to serve his country in whatever capacity his country finds him useful . Like most men of my age , I had made plans for myself , plans for a private life of my own choice and for my own satisfaction , a life of that kind to begin in January , 1941 . These plans , like so many other plans , had been made in a world which now seems as distant as another planet . Today all private plans , all private lives , have been in a sense repealed by an overriding public danger . In the face of that public danger all those who can be of service to the Republic have no choice but to offer themselves for service in those capacities for which they may be fitted . Those , my friends , are the reasons why I have had to admit to myself , and now to state to you , that my conscience will not let me turn my back upon a call to service . The right to make that call rests with the people through the American method of a free election . Only the people themselves can draft a President . If such a draft should be made upon me , I say to you , in the utmost simplicity , I will , with God s help , continue to serve with the best of my ability and with the fullness of my strength . To you , the delegates of this Convention , I express my gratitude for the selection of Henry Wallace for the high office of Vice President of the United States . His first hand knowledge of the problems of Government in every sphere of life and in every single part of the nation and indeed of the whole world qualifies him without reservation . His practical idealism will be of great service to me individually and to the nation as a whole . And to the Chairman of the National Committee , the Postmaster General of the United States my old friend Jim Farley I send , as I have often before and shall many times again , my most affectionate greetings . All of us are sure that he will continue to give all the leadership and support that he possibly can to the cause of American democracy . In some respects , as I think my good wife suggested an hour or so ago the next few months will be different from the usual national campaigns of recent years . Most of you know how important it is that the President of the United States in these days remain close to the seat of Government . Since last Summer I have been compelled to abandon proposed journeys to inspect many of our great national projects from the Alleghenies to the Pacific Coast . Events move so fast in other parts of the world that it has be come my duty to remain either in the White House itself or at some near by point where I can reach Washington and even Europe and Asia by direct telephone where , if need be , I can be back at my desk in the space of a very few hours . And in addition , the splendid work of the new defense machinery will require me to spend vastly more time in conference with the responsible administration heads under me . Finally , the added task which the present crisis has imposed also upon the Congress , compelling them to forego their usual adjournment , calls for constant cooperation between the Executive and Legislative branches , to the efficiency of which I am glad indeed now to pay tribute . I do expect , of course , during the coming months to make my usual periodic reports to the country through the medium of press conferences and radio talks . I shall not have the time or the inclination to engage in purely political debate . But I shall never be loath to call the attention of the nation to deliberate or unwitting falsifications of fact , which are sometimes made by political candidates . I have spoken to you in a very informal and personal way . The exigencies of the day require , however , that I also talk with you about things which transcend any personality and go very deeply to the roots of American civilization . Our lives have been based on those fundamental freedoms and liberties which we Americans have cherished for a century and a half . The establishment of them and the preservation of them in each succeeding generation have been accomplished through the processes of free elective Government the democratic republican form , based on the representative system and the coordination of the executive , the legislative and the judicial branches . The task of safeguarding our institutions seems to me to be twofold . One must be accomplished , if it becomes necessary , by the armed defense forces of the nation . The other , by the united effort of the men and women of the country to make our Federal and State and local Governments responsive to the growing requirements of modern democracy . There have been occasions , as we remember , when reactions in the march of democracy have set in , and forward looking progress has seemed to stop . But such periods have been followed by liberal and progressive times which have enabled the nation to catch up with new developments in fulfilling new human needs . Such a time has been the past seven years . Because we had seemed to lag in previous years , we have had to develop , speedily and efficiently , the answers to aspirations which had come from every State and every family in the land . We have sometimes called it social legislation we have sometimes called it legislation to end the abuses of the past we have sometimes called it legislation for human security and we have sometimes called it legislation to better the condition of life of the many millions of our fellow citizens , who could not have the essentials of life or hope for an American standard of living . Some of us have labeled it a wider and more equitable distribution of wealth in our land . It has included among its aims , to liberalize and broaden the control of vast industries lodged today in the hands of a relatively small group of individuals of very great financial power . But all of these definitions and labels are essentially the expression of one consistent thought . They represent a constantly growing sense of human decency , human decency throughout our nation . This sense of human decency is happily confined to no group or class . You find it in the humblest home . You find it among those who toil , and among the shopkeepers and the farmers of the nation . You find it , to a growing degree , even among those who are listed in that top group which has so much control over the industrial and financial structure of the nation . Therefore , this urge of humanity can by no means be labeled a war of class against class . It is rather a war against poverty and suffering and ill health and insecurity , a war in which all classes are joining in the interest of a sound and enduring democracy . I do not believe for a moment , and I know that you do not believe either , that we have fully answered all the needs of human security . But we have covered much of the road . I need not catalogue the milestones of seven years . For every individual and every family in the whole land know that the average of their personal lives has been made safer and sounder and happier than it has ever been before . I do not think they want the gains in these directions to be repealed or even to be placed in the charge of those who would give them mere lip service with no heart service . Yes , very much more remains to be done , and I think the voters want the task entrusted to those who believe that the words human betterment apply to poor and rich alike . And I have a sneaking suspicion too , that voters will smile at charges of inefficiency against a Government which has boldly met the enormous problems of banking , and finance and industry which the great efficient bankers and industrialists of the Republican Party left in such hopeless chaos in the famous year 1933 . But we all know that our progress at home and in the other American nations toward this realization of a better human decency progress along free lines is gravely endangered by what is happening on other continents . In Europe , many nations , through dictatorships or invasions , have been compelled to abandon normal democratic processes . They have been compelled to adopt forms of government which some call new and efficient . They are not new , my friends , they are only a relapse a relapse into ancient history . The omnipotent rulers of the greater part of modern Europe have guaranteed efficiency , and work , and a type of security . But the slaves who built the pyramids for the glory of the dictator Pharaohs of Egypt had that kind of security , that kind of efficiency , that kind of corporative state . So did the inhabitants of that world which extended from Britain to Persia under the undisputed rule of the proconsuls sent out from Rome . So did the henchmen , the tradesmen , the mercenaries and the slaves of the feudal system which dominated Europe a thousand years ago . So did the people of those nations of Europe who received their kings and their government at the whim of the conquering Napoleon . Whatever its new trappings and new slogans , tyranny is the oldest and most discredited rule known to history . And whenever tyranny has replaced a more human form of Government it has been due more to internal causes than external . Democracy can thrive only when it enlists the devotion of those whom Lincoln called the common people . Democracy can hold that devotion only when it adequately respects their dignity by so ordering society as to assure to the masses of men and women reasonable security and hope for themselves and for their children . We in our democracy , and those who live in still unconquered democracies , will never willingly descend to any form of this so called security of efficiency which calls for the abandonment of other securities more vital to the dignity of man . It is our credo unshakable to the end that we must live under the liberties that were first heralded by Magna Carta and placed into glorious operation through the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights . The Government of the United States for the past seven years has had the courage openly to oppose by every peaceful means the spread of the dictator form of Government . If our Government should pass to other hands next January untried hands , inexperienced hands we can merely hope and pray that they will not substitute appeasement and compromise with those who seek to destroy all democracies everywhere , including here . I would not undo , if I could , the efforts I made to prevent war from the moment it was threatened and to restrict the area of carnage , down to the last minute . I do not now soften the condemnation expressed by Secretary Hull and myself from time to time for the acts of aggression that have wiped out ancient liberty loving , peace pursuing countries which had scrupulously maintained neutrality . I do not recant the sentiments of sympathy with all free peoples resisting such aggression , or begrudge the material aid that we have given to them . I do not regret my consistent endeavor to awaken this country to the menace for us and for all we hold dear . I have pursued these efforts in the face of appeaser fifth columnists who charged me with hysteria and war mongering . But I felt it my duty , my simple , plain , inescapable duty , to arouse my countrymen to the danger of the new forces let loose in the world . So long as I am President , I will do all I can to insure that that foreign policy remain our foreign policy . All that I have done to maintain the peace of this country and to prepare it morally , as well as physically , for whatever contingencies may be in store , I submit to the judgment of my countrymen . We face one of the great choices of history . It is not alone a choice of Government by the people versus dictatorship . It is not alone a choice of freedom versus slavery . It is not alone a choice between moving forward or falling back . It is all of these rolled into one . It is the continuance of civilization as we know it versus the ultimate destruction of all that we have held dear religion against godlessness the ideal of justice against the practice of force moral decency versus the firing squad courage to speak out , and to act , versus the false lullaby of appeasement . But it has been well said that a selfish and greedy people cannot be free . The American people must decide whether these things are worth making sacrifices of money , of energy , and of self . They will not decide by listening to mere words or by reading mere pledges , interpretations and claims . They will decide on the record the record as it has been made the record of things as they are . The American people will sustain the progress of a representative democracy , asking the Divine Blessing as they face the future with courage and with faith .<speech_sep>My Friends Yesterday , on June fourth , 1944 , Rome fell to American and Allied troops . The first of the Axis capitals is now in our hands . One up and two to go It is perhaps significant that the first of these capitals to fall should have the longest history of all of them . The story of Rome goes back to the time of the foundations of our civilization . We can still see there monuments of the time when Rome and the Romans controlled the whole of the then known world . That , too , is significant , for the United Nations are determined that in the future no one city and no one race will be able to control the whole of the world . In addition to the monuments of the older times , we also see in Rome the great symbol of Christianity , which has reached into almost every part of the world . There are other shrines and other churches in many places , but the churches and shrines of Rome are visible symbols of the faith and determination of the early saints and martyrs that Christianity should live and become universal . And tonight now it will be a source of deep satisfaction that the freedom of the Pope and the of Vatican City is assured by the armies of the United Nations . It is also significant that Rome has been liberated by the armed forces of many nations . The American and British armies who bore the chief burdens of battle found at their sides our own North American neighbors , the gallant Canadians . The fighting New Zealanders from the far South Pacific , the courageous French and the French Moroccans , the South Africans , the Poles and the East Indians all of them fought with us on the bloody approaches to the city of Rome . The Italians , too , forswearing a partnership in the Axis which they never desired , have sent their troops to join us in our battles against the German trespassers on their soil . The prospect of the liberation of Rome meant enough to Hitler and his generals to induce them to fight desperately at great cost of men and materials and with great sacrifice to their crumbling Eastern line and to their Western front . No thanks are due to them if Rome was spared the devastation which the Germans wreaked on Naples and other Italian cities . The Allied Generals maneuvered so skillfully that the Nazis could only have stayed long enough to damage Rome at the risk of losing their armies . But Rome is of course more than a military objective . Ever since before the days of the Caesars , Rome has stood as a symbol of authority . Rome was the Republic . Rome was the Empire . Rome was and is in a sense the Catholic Church , and Rome was the capital of a United Italy . Later , unfortunately , a quarter of a century ago , Rome became the seat of Fascism one of the three capitals of the Axis . For this a quarter century the Italian people were enslaved . They were and degraded by the rule of Mussolini from Rome . They will mark its liberation with deep emotion . In the north of Italy , the people are still dominated and threatened by the Nazi overlords and their Fascist puppets . Somehow , in the back of my head , I still remember a name Mussolini . Our victory comes at an excellent time , while our Allied forces are poised for another strike at western Europe and while the armies of other Nazi soldiers nervously await our assault . And in the meantime our gallant Russian Allies continue to make their power felt more and more . From a strictly military standpoint , we had long ago accomplished certain of the main objectives of our Italian campaign the control of the islands the major islands the control of the sea lanes of the Mediterranean to shorten our combat and supply lines , and the capture of the airports , such as the great airports of Foggia , south of Rome , from which we have struck telling blows on the continent the whole of the continent all the way up to the Russian front . It would be unwise to inflate in our own minds the military importance of the capture of Rome . We shall have to push through a long period of greater effort and fiercer fighting before we get into Germany itself . The Germans have retreated thousands of miles , all the way from the gates of Cairo , through Libya and Tunisia and Sicily and Southern Italy . They have suffered heavy losses , but not great enough yet to cause collapse . Germany has not yet been driven to surrender . Germany has not yet been driven to the point where she will be unable to recommence world conquest a generation hence . Therefore , the victory still lies some distance ahead . That distance will be covered in due time have no fear of that . But it will be tough and it will be costly , as I have told you many , many times . In Italy the people had lived so long under the corrupt rule of Mussolini that , in spite of the tinsel at the top you have seen the pictures of him their economic condition had grown steadily worse . Our troops have found starvation , malnutrition , disease , a deteriorating education and lowered public health all by products of the Fascist misrule . The task of the Allies in occupation has been stupendous . We have had to start at the very bottom , assisting local governments to reform on democratic lines . We have had to give them bread to replace that which was stolen out of their mouths by the Germans . We have had to make it possible for the Italians to raise and use their own local crops . We have to help them cleanse their schools of Fascist trappings . I think the American people as a whole approve the salvage of these human beings , who are only now learning to walk in a new atmosphere of freedom . Some of us may let our thoughts run to the financial cost of it . Essentially it is what we can call a form of relief . And at the same time , we hope that this relief will be an investment for the future an investment that will pay dividends by eliminating Fascism , by and ending any Italian desires to start another war of aggression in the future . And that means that they are dividends which justify such an investment , because they are additional supports for world peace . The Italian people are capable of self government . We do not lose sight of their virtues as a peace loving nation . We remember the many centuries in which the Italians were leaders in the arts and sciences , enriching the lives of all mankind . We remember the great sons of the Italian people Galileo and Marconi , Michelangelo and Dante and incidentally that fearless discoverer who typifies the courage of Italy Christopher Columbus . Italy cannot grow in stature by seeking to build up a great militaristic empire . Italians have been overcrowded within their own territories , but they do not need to try to conquer the lands of other peoples in order to find the breath of life . Other peoples may not want to be conquered . In the past , Italians have come by the millions into to the United States . They have been welcomed , they have prospered , they have become good citizens , community and governmental leaders . They are not Italian Americans . They are Americans Americans of Italian descent . The Italians have gone in great numbers to the other Americas Brazil and the Argentine , for example hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them . They have gone and to many other nations in every continent of the world , giving of their industry and their talents , and achieving success and the comfort of good living , and good citizenship . Italy should go on as a great mother nation , contributing to the culture and the progress and the goodwill of all mankind and developing her special talents in the arts and crafts and sciences , and preserving her historic and cultural heritage for the benefit of all peoples . We want and expect the help of the future Italy toward lasting peace . All the other nations opposed to Fascism and Nazism ought to should help to give Italy a chance . The Germans , after years of domination in Rome , left the people in the Eternal City on the verge of starvation . We and the British will do and are doing everything we can to bring them relief . Anticipating the fall of Rome , we made preparations to ship food supplies to the city , but , of course , it should be borne in mind that the needs are so great , and the transportation requirements of our armies so heavy that improvement must be gradual . But we have already begun to save the lives of the men , women and children of Rome . This , I think , is an example of the efficiency of your machinery of war . The magnificent ability and energy of the American people in growing the crops , building the merchant ships , in making and collecting the cargoes , in getting the supplies over thousands of miles of water , and thinking ahead to meet emergencies all this spells , I think , an amazing efficiency on the part of our armed forces , all the various agencies working with them , and American industry and labor as a whole . No great effort like this can be a hundred percent perfect , but the batting average is very , very high . And so I extend the congratulations and thanks tonight of the American people to General Alexander , who has been in command of the whole Italian operation to our General Clark and General Leese of the Fifth and the Eighth Armies to General Wilson , the Supreme Allied commander of the Mediterranean theater , to and General Devers his American Deputy to Lieutenant General Eaker to Admirals Cunningham and Hewitt and to all their brave officers and men . May God bless them and watch over them and over all of our gallant , fighting men .<speech_sep>President Newcomb , my friends of the University of Virginia I notice by the program that I am asked to address the class of 1940 . I avail myself of that privilege . But I also take this very apt occasion to speak to many other classes that have graduated through all the years , classes that are still in the period of study , not alone in the schools of learning of the Nation , but classes that have come up through the great schools of experience in other words a cross section of the country , just as you who graduate today are a cross section of the Nation as a whole . Every generation of young men and women in America has questions to ask the world . Most of the time they are the simple but nevertheless difficult questions , questions of work to do , opportunities to find , ambitions to satisfy . But every now and again in the history of the Republic a different kind of question presents itself a question that asks , not about the future of an individual or even of a generation , but about the future of the country , the future of the American people . There was such a time at the beginning of our history as a Nation . Young people asked themselves in those days what lay ahead , not for themselves , but for the new United States . There was such a time again in the seemingly endless years of the War Between the States . Young men and young women on both sides of the line asked themselves , not what trades or professions they would enter , what lives they would make , but what was to become of the country they had known . There is such a time again today . Again today the young men and the young women of America ask themselves with earnestness and with deep concern this same question What is to become of the country we know Now they ask it with even greater anxiety than before . They ask , not only what the future holds for this Republic , but what the future holds for all peoples and all nations that have been living under democratic forms of Government under the free institutions of a free people . It is understandable to all of us that they should ask this question . They read the words of those who are telling them that the ideal of individual liberty , the ideal of free franchise , the ideal of peace through justice , are decadent ideals . They read the word and hear the boast of those who say that a belief in force force directed by self chosen leaders is the new and vigorous system which will overrun the earth . They have seen the ascendancy of this philosophy of force in nation after nation where free institutions and individual liberties were once maintained . It is natural and understandable that the younger generation should first ask itself what the extension of the philosophy of force to all the world would lead to ultimately . We see today in stark reality some of the consequences of what we call the machine age . Where control of machines has been retained in the hands of mankind as a whole , untold benefits have accrued to mankind . For mankind was then the master and the machine was the servant . But in this new system of force the mastery of the machine is not in the hands of mankind . It is in the control of infinitely small groups of individuals who rule without a single one of the democratic sanctions that we have known . The machine in hands of irresponsible conquerors becomes the master mankind is not only the servant it is the victim , too . Such mastery abandons with deliberate contempt all the moral values to which even this young country for more than three hundred years has been accustomed and dedicated . Surely the new philosophy proves from month to month that it could have no possible conception of the way of life or the way of thought of a nation whose origins go back to Jamestown and Plymouth Rock . Conversely , neither those who spring from that ancient stock nor those who have come hither in later years can be indifferent to the destruction of freedom in their ancestral lands across the sea . Perception of danger to our institutions may come slowly or it may come with a rush and a shock as it has to the people of the United States in the past few months . This perception of danger has come to us clearly and overwhelmingly and we perceive the peril in a world wide arena an arena that may become so narrowed that only the Americas will retain the ancient faiths . Some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we of the United States can safely permit the United States to become a lone island , a lone island in a world dominated by the philosophy of force . Such an island may be the dream of those who still talk and vote as isolationists . Such an island represents to me and to the overwhelming majority of Americans today a helpless nightmare of a people without freedom the nightmare of a people lodged in prison , handcuffed , hungry , and fed through the bars from day to day by the contemptuous , unpitying masters of other continents . It is natural also that we should ask ourselves how now we can prevent the building of that prison and the placing of ourselves in the midst of it . Let us not hesitate all of us to proclaim certain truths . Overwhelmingly we , as a nation and this applies to all the other American nations are convinced that military and naval victory for the gods of force and hate would endanger the institutions of democracy in the western world , and that equally , therefore , the whole of our sympathies lies with those nations that are giving their life blood in combat against these forces . The people and the Government of the United States have seen with the utmost regret and with grave disquiet the decision of the Italian Government to engage in the hostilities now raging in Europe . More than three months ago the Chief of the Italian Government sent me word that because of the determination of Italy to limit , so far as might be possible , the spread of the European conflict , more than two hundred millions of people in the region of the Mediterranean had been enabled to escape the suffering and the devastation of war . I informed the Chief of the Italian Government that this desire on the part of Italy to prevent the war from spreading met with full sympathy and response on the part of the Government and the people of the United States , and I expressed the earnest hope of this Government and of this people that this policy on the part of Italy might be continued . I made it clear that in the opinion of the Government of the United States any extension of hostilities in the region of the Mediterranean might result in a still greater enlargement of the scene of the conflict , the conflict in the Near East and in Africa and that if this came to pass no one could foretell how much greater the theater of the war eventually might become . Again on a subsequent occasion , not so long ago , recognizing that certain aspirations of Italy might form the basis of discussions among the powers most specifically concerned , I offered , in a message addressed to the Chief of the Italian Government , to send to the Governments of France and of Great Britain such specific indications of the desires of Italy to obtain readjustments with regard to her position as the Chief of the Italian Government might desire to transmit through me . While making it clear that the Government of the United States in such an event could not and would not assume responsibility for the nature of the proposals submitted nor for agreements which might thereafter be reached , I proposed that if Italy would refrain from entering the war I would be willing to ask assurances from the other powers concerned that they would faithfully execute any agreement so reached and that Italy s voice in any future peace conference would have the same authority as if Italy had actually taken part in the war , as a belligerent . Unfortunately to the regret of all of us and the regret of humanity , the Chief of the Italian Government was unwilling to accept the procedure suggested and he has made no counter proposal . This Government directed its efforts to doing what it could to work for the preservation of peace in the Mediterranean area , and it likewise expressed its willingness to endeavor to cooperate with the Government of Italy when the appropriate occasion arose for the creation of a more stable world order , through the reduction of armaments , and through the construction of a more liberal international economic system which would assure to all powers equality of opportunity in the world s markets and in the securing of raw materials on equal terms . I have likewise , of course , felt it necessary in my communications to Signor Mussolini to express the concern of the Government of the United States because of the fact that any extension of the war in the region of the Mediterranean would inevitably result in great prejudice to the ways of life and Government and to the trade and commerce of all the American Republics . The Government of Italy has now chosen to preserve what it terms its freedom of action and to fulfill what it states are its promises to Germany . In so doing it has manifested disregard for the rights and security of other nations , disregard for the lives of the peoples of those nations which are directly threatened by this spread of the war and has evidenced its unwillingness to find the means through pacific negotiations for the satisfaction of what it believes are its legitimate aspirations . On this tenth day of June , nineteen hundred and forty , the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor . On this tenth day of June , nineteen hundred and forty , in this University founded by the first great American teacher of democracy , we send forth our prayers and our hopes to those beyond the seas who are maintaining with magnificent valor their battle for freedom . In our American unity , we will pursue two obvious and simultaneous courses we will extend to the opponents of force the material resources of this nation and , at the same time , we will harness and speed up the use of those resources in order that we ourselves in the Americas may have equipment and training equal to the task of any emergency and every defense . All roads leading to the accomplishment of these objectives must be kept clear of obstructions . We will not slow down or detour . Signs and signals call for speed full speed ahead . It is right that each new generation should ask questions . But in recent months the principal question has been somewhat simplified . Once more the future of the nation and of the American people is at stake . We need not and we will not , in any way , abandon our continuing effort to make democracy work within our borders . We still insist on the need for vast improvements in our own social and economic life . But that is a component part of national defense itself . The program unfolds swiftly and into that program will fit the responsibility and the opportunity of every man and woman in the land to preserve his and her heritage in days of peril . I call for effort , courage , sacrifice , devotion . Granting the love of freedom , all of these are possible . And the love of freedom is still fierce and steady in the nation today .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans As you know , I have recently come back from a trip of inspection of camps and training stations and war factories . The main thing that I observed on this trip is not exactly news . It is the plain fact that the American people are united as never before in their determination to do a job and to do it well . This whole nation of one hundred and thirty million free men , women and children is becoming one great fighting force . Some of us are soldiers or sailors , some of us are civilians . Some of us are fighting the war in airplanes five miles above the continent of Europe or the islands of the Pacific and some of us are fighting it in mines deep doom in the earth of Pennsylvania or Montana . A few of us are decorated with medals for heroic achievement , but all of us can have that deep and permanent inner satisfaction that comes from doing the best we know how each of us playing an honorable part in the great struggle to save our democratic civilization . Whatever our individual circumstances or opportunities we are all in it , and our spirit is good , and we Americans and our allies are going to win and do not let anyone tell you anything different . That is the main thing that I saw on my trip around the country unbeatable spirit . If the leaders of Germany and Japan could have come along with me , and had seen what I saw , they would agree with my conclusions . Unfortunately , they were unable to make the trip with me . And that is one reason why we are carrying our war effort overseas to them . With every passing week the war increases in scope and intensity . That is true in Europe , in Africa , in Asia , and on all the seas . The strength of the United Nations is on the upgrade in this war . The Axis leaders , on the other hand , know by now that they have already reached their full strength , and that their steadily mounting losses in men and material cannot be fully replaced . Germany and Japan are already realizing what the inevitable result will be when the total strength of the United Nations hits them at additional places on the earth s surface . One of the principal weapons of our enemies in the past has been their use of what is called The War of Nerves . They have spread falsehood and terror they have started Fifth Columns everywhere they have duped the innocent they have fomented suspicion and hate between neighbors they have aided and abetted those people in other nations even including our own whose words and deeds are advertised from Berlin and from Tokyo as proof of our disunity . The greatest defense against all such propaganda , of course , is the common sense of the common people and that defense is prevailing . The War of Nerves against the United Nations is now turning into a boomerang . For the first time , the Nazi propaganda machine is on the defensive . They begin to apologize to their own people for the repulse of their vast forces at Stalingrad , and for the enormous casualties they are suffering . They are compelled to beg their overworked people to rally their weakened production . They even publicly admit , for the first time , that Germany can be fed only at the cost of stealing food from the rest of Europe . They are proclaiming that a second front is impossible but , at the same time , they are desperately rushing troops in all directions , and stringing barbed wire all the way from the coasts of Finland and Norway to the islands of the Eastern Mediterranean . Meanwhile , they are driven to increase the fury of their atrocities . The United Nations have decided to establish the identity of those Nazi leaders who are responsible for the innumerable acts of savagery . As each of these criminal deeds is committed , it is being carefully investigated and the evidence is being relentlessly piled up for the future purposes of justice . We have made it entirely clear that the United Nations seek no mass reprisals against the populations of Germany or Italy or Japan . But the ring leaders and their brutal henchmen must be named , and apprehended , and tried in accordance with the judicial processes of criminal law . There are now millions of Americans in army camps , in naval stations , in factories and in shipyards . Who are these millions upon whom the life of our country depends What are they thinking What are their doubts and What are their hopes And how is the work progressing The Commander in Chief cannot learn all of the answers to these questions in Washington . And that is why I made the trip I did . It is very easy to say , as some have said , that when the President travels through the country he should go with a blare of trumpets , with crowds on the sidewalks , with batteries of reporters and photographers talking and posing with all of the politicians of the land . But having had some experience in this war and in the last war , I can tell you very simply that the kind of trip I took permitted me to concentrate on the work I had to do without expending time , meeting all the demands of publicity . And I might add it was a particular pleasure to make a tour of the country without having to give a single thought to politics . I expect to make other trips for similar purposes , and I shall make them in the same way . In the last war , I had seen great factories but until I saw some of the new present day plants , I had not thoroughly visualized our American war effort . Of course , I saw only a small portion of all our plants , but that portion was a good cross section , and it was deeply impressive . The United States has been at war for only ten months , and is engaged in the enormous task of multiplying its armed forces many times . We are by no means at full production level yet . But I could not help asking myself on the trip , where would we be today if the Government of the United States had not begun to build many of its factories for this huge increase more than two years ago , more than a year before war was forced upon us at Pearl Harbor We have also had to face the problem of shipping . Ships in every part of the world continue to be sunk by enemy action . But the total tonnage of ships coming out of American , Canadian and British shipyards , day by day , has increased so fast that we are getting ahead of our enemies in the bitter battle of transportation . In expanding our shipping , we have had to enlist many thousands of men for our Merchant Marine . These men are serving magnificently . They are risking their lives every hour so that guns and tanks and planes and ammunition and food may be carried to the heroic defenders of Stalingrad and to all the United Nations forces all over the world . A few days ago I awarded the first Maritime Distinguished Service Medal to a young man Edward Cheney of Yeadon , Pennsylvania who had shown great gallantry in rescuing his comrades from the oily waters of the sea after their ship had been torpedoed . There will be many more such acts of bravery . In one sense my recent trip was a hurried one , out through the Middle West , to the Northwest , down the length of the Pacific Coast and back through the Southwest and the South . In another sense , however , it was a leisurely trip , because I had the opportunity to talk to the people who are actually doing the work management and labor alike on their own home grounds . And it gave me a fine chance to do some thinking about the major problems of our war effort on the basis of first things first . As I told the three press association representatives who accompanied me , I was impressed by the large proportion of women employed doing skilled manual work labor running machines . As time goes on , and many more of our men enter the armed forces , this proportion of women will increase . Within less than a year from now , I think , there will probably be as many women as men working in our war production plants . I had some enlightening experiences relating to the old saying of us men that curiosity inquisitiveness is stronger among woman . I noticed that , frequently , that when we drove unannounced down the middle aisle of a great plant full of workers and machines , the first people to look up from their work were the men and not the women . It was chiefly the men who were arguing as to whether that fellow in the straw hat was really the President or not . So having seen the quality of the work and of the workers on our production lines and coupling these firsthand observations with the reports of actual performance of our weapons on the fighting fronts I can say to you that we are getting ahead of our enemies in the battle of production . And of great importance to our future production was the effective and rapid manner in which the Congress met the serious problem of the rising cost of living . It was a splendid example of the operation of democratic processes in wartime . The machinery to carry out this act of the Congress was put into effect within twelve hours after the bill was signed . The legislation will help the cost of living problems of every worker in every factory and on every farm in the land . In order to keep stepping up our production , we have had to add millions of workers to the total labor force of the Nation . And as new factories came into operation , we must find additional millions of workers . This presents a formidable problem in the mobilization of manpower . It is not that we do not have enough people in this country to do the job . The problem is to have the right numbers of the right people in the right places at the right time . We are learning to ration materials , and we must now learn to ration manpower . The major objectives of a sound manpower policy are First , to select and train men of the highest fighting efficiency needed for our armed forces in the achievement of victory over our enemies in combat . Second , to man our war industries and farms with the workers needed to produce the arms and munitions and food required by ourselves and by our fighting allies to win this war . In order to do this , we shall be compelled to stop workers from moving from one war job to another as a matter of personal preference to stop employers from stealing labor from each other to use older men , and handicapped people , and more women , and even grown boys and girls , wherever possible and reasonable , to replace men of military age and fitness to train new personnel for essential war work and to stop the wastage of labor in all non essential activities . There are many other things that we can do , and do immediately , to help meet the this manpower problem . The school authorities in all the states should work out plans to enable our high school students to take some time from their school year , and to use their summer vacations , to help farmers raise and harvest their crops , or to work somewhere in the war industries . This does not mean closing schools and stopping education . It does mean giving older students a better opportunity to contribute their bit to the war effort . Such work will do no harm to the students . People should do their work as near their homes as possible . We cannot afford to transport a single worker into an area where there is already a worker available to do the job . In some communities , employers dislike to employ women . In others they are reluctant to hire Negroes . In still others , older men are not wanted . We can no longer afford to indulge such prejudices or practices . Every citizen wants to know what essential war work he can do the best . He can get the answer by applying to the nearest United States Employment Service office . There are four thousand five hundred of these offices throughout the Nation . They are form the corner grocery stores of our manpower system . This network of employment offices is prepared to advise every citizen where his skills and labors are needed most , and to refer him to an employer who can utilize them to best advantage in the war effort . Perhaps the most difficult phase of the manpower problem is the scarcity of farm labor in many places . I have seen evidences of the fact , however , that the people are trying to meet it as well as possible . In one community that I visited a perishable crop was harvested by turning out the whole of the high school for three or four days . And in another community of fruit growers the usual Japanese labor was not available but when the fruit ripened , the banker , the butcher , the lawyer , the garage man , the druggist , the local editor , and in fact every able bodied man and woman in the town , left their occupations , and went out gathering ed the fruit , and sent it to market . Every farmer in the land must realize fully that his production is part of war production , and that he is regarded by the Nation as essential to victory . The American people expect him to keep his production up , and even to increase it . We will use every effort to help him to get labor but , at the same time , he and the people of his community must use ingenuity and cooperative effort to produce crops , and livestock and dairy products . It may be that all of our volunteer effort however well intentioned and well administered will not suffice wholly to solve the this problem . In that case , we shall have to adopt new legislation . And if this is necessary , I do not believe that the American people will shrink from it . In a sense , every American , because of the privilege of his citizenship , is a part of the Selective Service . The Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the Selective Service Boards . The successful operation of the Selective Service System and the way it has been accepted by the great mass of our citizens give us confidence that if necessary , the same principle could be used to solve any manpower problem . And I want to say also a word of praise and thanks for to the more than ten million people , all over the country , who have volunteered for the work of civilian defense and who are working hard at it . They are displaying unselfish devotion in the patient performance of their often tiresome and always anonymous tasks . In doing this important neighborly work they are helping to fortify our national unity and our real understanding of the fact that we are all involved in this war . Naturally , on my trip I was most interested in watching the training of our fighting forces . All of our combat units that go overseas must consist of young , strong men who have had thorough training . An Army division that has an average age of twenty three or twenty four is a better fighting unit than one which has an average age of thirty three or thirty four . The more of such troops we have in the field , the sooner the war will be won , and the smaller will be the cost in casualties . Therefore , I believe that it will be necessary to lower the present minimum age limit for Selective Service from twenty years down to eighteen . We have learned how inevitable that is and how important to the speeding up of victory . I can very thoroughly understand the feelings of all parents whose sons have entered our armed forces . I have an appreciation of that feeling and so has my wife . I want every father and every mother who has a son in the service to know again , from what I have seen with my own eyes that the men in the Army , Navy and Marine Corps are receiving today the best possible training , equipment and medical care . And we will never fail to provide for the spiritual needs of our officers and men under the Chaplains of our armed services . Good training will save many , many lives in battle . The highest rate of casualties is always suffered by units comprised of inadequately trained men . We can be sure that the combat units of our Army and Navy are well manned , and well equipped , and well trained . Their effectiveness in action will depend upon the quality of their leadership , and upon the wisdom of the strategic plans on which all military operations are based . I can say one thing about our these plans of ours They are not being decided by the typewriter strategists who expound their views in the press or on the radio . One of the greatest of American soldiers , Robert Lee , once remarked on the tragic fact that in the war of his day all of the best generals were apparently working on newspapers instead of in the Army . And that seems to be true in all wars . The trouble with the typewriter strategists is that while they may be full of bright ideas , they are not in possession of much information about the facts or problems of military operations . We , therefore , will continue to leave the plans for this war to the military leaders . The military and naval plans of the United States are made by the Joint Staff of the Army and Navy which is constantly in session in Washington . The Chiefs of this Staff are Admiral Leahy , General Marshall , Admiral King and General Arnold . They meet and confer regularly with representatives of the British Joint Staff , and with representatives of Russia , China , the Netherlands , Poland , Norway , the British Dominions and other nations working in the common cause . Since this unity of operations was put into effect last January , there has been a very substantial agreement between these planners , all of whom are trained in the profession of arms air , sea and land from their early years . As Commander in Chief I have at all times also been in substantial agreement . As I have said before , many major decisions of strategy have been made . One of them on which we have all agreed relates to the necessity of diverting enemy forces from Russia and China to other theaters of war by new offensives against Germany and Japan . An announcement of how these offensives are to be launched , and when , and where , cannot be broadcast over the radio at this time . We are celebrat e ing today the exploit of a bold and adventurous Italian Christopher Columbus who with the aid of Spain opened up a new world where freedom and tolerance and respect for human rights and dignity provided an asylum for the oppressed of the old world . Today , the sons of the New World are fighting in lands far distant from their own America . They are fighting to save for all mankind , including ourselves , the principles which have flourished in this new world of freedom . We are mindful of the countless millions of people whose future liberty and whose very lives depend upon permanent victory for the United Nations . There are a few people in this country who , when the collapse of the Axis begins , will tell our people that we are safe once more that we can tell the rest of the world to stew in its own juice that never again will we help to pull the other fellow s chestnuts from the fire that the future of civilization can jolly well take care of itself insofar as we are concerned . But it is useless to win battles if the cause for which we fight these battles is lost . It is useless to win a war unless it stays won . We , therefore , fight for the restoration and perpetuation of faith and hope and peace throughout the world . The objective of today is clear and realistic . It is to destroy completely the military power of Germany , Italy and Japan to such good purpose that their threat against us and all the other United Nations cannot be revived a generation hence . We are united in seeking the kind of victory that will guarantee that our grandchildren can grow and , under Gods may live their lives , free from the constant threat of invasion , destruction , slavery and violent death .<speech_sep>My Friends I have recently just returned from extensive journeying in the region of the Mediterranean and as far as the borders of Russia . I have conferred with the leaders of Britain and Russia and China on military matters of the present especially on plans for stepping up our successful attack on our enemies as quickly as possible and from many different points of the compass . On this Christmas Eve there are over ten million men in the armed forces of the United States alone . One year ago 1 , 700 , 000 were serving overseas . Today , this figure has been more than doubled to 3 , 800 , 000 on duty overseas . By next July first that number overseas will rise to over 5 , 000 , 000 men and women . That this is truly a World War was demonstrated to me when arrangements were being made with our overseas broadcasting agencies for the time to speak today to our soldiers , and sailors , and marines and merchant seamen in every part of the world . In fixing the time for this the broadcast , we took into consideration that at this moment here in the United States , and in the Caribbean and on the Northeast Coast of South America , it is afternoon . In Alaska and in Hawaii and the mid Pacific , it is still morning . In Iceland , in Great Britain , in North Africa , in Italy and the Middle East , it is now evening . In the Southwest Pacific , in Australia , in China and Burma and India , it is already Christmas Day . So we can correctly say that at this moment , in those far eastern parts where Americans are fighting , today is tomorrow . But everywhere throughout the world through out this war that which covers the world there is a special spirit that which has warmed our hearts since our earliest childhood a spirit that which brings us close to our homes , our families , our friends and neighbors the Christmas spirit of peace on earth , goodwill toward men . It is an unquenchable spirit . During the past years of international gangsterism and brutal aggression in Europe and in Asia , our Christmas celebrations have been darkened with apprehension for the future . We have said , Merry Christmas a Happy New Year , but we have known in our hearts that the clouds which have hung over our world have prevented us from saying it with full sincerity and conviction . And But even this year , we still have much to face in the way of further suffering , and sacrifice , and personal tragedy . Our men , who have been through the fierce battles in the Solomons , and the Gilberts , and Tunisia and Italy know , from their own experience and knowledge of modern war , that many bigger and costlier battles are still to be fought . But on Christmas Eve this year I can say to you that at last we may look forward into the future with real , substantial confidence that , however great the cost , peace on earth , good will toward men can be and will be realized and ensured . This year I can say that . Last year I could not do more than express a hope . Today I express a certainty though the cost may be high and the time may be long . Within the past year within the past few weeks history has been made , and it is far better history for the whole human race than any that we have known , or even dared to hope for , in these tragic times through which we pass . A great beginning was made in the Moscow conference last in October by Molotov , Eden and our own Hull . There and then the way was paved for the later meetings . At Cairo and Teheran we devoted ourselves not only to military matters , we devoted ourselves also to consideration of the future to plans for the kind of world which alone can justify all the sacrifices of this war . Of course , as you all know , Churchill and I have happily met many times before , and we know and understand each other very well . Indeed , Churchill has become known and beloved by many millions of Americans , and the heartfelt prayers of all of us have been with this great citizen of the world in his recent serious illness . The Cairo and Teheran conferences , however , gave me my first opportunity to meet the Generalissimo , Chiang Kai shek , and Marshal Stalin and to sit down at the table with these unconquerable men and talk with them face to face . We had planned to talk to each other across the table at Cairo and Teheran but we soon found that we were all on the same side of the table . We came to the conferences with faith in each other . But we needed the personal contact . And now we have supplemented faith with definite knowledge . It was well worth traveling thousands of miles over land and sea to bring about this personal meeting , and to gain the heartening assurance that we are absolutely agreed with one another on all the major objectives and on the military means of obtaining them . At Cairo , Prime Minister Churchill and I spent four days with the Generalissimo , Chiang Kai shek . It was the first time that we had had an opportunity to go over the complex situation in the Far East with him personally . We were able not only to settle upon definite military strategy , but also to discuss certain long range principles which we believe can assure peace in the Far East for many generations to come . Those principles are as simple as they are fundamental . They involve the restoration of stolen property to its rightful owners , and the recognition of the rights of millions of people in the Far East to build up their own forms of self government without molestation . Essential to all peace and security in the Pacific and in the rest of the world is the permanent elimination of the Empire of Japan as a potential force of aggression . Never again must our soldiers and sailors and marines and other soldiers , sailors and marines be compelled to fight from island to island as they are fighting so gallantly and so successfully today . Increasingly powerful forces are now hammering at the Japanese at many points over an enormous arc which curves down through the Pacific from the Aleutians to the Jungles of Burma . Our own Army and Navy , our Air Forces , the Australians and New Zealanders , the Dutch , and the British land , air and sea forces are all forming a band of steel which is slowly but surely closing in on Japan . And On the mainland of Asia , under the Generalissimo s leadership , the Chinese ground and air forces augmented by American air forces are playing a vital part in starting the drive which will push the invaders into the sea . Following out the military decisions at Cairo , General Marshall has just flown around the world and has had conferences with General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz conferences which will spell plenty of bad news for the Japs in the not too far distant future . I met in the Generalissimo a man of great vision , and great courage , and a remarkably keen understanding of the problems of today and tomorrow . We discussed all the manifold military plans for striking at Japan with decisive force from many directions , and I believe I can say that he returned to Chungking with the positive assurance of total victory over our common enemy . Today we and the Republic of China are closer together than ever before in deep friendship and in unity of purpose . After the Cairo conference , Churchill and I went by airplane to Teheran . There we met with Marshal Stalin . We talked with complete frankness on every conceivable subject connected with the winning of the war and the establishment of a durable peace after the war . Within three days of intense and consistently amicable discussions , we agreed on every point concerned with the launching of a gigantic attack upon Germany . The Russian army will continue its stern offensives on Germany s Eastern front , the allied armies in Italy and Africa will bring relentless pressure on Germany from the south , and now the encirclement will be complete as great American and British forces attack from other points of the compass . The Commander selected to lead the combined attack from these other points is General Dwight Eisenhower . His performances in Africa , in Sicily and in Italy have been brilliant . He knows by practical and successful experience the way to coordinate air , sea and land power . All of these will be under his control . Lieutenant General Carl D . Spaatz will command the entire American strategic bombing force operating against Germany . General Eisenhower gives up his command in the Mediterranean to a British officer whose name is being announced by Churchill . We now pledge that new Commander that our powerful ground , sea and air forces in the vital Mediterranean area will stand by his side until every objective in that bitter theatre is attained . Both of these new Commanders will have American and British subordinate Commanders whose names will be announced to the world in a few days . During the last two days in at Teheran , Marshal Stalin , Churchill and I looked ahead ahead to the days and months and years that which will follow Germany s defeat . We were united in determination that Germany must be stripped of her military might and be given no opportunity within the foreseeable future to regain that might . The United Nations have no intention to enslave the German people . We wish them to have a normal chance to develop , in peace , as useful and respectable members of the European family . But we most certainly emphasize that word respectable for we intend to rid them once and for all of Nazism and Prussian militarism and the fantastic and disastrous notion that they constitute the Master Race . We did discuss international relationships from the point of view of big , broad objectives , rather than details . But on the basis of what we did discuss , I can say even today that I do not think any insoluble differences will arise among Russia , Great Britain and the United States . In these conferences we were concerned with basic principles principles which involve the security and the welfare and the standard of living or human beings in countries large and small . To use an American and somewhat ungrammatical colloquialism , I may say that I got along fine with Marshal Stalin . He is a man who combines a tremendous , relentless determination with a stalwart good humor . I believe he is truly representative of the heart and soul of Russia and I believe that we are going to get along very well with him and the Russian people very well indeed . Britain , Russia , China and the United States and their Allies represent more than three quarters of the total population of the earth . As long as these four nations with great military power stick together in determination to keep the peace there will be no possibility of an aggressor nation arising to start another world war . But those four powers must be united with and cooperate with all the freedom loving peoples of Europe , and Asia , and Africa and the Americas . The rights of every nation , large or small , must be respected and guarded as jealously as are the rights of every individual within our own republic . The doctrine that the strong shall dominate the weak is the doctrine of our enemies and we reject it . But , at the same time , we are agreed that if force is necessary to keep international peace , international force will be applied for as long as it may be necessary . It has been our steady policy and it is certainly a common sense policy that the right of each nation to freedom must be measured by the willingness of that nation to fight for freedom . And today we salute our unseen Allies in occupied countries the underground resistance groups and the armies of liberation . They will provide potent forces against our enemies , when the day of the counter invasion comes . Through the development of science the world has become so much smaller that we have had to discard the geographical yardsticks of the past . For instance , through our early history the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were believed to be walls of safety for the United States . Time and distance made it physically possible , for example , for us and for the other American Republics to obtain and maintain our independence against infinitely stronger powers . Until recently very few people , even military experts , thought that the day would ever come when we might have to defend our Pacific Coast against Japanese threats of invasion . At the outbreak of the first World War relatively few people thought that our ships and shipping would be menaced by German submarines on the high seas or that the German militarists would ever attempt to dominate any nation outside of central Europe . After the Armistice in 1918 , we thought and hoped that the militaristic philosophy of Germany had been crushed and being full of the milk of human kindness we spent the next twenty fifteen years disarming , while the Germans whined so pathetically that the other nations permitted them and even helped them to rearm . For too many years we lived on pious hopes that aggressor and warlike nations would learn and understand and carry out the doctrine of purely voluntary peace . The well intentioned but ill fated experiments of former years did not work . It is my hope that we will not try them again . No that is putting it too weakly it is my intention to do all that I humanly can as President and Commander in Chief to see to it that these tragic mistakes shall not be made again . There have always been cheerful idiots in this country who believed that there would be no more war for us , if everybody in America would only return into their homes and lock their front doors behind them . Assuming that their motives were of the highest , events have shown how unwilling they were to face the facts . The overwhelming majority of all the people in the world want peace . Most of them are fighting for the attainment of peace not just a truce , not just an armistice but peace that is as strongly enforced and as durable as mortal man can make it . If we are willing to fight for peace now , is it not good logic that we should use force if necessary , in the future , to keep the peace I believe , and I think I can say , that the other three great nations who are fighting so magnificently to gain peace are in complete agreement that we must be prepared to keep the peace by force . If the people of Germany and Japan are made to realize thoroughly that the world is not going to let them break out again , it is possible , and , I hope , probable , that they will abandon the philosophy of aggression the belief that they can gain the whole world even at the risk of losing their own souls . I shall have more to say about the Cairo and Teheran conferences when I make my report to the Congress in about two weeks time . And , on that occasion , I shall also have a great deal to say about certain conditions here at home . But today I wish to say that in all my travels , at home and abroad , it is the sight of our soldiers and sailors and their magnificent achievements which have given me the greatest inspiration and the greatest encouragement for the future . To the members of our armed forces , to their wives , mothers and fathers , I want to affirm the great faith and confidence that we have in General Marshall and in Admiral King who direct all of our armed might throughout the world . Upon them falls the great responsibility of planning the strategy of determining when and where and when we shall fight . Both of these men have already gained high places in American history , places which will record in that history many evidences of their military genius that cannot be published today . Some of our men overseas are now spending their third Christmas far from home . To them and to all others overseas or soon to go overseas , I can give assurance that it is the purpose of their Government to win this war and to bring them home at the earliest possible time date . And We here in the United States had better be sure that when our soldiers and sailors do come home they will find an America in which they are given full opportunities for education , and rehabilitation , social security , and employment and business enterprise under the free American system and that they will find a Government which , by their votes as American citizens , they have had a full share in electing . The American people have had every reason to know that this is a tough and destructive war . On my trip abroad , I talked with many military men who had faced our enemies in the field . These hard headed realists testify to the strength and skill and resourcefulness of the enemy generals and men whom we must beat before final victory is won . The war is now reaching the stage where we shall all have to look forward to large casualty lists dead , wounded and missing . War entails just that . There is no easy road to victory . And the end is not yet in sight . I have been back only for a week . It is fair that I should tell you my impression . I think I see a tendency in some of our people here to assume a quick ending of the war that we have already gained the victory . And , perhaps as a result of this false reasoning , I think I discern an effort to resume or even encourage an outbreak of partisan thinking and talking . I hope I am wrong . For , surely , our first and most foremost tasks are all concerned with winning the war and winning a just peace that will last for generations . The massive offensives which are in the making both in Europe and the Far East will require every ounce of energy and fortitude that we and our Allies can summon on the fighting fronts and in all the workshops at home . As I have said before , you cannot order up a great attack on a Monday and demand that it be delivered on Saturday . Less than a month ago I flew in a big Army transport plane over the little town of Bethlehem , in Palestine . Tonight , on Christmas Eve , all men and women everywhere who love Christmas are thinking of that ancient town and of the star of faith that shone there more than nineteen centuries ago . American boys are fighting today in snow covered mountains , in malarial jungles , and on blazing deserts , they are fighting on the far stretches of the sea and above the clouds , and fighting for the thing for which they struggle . , I think it is best symbolized by the message that came out of Bethlehem . On behalf of the American people your own people I send this Christmas message to you , to you who are in our armed forces In our hearts are prayers for you and for all your comrades in arms who fight to rid the world of evil . We ask God s blessing upon you upon your fathers , and mothers , and wives and children all your loved ones at home . We ask that the comfort of God s grace shall be granted to those who are sick and wounded , and to those who are prisoners of war in the hands of the enemy , waiting for the day when they will again be free . And we ask that God receive and cherish those who have given their lives , and that He keep them in honor and in the grateful memory of their countrymen forever . God bless all of you who fight our battles on this Christmas Eve . God bless us all . God Keep us strong in our faith that we fight for a better day for human kind here and everywhere .<speech_sep>This afternoon I have issued a Proclamation calling a special session of the Congress to convene on Monday , November 15 , 1937 . I do this in order to give to the Congress an opportunity to consider important legislation before the regular session in January and to enable the Congress to avoid a lengthy session next year , extending through the summer . I know that many enemies of democracy will say that it is bad for business , bad for the tranquility of the country , to have a special session even one beginning only six weeks before the regular session . But I have never had sympathy with the point of view that a session of the Congress is an unfortunate intrusion of what they call politics into our national affairs . Those who do not like democracy want to keep legislators at home . But the Congress is an essential instrument of democratic government , and democratic government can never be considered an intruder into the affairs of a democratic nation . I shall ask this special session to consider immediately certain important legislation , which my recent trip through the nation convinces me the American people immediately need . This does not mean that other legislation , to which I am not referring tonight , is not an important for part of our national well being . But other legislation can be more readily discussed at the regular session . Anyone charged with proposing or judging national policies should have first hand knowledge of the nation as a whole . That is why again this year I have taken trips to all parts of the country . Last spring I visited the Southwest . This summer I made several trips in the East . Now I am just back from a trip from a trip all the way across the continent , and later this autumn I hope to pay my annual visit to the Southeast . For a President especially it is a duty to think in national terms . He must think not only of this year but of future years , when someone else will be President . He must look beyond the average of the prosperity and well being of the country for because averages easily cover up danger spots of poverty and instability . He must not let the country be deceived by a merely temporary prosperity , which depends on wasteful exploitation of resources , which cannot last . He must think not only of keeping us out of war today , but also of keeping us out of war in generations to come . The kind of prosperity we want is the sound and permanent kind which is not built up temporarily at the expense of any a section or any group . And the kind of peace we want is the sound and permanent kind , which is built on the cooperative search for peace by all the nations which want peace . The other day I was asked to state my outstanding impression gained on this recent trip to the Pacific Coast and back , and I said that it seemed to me to be the general understanding on the part of the average citizen , understanding of the broad objectives and policies which I have just outlined . Five years of fierce discussion and debate five years of information through the radio and the moving picture have taken the whole nation to school in the nation s business . Even those who have most attacked our objectives have , by their very criticism , encouraged the mass of our citizens to think about and understand the issues involved , and , understanding , to approve . Out of that process , we have learned to think as a nation . And out of that process we have learned to feel ourselves a nation . As never before in our history , each section of America says to every other section , Thy people shall be my people . For most of the country this has been a good year better in dollars and cents than for many years far better in the soundness of its prosperity . And Everywhere I went I found particular optimism about the good effect on business which is expected from the steady spending by farmers of the largest farm income in many years . But we have not yet done all that must be done to make this prosperity stable . The people of the United States were checked in their efforts to prevent future piling up of huge agricultural surpluses and the tumbling prices , which inevitably follow them . They were checked in their efforts to secure reasonable minimum wages and maximum hours and the end of child labor . And because they were checked , many groups in many parts of the country still have less purchasing power and a lower standard of living than the nation as a whole can permanently allow . Americans realize these facts . That is why they ask Government not to stop overning simply because prosperity has come back a long way . They do not look on Government as an interloper in their affairs . On the contrary , they regard it as the most effective form of organized self help . Sometimes I get bored sitting in Washington hearing certain people talk and talk about all that Government ought not to do people who got all they wanted from Government back in the days when the financial institutions and the railroads were being bailed out in 1933 , bailed out by the Government . It is refreshing to go out through the country and feel the common wisdom that the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining . They want the financial budget balanced . But they want the human budget balanced as well . They want to set up a national economy which balances itself with as little Government subsidy as possible , for they realize that persistent subsidies ultimately bankrupt their Government . They are less concerned that every detail be immediately right than they are that the direction be right . They know that just so long as we are traveling on the right road , it does not make much difference if occasionally we hit a Thank you marm . The overwhelming majority of our citizens who live by agriculture are thinking very clearly how they want Government to help them in connection with the production of crops . They want Government help in two ways first , in the control of surpluses , and , second , in the proper use of land . The other day a reporter told me that he had never been able to understand why the Government seeks to curtail crop production and , at the same time , to open up new irrigated acres . He was confusing two totally separate objectives . Crop surplus control relates to the total amount of any major crop grown in the whole nation on all cultivated land , good or bad good land or poor land control by the cooperation of the crop growers and with the help of the Government . Land use on the other hand is a policy of providing each farmer with the best quality and type of land we have , or can make available , for his part in that total production . Adding good new land for diversified crops is offset by abandoning poor land now uneconomically farmed . The total amount of production largely determines the price of the crop , and , therefore , the difference between comfort and misery for the farmer . Let me give you an example If we Americans were foolish enough to run every shoe factory twenty four hours a day , seven days a week , we would soon have more shoes than the Nation could possibly buy a surplus of shoes so great that it would have to be destroyed , or given away , or sold at prices far below the cost of production . That simple law illustration , that simple law of supply and demand equally affects the price of all our major crops . You and I have heard big manufacturers talk about control of production by the farmer as an indefensible economy of scarcity , as they call it . And yet these same manufacturers never hesitate to shut down their own huge plants , throw men out of work , and cut down the purchasing power of the whole community communities whenever they think that they must adjust their production to an oversupply of the goods they make . When it is their baby who has the measles , they call it not an economy of scarcity but sound business judgment . Of course , speaking seriously , what you and I want is such governmental rules of the game that labor and agriculture and industry will all produce a balanced abundance without waste . So we intend this winter to find a way to prevent four and a half cent cotton and nine cent corn and thirty cent wheat with all the disaster those prices mean for all of us to prevent those prices from ever coming back again . To do that , the farmers themselves want to cooperate to build an all weather farm program so that in the long run prices will be more stable . They believe this can be done , and the national budget kept out of the red . And when we have found that way to protect the farmers prices from the effects of alternating crop surpluses and crop scarcities , we shall also have found the way to protect the nation s food supply from the effects of the same fluctuation . We ought always to have enough food at prices within the reach of the consuming public . For the consumers in the cities of America , we must find a way to help the farmers to store up in years of plenty enough to avoid hardship in the years of scarcity . Our land use policy is a different thing . I have just visited much of the work that the National Government is doing to stop soil erosion , to save our forests , to prevent floods , to produce electric power for more general use , and to give people a chance to move from poor land on to better land by irrigating thousands of acres that need only water to provide an opportunity to make a good living . I saw bare and burned hillsides where only a few years ago great forests were growing . They are now being planted to young trees , not only to stop erosion , but to provide a lumber supply for the future . I saw CCC boys and WPA workers building check dams and small ponds and terraces to raise the water table and make it possible for farms and villages to remain in safety where they now are . I saw the harnessing of the turbulent Missouri , a muddy stream , with the topsoil of many states . And I saw barges on new channels carrying produce and freight athwart the Nation . Let me give you two simple illustrations of why Government projects of this type have a national importance for the whole country , and not merely a local importance . In the Boise Valley in Idaho I saw a district which had been recently irrigated to enormous fertility so that a family can now make a pretty good living from forty acres of its land . Many of the families , who are making good in that valley today , moved there from a thousand miles away . They came from the dust strip that runs through the middle of the Nation all the way from the Canadian border to Mexico Texas a strip which includes large portions of ten states . That valley in western Idaho , therefore , assumes at once a national importance as a second chance for willing farmers . And , year by year , we propose to add more valleys to take care of thousands of other families who need the same kind of second chance in new green pastures . The other illustration was at the Grand Coulee Dam in the State of Washington . The engineer in charge told me that almost half of the whole cost of that dam to date had been spent for materials that were manufactured east of the Mississippi River , giving employment and wages to thousands of industrial workers in the eastern third of the Nation , two thousand miles away . All of this work needs , of course , a more business like system of planning , and a greater foresight than we use today . And that is why I recommended to the last session of the Congress the creation of seven planning regions , in which local people will originate and coordinate recommendations as to the kind of this work of this kind to be done in their particular regions . The Congress will , of course , will determine the projects to be selected within the budget limits . To carry out any twentieth century program , we must give the Executive branch of the Government twentieth century machinery to work with . I recognize that democratic processes are necessarily and , I think , rightly slower than dictatorial processes . But I refuse to believe that democratic processes need be dangerously slow . For many years we have all known that the Executive and Administrative departments of the Government in Washington are a higgledy piggledy patchwork of duplicate responsibilities and overlapping powers . The reorganization of this vast Government machinery which I proposed to the Congress last winter does not conflict with the principle of the democratic process , as some people say . It only makes that process work more efficiently . On my recent trip many people have talked to me about the millions of men and women and children who still work at insufficient wages and overlong hours . American industry has searched the outside world to find new markets but it can create on its very doorstep the biggest and most permanent market it has ever had seen . It needs the reduction of trade barriers to improve its foreign markets , but it should not overlook the chance to reduce the domestic trade barrier right here right away without waiting for any treaty . A few more dollars a week in wages , a better distribution of jobs with a shorter working day will almost overnight make millions of our lowest paid workers actual buyers of billions of dollars of industrial and farm products . That increased volume of sales ought to lessen other cost of production so much that even a considerable increase in labor costs can be absorbed without imposing higher prices on the consumer . I am a firm believer in fully adequate pay for all labor . But right now I am most greatly concerned in increasing the pay of the lowest paid labor those who are our most numerous consuming group but who today do not make enough to maintain a decent standard of living or to buy the food , and the clothes and the other articles necessary to keep our factories and farms fully running . I think that farsighted businessmen already understand and agree with this policy . They agree also that no one section of the country can permanently benefit itself , or the rest of the country , by maintaining standards of wages and hours far that are far inferior to other sections of the country . Most businessmen , big and little , know that their Government neither wants to put them out of business nor to prevent them from earning a decent profit . In spite of the alarms of a few who seek to regain control of over American life , most businessmen , big and little , know that their Government is trying to make property more secure than ever before by giving every family a real chance to have a property stake in the Nation . Whatever danger there may be to the property and profits of the many , if there be any danger , comes not from Government s attitude toward business but from restraints now imposed upon business by private monopolies and financial oligarchies . The average businessman knows that a high cost of living is a great deterrent to business and that business prosperity depends much upon a low price policy which encourages the widest possible consumption . As one of the country s leading economists recently said The continuance of business recovery in the United States depends far more up on business policies , business pricing policies , than it does on anything that may be done , or not done , in Washington . Our competitive system is , of course , not altogether competitive . Anybody who buys any large quantity of manufactured goods knows this , whether it be the Government or an individual buyer . We have anti trust laws , to be sure , but they have not been adequate to check the growth of many monopolies . Whether or not they might have been adequate originally adequate , interpretation by the courts and the difficulties and delays of legal procedure have now definitely limited their effectiveness . We are already studying how to strengthen our anti trust laws in order to end monopoly not to hurt but to free legitimate business of the Nation . I have touched briefly on these important subjects , which , taken together , make a program for the immediate future . And I know you will realize that to attain it , legislation is necessary . As we plan today for the creation of ever higher standards of living for the people of the United States , we are aware that our plans may be most seriously affected by events in the world outside our borders . By a series of trade agreements , we have been attempting to recreate the trade of the world which that trade of the world that plays so important a part in our domestic prosperity but we know that if the world outside our borders falls into the chaos of war , world trade will be completely disrupted . Nor can we view with indifference the destruction of civilized values throughout the world . We seek peace , not only for our generation but also for the generation of our children . We seek for them , our children , the continuance of world civilization in order that their American civilization may continue to be invigorated , helped by the achievements of civilized men and women in all the rest of the world . I want our great democracy to be wise enough to realize that aloofness from war is not promoted by unawareness of war . In a world of mutual suspicions , peace must be affirmatively reached for . It cannot just be wished for . And it cannot just be waited for . We have now made known our willingness to attend a conference of the parties to the Nine Power Treaty of 1922 the Treaty of Washington , of which we are one of the original signatories . The purpose of this conference will be to seek by agreement a solution of the present situation in China . In efforts to find that solution , it is our purpose to cooperate with the other signatories to this Treaty , including China and Japan . Such cooperation would be an example of one of the possible paths to follow in our search for means toward peace throughout the whole world . The development of civilization and of human welfare is based on the acceptance by individuals of certain fundamental decencies in their relations with each other . And , equally , the development of peace in the world is dependent similarly on the acceptance by nations of certain fundamental decencies in their relations with each other . Ultimately , I hope each nation will accept the fact that violations of these rules of conduct are an injury to the well being of all nations . Meanwhile , remember that from 1913 to 1921 , I personally was fairly close to world events , and in that period , while I learned much of what to do , I also learned much of what not to do . The common sense , the intelligence of the people of America agree with my statement that America hates war . America hopes for peace . Therefore , America actively engages in the search for peace .<speech_sep>
