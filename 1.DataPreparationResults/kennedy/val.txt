Speaker of the Senate , Speaker of the House , Prime Minister , Members of the Canadian Houses of Parliament , distinguished guests and friends I am grateful for the generous remarks and kind sentiments toward my country and myself , Prime Minister . We in the United States have an impression that this country is made up of descendants of the English and the French . But I was glad to hear some applause coming from the very back benches when you mentioned Ireland . I am sure they are making progress forward . Je me sens vraiment entre amis . It is a deeply felt honor to address this distinguished legislative body . And yet may I say that I feel very much at home with you here today . For one third of my life was spent in the Parliament of my own country the United States Congress . There are some differences between this body and my own , the most noticeable to me is the lofty appearance of statesmanship which is on the faces of the Members of the Senators who realize that they will never have to place their cause before the people again I feel at home also here because I number in my own State of Massachusetts many friends and former constituents who are of Canadian descent . Among the voters of Massachusetts who were born outside the United States , the largest group by far was born in Canada . Their vote is enough to determine the outcome of an election , even a Presidential election . You can understand that having been elected President of the United States by less than 140 thousand votes out of 60 million , that I am very conscious of these statistics The warmth of your hospitality symbolizes more than merely the courtesy which may be accorded to an individual visitor . They symbolize the enduring qualities of amity and honor which have characterized our countries relations for so many decades . Nearly forty years ago , a distinguished Prime Minister of this country took the part of the United States at a disarmament conference . He said , They may not be angels but they are at least our friends . I must say that I do not think that we probably demonstrated in that forty years that we are angels yet , but I hope we have demonstrated that we are at least friends . And I must say that I think in these days where hazard is our constant companion , that friends are a very good thing to have . The Prime Minister was the first of the leaders from other lands who was invited to call upon me shortly after I entered the White House and this is my first trip the first trip of my wife and myself outside of our country s borders . It is just and fitting , and appropriate and traditional , that I should come here to Canada across a border that knows neither guns nor guerrillas . But we share more than a common border . We share a common heritage , traced back to those early settlers who traveled from the beachheads of the Maritime Provinces and New England to the far reaches of the Pacific Coast . Henry Thoreau spoke a common sentiment for them all Eastward I go only by force , Westward I go free . I must walk towards Oregon and not towards Europe . We share common values from the past , a common defense line at present , and common aspirations for the future our future , and indeed the future of all mankind . Geography has made us neighbors . History has made us friends . Economics has made us partners . And necessity has made us allies . Those whom nature hath so joined together , let no man put asunder . What unites us is far greater than what divides us . The issues and irritants that inevitably affect all neighbors are small deed in comparison with the issues that we face together above all the somber threat now posed to the whole neighborhood of this continent in fact , to the whole community of nations . But our alliance is born , not of fear , but of hope . It is an alliance that advances what we are for , as well as opposes what we are against . And so it is that when we speak of our common attitudes and relationships , Canada and the United States speak in 1961 in terms of unity . We do not seek the unanimity that comes to those who water down all issues to the lowest common denominator or to those who conceal their differences behind fixed smiles or to those who measure unity by standards of popularity and affection , instead of trust and respect . We are allies . This is a partnership , not an empire . We are bound to have differences and disappointments and we are equally bound to bring them out into the open , to settle them where they can be settled , and to respect each other s views when they cannot be settled . Thus ours is the unity of equal and independent nations , co tenants of the same continent , heirs of the same legacy , and fully sovereign associates in the same historic endeavor to preserve freedom for ourselves and all who wish it . To that endeavor we must bring great material and human resources , the result of separate cultures and independent economies . And above all , that endeavor requires a free and full exchange of new and different ideas on all issues and all undertakings . For it is clear that no free nation can stand alone to meet the threat of those who make themselves our adversaries that no free nation can retain any illusions about the nature of the threat and that no free nation can remain indifferent to the steady erosion of freedom around the globe . It is equally clear that no Western nation on its own can help those less developed lands to fulfill their hopes for steady progress . And finally , it is clear that in an age where new forces are asserting their strength around the globe when the political shape of the hemispheres are changing rapidly nothing is more vital than the unity of the United States and of Canada . And so my friends of Canada , whatever problems may exist or arise between us , I can assure you that my associates and I will be ever ready to discuss them with you , and to take whatever steps we can to remove them . And whatever those problems may be , I can also assure you that they shrink in comparison with the great and awesome tasks that await us as free and peace loving nations . So let us fix our attention , not on those matters that vex us as neighbors , but on the issues that face us as leaders . Let us look southward as part of the Hemisphere with whose fate we are both inextricably bound . Let us look eastward as part of the North Atlantic Community upon whose strength and will so many depend . Let us look westward to Japan , to the newly emerging lands of Asia and Africa and the Middle East , where lie the people upon whose fate and choice the struggle for freedom may ultimately depend . And let us look at the world in which we live and hope to go on living and at the way of life for which Canadians and I was reminded again of this this morning , on my visit to your War Memorial and Americans alike have always been willing to give up their lives in nearly every generation , if necessary to defend and preserve freedom . First , if you will , consider our mutual hopes for this Hemisphere . Stretching virtually from Pole to Pole , the nations of the Western Hemisphere are bound together by the laws of economics as well as geography , by a common dedication to freedom as well as a common history of fighting for it . To make this entire area more secure against aggression of all kinds to defend it against the encroachment of international communism in this Hemisphere and to see our sister states fulfill their hopes and needs for economic and social reform and development are surely all challenges confronting your nation , and deserving of your talents and resources , as well as ours . To be sure , it would mean an added responsibility but yours is not a nation that shrinks from responsibility . The Hemisphere is a family into which we were born and we cannot turn our backs on it in time of trouble . Nor can we stand aside from its great adventure of development . I believe that all of the free members of the Organization of American States would be heartened and strengthened by any increase in your Hemispheric role . Your skills , your resources , your judicious perception at the council table even when it differs from our own view are all needed throughout the inter American Community . Your country and mine are partners in North American affairs can we not now become partners in inter American affairs Secondly , let us consider our mutual hopes for the North Atlantic Community . Our NATO alliance is still , as it was when it was founded , the world s greatest bulwark of freedom . But the military balance of power has been changing . Enemy tactics and weaponry have been changing . We can stand still only at our peril . NATO force structures were originally devised to meet the threat of a massive conventional attack , in a period of Western nuclear monopoly . Now , if we are to meet the defense requirements of the 1960 s , the NATO countries must push forward simultaneously along two lines First , we must strengthen the conventional capability of our Alliance as a matter of the highest priority . To this end , we in the United States are taking steps to increase the strength and mobility of our forces and to modernize their equipment . To the same end , we will maintain our forces now on the European Continent and will increase their conventional capabilities . We look to our NATO Allies to assign an equally high priority to this same essential task . Second , we must make certain that nuclear weapons will continue to be available for the defense of the entire Treaty area , and that these weapons are at all times under close and flexible political control that meets the needs of all the NATO countries . We are prepared to join our Allies in working out suitable arrangements for this purpose . To make clear our own intentions and commitments to the defense of Western Europe , the United States will commit to the NATO command five and subsequently still more Polaris atomic missile submarines , which are defensive weapons , subject to any agreed NATO guidelines on their control and use , and responsive to the needs of all members but still credible in an emergency . Beyond this , we look to the possibility of eventually establishing a NATO sea borne force , which would be truly multi lateral in ownership and control , if this should be desired and found feasible by our Allies , once NATO s non nuclear goals have been achieved . Both of these measures improved conventional forces and increased nuclear forces are put forward in recognition of the fact that the defense of Europe and the assurances that can be given to the people of Europe and the defense of North America are indivisible in the hope that no aggressor will mistake our desire for peace with our determination to respond instantly to any attack with whatever force is appropriate and in the conviction that the time has come for all members of the NATO community to further increase and integrate their respective forces in the NATO command area , coordinating and sharing in research , development , production , storage , defense , command and training at all levels of armaments . So let us begin . Our opponents are watching to see if we in the West are divided . They take courage when we are . We must not let them be deceived or in doubt about our willingness to maintain our own freedom . Third , let us turn to the less developed nations in the southern half of the globe those who struggle to escape the bonds of mass misery which appeals to our hearts as well as to our hopes . Both your nation and mine have recognized our responsibilities to these new nations . Our people have given generously , if not always effectively . We could not do less . And now we must do more . For our historic task in this embattled age is not merely to defend freedom . It is to extend its writ and strengthen its covenant to peoples of different cultures and creeds and colors , whose policy or economic system may differ from ours , but whose desire to be free is no less fervent than our own . Through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Development Assistance Group , we can pool our vast resources and skills , and make available the kind of long term capital , planning and know how without which these nations will never achieve independent and viable economies , and without which our efforts will be tragically wasted . I propose further that the OECD establish a Development Center , where citizens and officials , and students and professional men of the Atlantic area and the less developed world can meet to study in common the problems of economic development . If we in the Atlantic Community can more closely coordinate our own economic policies and certainly the OECD provides the framework if we but use it , and I hope that you will join as we are seeking to join to use it then surely our potential economic resources are adequate to meet our responsibility . Consider , for example , the unsurpassed productivity of our farms . Less than 8 percent of the American working force is on our farms less than 11 percent of the Canadian working force is on yours . Fewer men on fewer acres than any nation on earth but free men on free acres can produce here in North America all the food that a hungry world could use while all the collective farms and forced labor of the communist system produce one shortage after another . This is a day to day miracle of our free societies , easy to forget at a time when our minds are caught up in the glamour of beginning the exploration of space . As the new nations emerge into independence , they face a choice Shall they develop by the method of consent , or by turning their freedom over to the system of totalitarian control . In making that decision they should look long and hard at the tragedy now being played out in the villages of Communist China . If we can work closely together to make our food surpluses a blessing instead of a curse , no man , woman or child need go hungry . And if each of the more fortunate nations can bear its fair share of the effort to help the less fortunate not merely those with whom we have traditional ties , but all who are willing and able to achieve meaningful growth and dignity then this decade will surely be a turning point in the history of the human family . Finally , let me say just a few words about the world in which we live . We should not misjudge the force of the challenge that we face a force that is powerful as well as insidious , that inspires dedication as well as fear , that uses means we cannot adopt to achieve ends we cannot permit . Nor can we mistake the nature of the struggle . It is not for concessions or territory . It is not simply between different systems . It is an age old battle for the survival of liberty itself . And our great advantage and we must never forget it is that the irresistible tide that began five hundred years before the birth of Christ in ancient Greece is for freedom , and against tyranny . And that is the wave of the future and the iron hand of totalitarianism can ultimately neither seize it nor turn it back . In the words of Macaulay A single breaker may recede , but the tide is coming in . So we in the Free World are not without hope . We are not without friends . And we are not without resources to defend ourselves and those who are associated with us . Believing in the peaceful settlement of disputes in the defense of human rights , we are working throughout the United Nations , and through regional and other associations , to lessen the risks , the tensions and the means and opportunity for aggression that have been mounting so rapidly throughout the world . In these councils of peace in the UN Emergency Force in the Middle East , in the Congo , in the International Control Commission in South East Asia , in the Ten Nations Commission on Disarmament Canada has played a leading , important , and constructive role . If we can contain the powerful struggle of ideologies , and reduce it to manageable proportions , we can proceed with the transcendent task of disciplining the nuclear weapons which shadow our lives , and of finding a widened range of common enterprises between ourselves and those who live under communist rule . For , in the end , we live on one planet and we are part of one human family and whatever the struggles that confront us , we must lose no chance to move forward towards a world of law and a world of disarmament . At the conference table and in the minds of men , the Free World s cause is strengthened because it is just . But it is strengthened even more by the dedicated efforts of free men and free nations . As the great parliamentarian Edmund Burke said , The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing . And that in essence is why I am here today . This trip is more than a consultation more than a good will visit . It is an act of faith faith in your country , in your leaders faith in the capacity of two great neighbors to meet their common problems and faith in the cause of freedom , in which we are so intimately associated .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , my copartners in Government , gentlemen and ladies The Constitution imposes upon me the obligation to from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union . While this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair , this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times . These are extraordinary times . And we face an extraordinary challenge . Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom s cause . No role in history could be more difficult or more important . We stand for freedom . That is our conviction for ourselves that is our only commitment to others . No friend , no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise . We are not against any man or any nation or any system except as it is hostile to freedom . Nor am I here to present a new military doctrine , bearing any one name or aimed at any one area . I am here to promote the freedom doctrine . The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe Asia , Latin America , Africa and the Middle East the lands of the rising peoples . Their revolution is the greatest in human history . They seek an end to injustice , tyranny , and exploitation . More than an end , they seek a beginning . And theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the Cold War , and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom . For the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution nor did they create the conditions which compel it . But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave to capture it for themselves . Yet their aggression is more often concealed than open . They have fired no missiles and their troops are seldom seen . They send arms , agitators , aid , technicians and propaganda to every troubled area . But where fighting is required , it is usually done by others by guerrillas striking at night , by assassins striking alone assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in Vietnam alone by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists , who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations . 1 1 At this point the following paragraph , which appears in fine text as signed and transmitted to the Senate and House of Representatives , was omitted in the reading of the message They possess a powerful intercontinental striking force , large forces for conventional war , a well trained underground in nearly every country , the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose , the capacity for quick decisions , a closed society without dissent or free information , and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion . They make the most of their scientific successes , their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution . They prey on unstable or unpopular governments , unsealed , or unknown boundaries , unfilled hopes , convulsive change , massive poverty , illiteracy , unrest and frustration . With these formidable weapons , the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory to exploit , to control , and finally to destroy the hopes of the world s newest nations and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade . It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory . And in that contest , we cannot stand aside . We stand , as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings , for the independence and equality of all nations . This nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom . And we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism . There is no single simple policy which meets this challenge . Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides that extending our commitments does not always increase our security that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike . Yet there is much we can do and must do . The proposals I bring before you are numerous and varied . They arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months . Taken together , I believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people . I am here to ask the help of this Congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures . IECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AT HOME The first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery . An affirmative anti recession program , initiated with your cooperation , supported the natural forces in the private sector and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy . The recession has been halted . Recovery is under way . But the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all . Large scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough , but large scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable . I am therefore transmitting to the Congress a new Manpower Development and Training program , to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers , particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four year period , in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand . It should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar , halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments . During the last two months , our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars , compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960 . We must maintain this progress and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone . As recovery progresses , there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases . These we cannot afford . They will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home . Labor and management must and I am confident that they will pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times . I look to the President s Advisory Committee on Labor Management Policy to give a strong lead in this direction . Moreover , if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions , it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards and I request the cooperation of the Congress in this regard to refrain from adding funds or programs , desirable as they may be , to the Budget to end the postal deficit , as my predecessor also recommended , through increased rates a deficit incidentally , this year , which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that I am submitting today to provide full pay as you go highway financing and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified . Our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay . IIECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS ABROAD I stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation . And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries . Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress . We would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone . For no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development . Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion . The most skillful counter guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism . But for those who share this view , we stand ready now , as we have in the past , to provide generously of our skills , and our capital , and our food to assist the peoples of the less developed nations to reach their goals in freedom to help them before they are engulfed in crisis . This is also our great opportunity in 1961 . If we grasp it , then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal . But if we do not pursue it , and if they do not pursue it , the bankruptcy of unstable governments , one by one , and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships . Earlier in the year , I outlined to the Congress a new program for aiding emerging nations and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program , to establish a new Act for International Development , and to add to the figures previously requested , in view of the swift pace of critical events , an additional 250 million dollars for a Presidential Contingency Fund , to be used only upon a Presidential determination in each case , with regular and complete reports to the Congress in each case , when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee as illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve . The total amount requested now raised to 2 . 65 billion dollars is both minimal and crucial . I do not see how anyone who is concerned as we all are about the growing threats to freedom around the globe and who is asking what more we can do as a people can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom . IAll that I have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind , or have alien ideals forced upon them . That struggle has highlighted the role of our Information Agency . It is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full , but increased by 2 million , 400 thousand dollars , to a total of 121 million dollars . This new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and Southeast Asia . These tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom . In Latin America , we are proposing to increase our Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week , compared to 42 hours today , none of which is in Portuguese , the language of about one third of the people of South America . The Soviets , Red Chinese and satellites already broadcast into Latin America more than 134 hours a week in Spanish and Portuguese . Communist China alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do . Moreover , powerful propaganda broadcasts from Havana now are heard throughout Latin America , encouraging new revolutions in several countries . Similarly , in Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia , and Thailand , we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend . Our interest is in the truth . OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR SELF DEFENSE But while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas , others talk of arms and threaten war . So we have learned to keep our defenses strong and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self defense . The events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts . The center of freedom s defense is our network of world alliances , extending from NATrecommended by a Democratic President and approved by a Republican Congress , to SEATrecommended by a Republican President and approved by a Democratic Congress . These alliances were constructed in the 1940 s and 1950 s it is our task and responsibility in the 1960 s to strengthen them . To meet the changing conditions of power and power relationships have changed we have endorsed an increased emphasis on NATO s conventional strength . At the same time we are affirming our conviction that the NATO nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong . I have made clear our intention to commit to the NATO command , for this purpose , the 5 Polaris submarines originally suggested by President Eisenhower , with the possibility , if needed , of more to come . Second , a major part of our partnership for self defense is the Military Assistance Program . The main burden of local defense against local attack , subversion , insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces . Where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats , our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful . Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking , our Military Assistance Program can be of help . But this program , like economic assistance , needs a new emphasis . It cannot be extended without regard to the social , political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability . The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies , not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader s desire for military display . And military assistance can , in addition to its military purposes , make a contribution to economic progress , as do our own Army Engineers . In an earlier message , I requested 1 . 6 billion dollars for Military Assistance , stating that this would maintain existing force levels , but that I could not foresee how much more might be required . It is now clear that this is not enough . The present crisis in Southeast Asia , on which the Vice President has made a valuable report the rising threat of communism in Latin America the increased arms traffic in Africa and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the Communist bloc in Asia and the Middle East all make clear the dimension of our needs . I therefore request the Congress to provide a total of 1 . 885 billion dollars for Military Assistance in the coming fiscal year an amount less than that requested a year ago but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence . This must be prudently and wisely spent and that will be our common endeavor . Military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time , and I recognize the strong pressures against it but this battle is far from over , it is reaching a crucial stage , and I believe we should participate in it . We cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure . VOUR OWN MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE In line with these developments , I have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non nuclear aggression . In the conventional field , with one exception , I find no present need for large new levies of men . What is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility . Therefore , I am directing the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the Army s divisional structure , to increase its non nuclear firepower , to improve its tactical mobility in any environment , to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat , to facilitate its coordination with our major allies , and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in Europe and bring their equipment up to date , and new airborne brigades in both the Pacific and Europe . And secondly , I am asking the Congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re equip this new Army structure with the most modern material . New helicopters , new armored personnel carriers , and new howitzers , for example , must be obtained now . Third , I am directing the Secretary of Defense to expand rapidly and substantially , in cooperation with our Allies , the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of nonnuclear war , para military operations and sub limited or unconventional wars . In addition , our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented . Throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations . Fourth , the Army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces . When these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened , two combat equipped divisions , plus their supporting forces , a total of 89 , 000 men , could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks notice 2 more divisions with but 5 weeks notice and six additional divisions and their supporting forces , making a total of 10 divisions , could be deployable with less than 8 weeks notice . In short , these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the Army in less than two months , compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required . Fifth , to enhance the already formidable ability of the Marine Corps to respond to limited war emergencies , I am asking the Congress for 60 million dollars to increase the Marine Corps strength to 190 , 000 men . This will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three Marine divisions and three air wings , and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion , if necessary for self defense . Finally , to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self defense in an age of hidden perils , our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed , and its coordination with other elements of policy assured . The Congress and the American people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization , policies , and control are necessary . VICIVIL DEFENSE One major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense . This problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated . In the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs , but we have never adopted a consistent policy . Public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy , indifference and skepticism while , at the same time , many of the civil defense plans have been so far reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support . This Administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do . It cannot be obtained cheaply . It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction . And it cannot deter a nuclear attack . We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response . If we have that strength , civil defense is not needed to deter an attack . If we should ever lack it , civil defense would not be an adequate substitute . But this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men . And the history of this planet , and particularly the history of the 20th century , is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack , a miscalculation , an accidental war , for a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which cannot be either foreseen or deterred . It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation . It is insurance we trust will never be needed but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe . Once the validity of this concept is recognized , there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation wide long range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures . Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large scale nuclear attack . Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds , but also sound organizational arrangements . Therefore , under the authority vested in me by Reorganization Plan No . 1 of 1958 , I am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense , the Secretary of Defense . It is important that this function remain civilian , in nature and leadership and this feature will not be changed . The Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions . To more accurately describe its role , its title should be changed to the Office of Emergency Planning . As soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests , such requests will be transmitted to the Congress for a much strengthened Federal State civil defense program . Such a program will provide Federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing structures , and it will include , where appropriate , incorporation of shelter in Federal buildings , new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with Federal assistance , and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in State and local and private buildings . Federal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests and they will increase sharply in subsequent years . Financial participation will also be required from State and local governments and from private citizens . But no insurance is cost free and every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort , time and money . For myself , I am convinced that it does . VIIDISARMAMENT I cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible . Our aims do not prepare for war they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war . That is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures . At Geneva , in cooperation with the United Kingdom , we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the Soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament . Up to now , their response has not been what we hoped , but Dean returned last night to Geneva , and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can . Meanwhile , we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race . To this end I shall send to the Congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged Disarmament Agency . ISPACE Finally , if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny , the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all , as did the Sputnik in 1957 , the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere , who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take . Since early in my term , our efforts in space have been under review . With the advice of the Vice President , who is Chairman of the National Space Council , we have examined where we are strong and where we are not , where we may succeed and where we may not . Now it is time to take longer strides time for a great new American enterprise time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement , which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth . I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary . But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership . We have never specified long range goals on an urgent time schedule , or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment . Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines , which gives them many months of lead time , and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes , we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own . For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first , we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last . We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world , but as shown by the feat of astronaut Shepard , this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful . But this is not merely a race . Space is open to us now and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others . We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake , free men must fully share . I therefore ask the Congress , above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities , to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals First , I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth . No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important for the long range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish . We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft . We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters , much larger than any now being developed , until certain which is superior . We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight . But in a very real sense , it will not be one man going to the moon if we make this judgment affirmatively , it will be an entire nation . For all of us must work to put him there . Secondly , an additional 23 million dollars , together with 7 million dollars already available , will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket . This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space , perhaps beyond the moon , perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself . Third , an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership , by accelerating the use of space satellites for world wide communications . Fourth , an additional 75 million dollars of which 53 million dollars is for the Weather Bureau will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world wide weather observation . Let it be clear and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs 531 million dollars in fiscal 62 an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years . If we are to go only half way , or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty , in my judgment it would be better not to go at all . Now this is a choice which this country must make , and I am confident that under the leadership of the Space Committees of the Congress , and the Appropriating Committees , that you will consider the matter carefully . It is a most important decision that we make as a nation . But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space , and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space . I believe we should go to the moon . But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment , to which we have given attention over many weeks and months , because it is a heavy burden , and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space , unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful . If we are not , we should decide today and this year . This decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower , materiel and facilities , and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread . It means a degree of dedication , organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts . It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages , inflated costs of material or talent , wasteful interagency rivalries , or a high turnover of key personnel . New objectives and new money cannot solve these problems . They could in fact , aggravate them further unless every scientist , every engineer , every serviceman , every technician , contractor , and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward , with the full speed of freedom , in the exciting adventure of space . CONCLUSION In conclusion , let me emphasize one point . It is not a pleasure for any President of the United States , as I am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors , to come before the Congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people . I came to this conclusion with some reluctance . But in my judgment , this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe , and it is the obligation , I believe , of the President of the United States to at least make his recommendations to the Members of the Congress , so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them . You must decide yourselves , as I have decided , and I am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that I have decided or not , that your judgment as my judgment is reached on what is in the best interests of our country . In conclusion , let me emphasize one point that we are determined , as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed and whatever the peril and set backs , we have some very large advantages . The first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty and since the beginning of history , and particularly since the end of the Second World War , liberty has been winning out all over the globe . A second great asset is that we are not alone . We have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom . May I cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally I am about to visit France . I look forward to my visit to France , and to my discussion with a great Captain of the Western World , President de Gaulle , as a meeting of particular significance , permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world wide peace and liberty . Such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road . A third asset is our desire for peace . It is sincere , and I believe the world knows it . We are proving it in our patience at the test ban table , and we are proving it in the UN where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization s usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations . In these and other instances , the response of our opponents has not been encouraging . Yet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible , though our credulity is limited that our hopes for peace are unfailing , while our determination to protect our security is resolute . For these reasons I have long thought it wise to meet with the Soviet Premier for a personal exchange of views . A meeting in Vienna turned out to be convenient for us both and the Austrian government has kindly made us welcome . No formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken but we will make dear America s enduring concern is for both peace and freedom that we are anxious to live in harmony with the Russian people that we seek no conquests , no satellites , no riches that we seek only the day when nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more . Finally , our greatest asset in this struggle is the American people their willingness to pay the price for these programs to understand and accept a long struggle to share their resources with other less fortunate people to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes I have requested to exercise self restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices , or over producing certain crops , or spreading military secrets , or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages to serve in the Peace Corps or the Armed Services or the Federal Civil Service or the Congress to strive for excellence in their schools , in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children to take part in Civil Defense to pay higher postal rates , and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers salaries , in order to strengthen our society to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders , with an image of America and I want that image , and I know you do , to be affirmative and positive and , finally , to practice democracy at home , in all States , with all races , to respect each other and to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens . I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience , or some hardship , or some sacrifice . But they have responded and you in the Congress have responded to your duty and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands . It is heartening to know , as I journey abroad , that our country is united in its commitment to freedom and is ready to do its duty .<speech_sep>Governor Stevenson , Senator Johnson , Butler , Senator Symington , Senator Humphrey , Speaker Rayburn , Fellow Democrats , I want to express my thanks to Governor Stevenson for his generous and heart warming introduction . It was my great honor to place his name in nomination at the 1956 Democratic National Convention , and I am delighted to have his support and his counsel and his advice in the coming months ahead . With a deep sense of duty and high resolve , I accept your nomination . I accept it with a full and grateful heart without reservation and with only one obligation the obligation to devote every effort of body , mind and spirit to lead our party back to victory and our Nation back to greatness . I am grateful too , that you have provided me with such an eloquent statement of our Party s platform . Pledges which are made so eloquently are made to be kept . The Rights of Man , the civil and economic rights essential to the human dignity of all men are indeed our goal and our first principles . This is a platform on which I can run with enthusiasm and conviction . And I am grateful , finally , that I can rely in the coming months on so many others on a distinguished running mate who brings unity to our ticket and strength to our Platform , Lyndon Johnson on one of the most articulate statesmen of our time , Adlai Stevenson on a great spokesman for our needs as a Nation and a people , Stuart Symington and on that fighting campaigner whose support I welcome , President Harry Truman on my traveling companion in Wisconsin and West Virginia , Senator Hubert Humphrey . On Paul Butler , our devoted and courageous Chairman . I feel a lot safer now that they are on my side again . And I am proud of the contrast with our Republican competitors . For their ranks are apparently so thin that not one challenger has come forth with both the competence and the courage to make theirs an open convention . I am fully aware of the fact that the Democratic Party , by nominating someone of my faith , has taken on what many regard as a new and hazardous risk new , at least since 1928 . But I look at it this way the Democratic Party has once again placed its confidence in the American people , and in their ability to render a free , fair judgement to uphold the Constitution and my oath of office and to reject any kind of religious pressure or obligation that might directly or indirectly interfere with my conduct of the Presidency in the national interest . My record of fourteen years supporting public education supporting complete separation of church and state and resisting pressure from any source on any issue should be clear by now to everyone . I hope that no American , considering the really critical issues facing this country , will waste his franchise by voting either for me or against me solely on account of my religious affiliation . It is not relevant . I want to stress , what some other political or religious leader may have said on this subject . It is not relevant what abuses may have existed in other countries or in other times . It is not relevant what pressures , if any , might conceivably be brought to bear on me . I am telling you now what you are entitled to know that my decisions on any public policy will be my own as an American , a Democrat and a free man . Under any circumstances , however , the victory that we seek in November will not be easy . We all know that in our hearts . We recognize the power of the forces that will be aligned against us . We know they will invoke the name of Abraham Lincoln on behalf of their candidate despite the fact that the political career of their candidate has often served to show charity toward none and malice toward for all . We know that it will not be easy to campaign against a man who has spoken or voted on every known side of every known issue . Nixon may feel it is his turn now , after the New Deal and the Fair Deal but before he deals , someone had better cut the cards . That someone may be the millions of Americans who voted for President Eisenhower but balk at his would be , self appointed successor . For just as historians tell us that Richard I was not fit to fill the shoes of bold Henry II and that Richard Cromwell was not fit to wear the mantle of his uncle they might add in future years that Richard Nixon did not measure to the footsteps of Dwight Eisenhower . Perhaps he could carry on the party policies the policies of Nixon , Benson , Dirksen and Goldwater . But this Nation cannot afford such a luxury . Perhaps we could better afford a Coolidge following Harding . And perhaps we could afford a Pierce following Fillmore . But after Buchanan , this nation needed a Lincoln after Taft , we needed a Wilson after Hoover we needed Franklin Roosevelt . . . . And after eight years of drugged and fitful sleep , this nation needs strong , creative Democratic leadership in the White House . But we are not merely running against Nixon . Our task is not merely one of itemizing Republican failures . Nor is that wholly necessary . For the families forced from the farm will know how to vote without our telling them . The unemployed miners and textile workers will know how to vote . The old people without medical care the families without a decent home the parents of children without adequate food or schools they all know that it is time for a change . But I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack . The times are too grave , the challenge too urgent , and the stakes too high to permit the customary passions of political debate . We are not here to curse the darkness , but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future . As Winston Churchill said on taking office some twenty years ago if we open a quarrel between the present and the past , we shall be in danger of losing the future . Today our concern must be with the future . For the world is changing . The old era is ending . The old ways will not do . Abroad , the balance of power is shifting . There are new and more terrible weapons new and uncertain nations new pressures of population and deprivation . One third of the world , it has been said , may be free but one third is the victim of cruel repression and the other one third is rocked by the pangs of poverty , hunger , and envy . More energy is released by the awakening of these new nations then by the fission of the atom itself . Meanwhile , Communist influence has penetrated further into Asia , stood astride in the Middle East and now festers some ninety miles off the coast of Florida . Friends have slipped into neutrality and neutrals into hostility . As our keynoter reminded us , the President who began his career by going to Korea ends it by staying away from Japan . The world has been close to war before but now man , who has survived all previous threats to his existence , has taken into his mortal hands the power to exterminate the entire species some seven times over . Here , at home , the changing face of the future is equally revolutionary . The New Deal and the Fair Deal were bold measures for their generations but this is a new generation . A technological revolution on the farm has led us to an output explosion but we have not yet learned how to harness that explosion usefully , while protecting our farmers right to full parity income . An urban population explosion has crowded our schools , cluttered up our suburbs , and increased the squalor of our slums . A peaceful revolution for human rights demanding an end to racial discrimination in all parts of our community life has strained at the leashes imposed by timid executive leadership . A medical revolution has extended the life of our elder citizens without providing the dignity and security those later years deserve . And a revolution of automation finds machines replacing men in the mines and mills of America , without replacing their incomes or their training or their needs to pay the family doctor , grocer and landlord . There has also been a change a slippage in our intellectual and moral strength . Seven lean years of drought and famine have withered a field of ideas . Blight has descended on our regulatory agencies and a dry rot , beginning in Washington , is seeping into every corner of America in the payola mentality , the expense account way of life , the confusion between what is legal and what is right . Too many Americans have lost their way , their will , and their sense of historic purpose . It is a time , in short , for a new generation of leadership new men to cope with new problems and new opportunities . All over the world , particularly in the newer nations , young men are coming to power men who are not bound by the traditions of the past men who are not blinded by the old fears and hates and rivalries young men who can cast off the old slogans and delusions and suspicions . The Republican nominee to be , of course , is also a young man . But his approach is as old as McKinley . His party is the party of the past . His speeches are generalities from Poor Richard s Almanac . Their platform , made up of left over Democratic planks , has the courage of our old convictions . Their pledge is a pledge to the status quo and today there can be no status quo . For I stand tonight facing west on what was once the last frontier . From the lands that stretch three thousand miles behind me , the pioneers of old gave up their safety , their comfort and sometimes their own lives to build a new world here in the West . They were not the captives of their own doubts , the prisoners of their own price tags . Their motto was not every man for himself but all for the common cause . They were determined to make that new world strong and free , to overcome its hazards and its hardships , to conquer the enemies that threatened from without and within . Today some would say that those struggles are all over that all the horizons have been explored that all the battles have been won that there is no longer an American frontier . But I trust that no one in this vast assemblage will agree with those sentiments . For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier the frontier of the 1960 s a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats . Woodrow Wilson s New Freedom promised our nation a new political and economic framework . Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal promised security and succor to those in need . But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises , it is a set of challenges . It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people , but what I intend to ask of them . It appeals to their pride , not to their pocketbook it holds out the promise of more sacrifice instead of more security . But I tell you the New Frontier is here , whether we seek it or not . Beyond that frontier are the uncharted areas of science and space , unsolved problems of peace and war , unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice , unanswered questions of poverty and surplus . It would be easier to shrink back from that frontier , to look to the safe mediocrity of the past , to be lulled by good intentions and high rhetoric and those who prefer that course should not cast their votes for me regardless of party . But I believe the times demand new invention , innovation , imagination , decision . I am asking each of you to be pioneers on that New Frontier . My call is to the young in heart , regardless of age to all who respond to the Scriptural call Be strong and of good courage be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed . For courage not complacency is our need today leadership , not salesmanship . And the only valid test of leadership is the ability to lead , and lead vigorously . A tired nation , said David Lloyd George , is a Tory nation , and the United States today cannot afford to be either tired or Tory . There may be those who wish to hear more more promises to this group or that more harsh rhetoric about the men in the Kremlin more assurances of a golden future , where taxes are always low and subsidies ever high . But my promises are in the platform you have adopted . Our ends will not be won by rhetoric and we can have faith in the future only if we have faith in ourselves . For the harsh facts of the matter are that we stand on this frontier at a turning point in history . We must prove all over again whether this nation , or any nation so conceived , can long endure whether our society , with its freedom of choice , its breadth of opportunity , its range of alternatives , can compete with the single minded advance of the Communist system . Can a nation organized and governed such as ours endure That is the real question . Have we the nerve and the will Can we carry through in an age where we will witness not only new breakthroughs in weapons of destruction , but also a race for mastery of the sky and the rain , the ocean and the tides , the far side of space and the inside of men s minds Are we up to the task are we equal to the challenge Are we willing to match the Russian sacrifice of the present for the future , or must we sacrifice our future in order to enjoy the present That is the question of the New Frontier . That is the choice our nation must make a choice that lies not merely between two men or two parties , but between the public interest and private comfort between national greatness and national decline between the fresh air of progress and the stale , dank atmosphere of normalcy between determined dedication and creeping mediocrity . All mankind waits upon our decision . A whole world looks to see what we will do . We cannot fail their trust , we cannot fail to try . It has been a long road from that first snowy day in New Hampshire to this crowded convention city . Now begins another long journey , taking me into your cities and homes all over America . Give me your help , your hand , your voice , your vote . Recall with me the words of Isaiah They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary . As we face the coming challenge , we too shall wait upon the Lord , and ask that he renew our strength , Then shall we be equal to the test . Then shall we not be weary . And then we shall prevail . Thank you .<speech_sep>Smith , Nixon . In the election of 1860 , Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half slave or half free . In the election of 1960 , and with the world around us , the question is whether the world will exist half slave or half free , whether it will move in the direction of freedom , in the direction of the road that we are taking , or whether it will move in the direction of slavery . I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States , on the kind of society that we build , on the kind of strength that we maintain . We discuss tonight domestic issues , but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Khrushchev for survival . Khrushchev is in New York , and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself . The Chinese Communists have always had a large population . But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country . The kind of country we have here , the kind of society we have , the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom . If we do well here , if we meet our obligations , if we are moving ahead , then I think freedom will be secure around the world . If we fail , then freedom fails . Therefore , I think the question before the American people is Are we doing as much as we can do Are we as strong as we should be Are we as strong as we must be if we are going to maintain our independence , and if we are going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance , to those who look to us for survival I should make it very clear that I do not think we are doing enough , that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we are making . This is a great country , but I think it could be a greater country and this is a powerful country , but I think it could be a more powerful country . I am not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel mill capacity unused . I am not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world . Because economic growth means strength and vitality it means we are able to sustain our defenses it means we are able to meet our commitments abroad . I am not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food some of it rotting even though there is a hungry world , and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government , which averages five cents a day per individual . I saw cases in West Virginia , here in the United States , where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I do not think we are meeting our obligations toward these Americans . I am not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are . I am not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid , or when our children go to school part time shifts . I think we should have an educational system second to none . I am not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa in charge of the largest union in the United States still free . I am not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest . Here in the United States , which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are . These are all the things , I think , in this country that can make our society strong , or can mean that it stands still . I am not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights . If a Negro baby is born and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities he has about one half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby . He has one third as much chance to get through college as a white student . He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man , about half as much chance to own a house . He has about uh four times as much chance that he will be out of work in his life as the white baby . I think we can do better . I do not want the talents of any American to go to waste . I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government . I do not at all . I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities . And I want the states to meet their responsibilities . But I think there is also a national responsibility . The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty five years . The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley collectively they could have . A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota , he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so . Seventeen million Americans , who live over sixty five on an average Social Security check of about seventy eight dollars a month , they are not able to sustain themselves individually , but they can sustain themselves through the social security system . I do not believe in big government , but I believe in effective governmental action . And I think that is the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom . It is the only way that we are going to move ahead . I think we can do a better job . I think we are going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us . We cannot turn the job over to anyone else . If the United States fails , then the whole cause of freedom fails . And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country . The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States . Because they felt that the American society was moving again . I want us to recapture that image . I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America to see how we are doing things to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing and not to look at Khrushchev , or look at the Chinese Communists . That is the obligation upon our generation . In 1933 , Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny . I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous . The question now is Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack attack it has ever known I think it can be . And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here . I think it is time America started moving again . Well , the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946 we both served in the Labor Committee . I have been there now for fourteen years , the same period of time that he has , so that our experience in uh government is comparable . Secondly , I think the question is uh what are the programs that we advocate , what is the party record that we lead I come out of the Democratic party , which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , and which supported and sustained these programs which I have discussed tonight . Nixon comes out of the Republican party . He was nominated by it . And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education , medical care for the aged , development of the Tennessee Valley , development of our natural resources . I think Nixon is an effective leader of his party . I hope he would grant me the same . The question before us is which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States Well , I would say in the latter that the and that is what I found uh somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh Nixon , that you used in your previous speech , when you talked about the Truman Administration . You Truman came to office in nineteen uh forty four and at the end of the war , and uh difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition 1946 when price controls were lifted so it is rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years . I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth . In regard to uh price stability uh I am not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices . In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions , I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had . I think it is true of Latin America also . We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year , so that I do not think that uh we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor . That is correct . Well , because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh then I think you would have complete uh economic chaos . The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall . There are hundreds of thousands of them . They really do not they are not able to control their market very well . They bring their crops in or their livestock in , many of them about the same time . They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs a few large companies in many cases and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place . I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture . And if the agricultural economy collapses , then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse . The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States . The automobile industry is the number one market for steel . So if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years , then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country . So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one . Secondly , my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance . The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work , and we now have the highest uh surpluses nine billion dollars worth . We have had a uh higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years . I think that this farm policy has failed . In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance . And that can only be done through governmental action . I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported , that the federal government , after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity , attempt to bring supply and demand into balance attempt effective production controls so that we will not have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent . I think Benson s program has failed . And I must say , after reading the Vice President s speech before the farmers , as he read mine , I do not believe that it is very much different from Benson s . I do not think it provides effective governmental controls . I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years , which was Benson s theory . I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future . Well , I will just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh what our judgment is of the future , and what our goals are for the United States , and what ability we have to implement those goals . Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty eight and was a distinguished president . There is no certain road to the presidency . There are no guarantees that uh if you take uh one road or another that you will be a successful president . I have been in the Congress for fourteen years . I have voted in the last uh eight years uh and the Vice President was uh presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities . I have met met uh decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States , but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . The question really is which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties No , never . No . No . Not reducing the interest reducing the interest rate . In my judgment , the hard money , tight money policy , fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow down in our economy , which helped bring the recession of fifty four which made the recession of fifty eight rather intense , and which has slowed , somewhat , our economic activity in 1960 . What I have talked about , however , the kind of programs that I have talked about , in my judgment , are uh fiscally sound . Medical care for the aged , I would put under social security . The Vice President and I disagree on this . The program the Javits Nixon or the Nixon Javits program would have cost , if fully used uh six hundred million dollars by the government per year , and six hundred million dollars by the state . The program which I advocated , which failed by five votes in the United States Senate , would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security , and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax . Secondly , I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers salaries . I think that is a good investment . I think we are going to have to do it . And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax , which is already strained in many of our communities , will provide , will make sh insure , in my opinion , that many of our children will not be adequately educated , and many of our teachers not adequately compensated . There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none . On the question of the development of natural resources , I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects , in the same way as the Tennessee Valley . I believe in the balanced budget . And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession . Otherwise , with a steady rate of economic growth and Nixon and Rockefeller , in their meeting , said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues . Whatever is brought in , I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget , if business remains orderly . When uh the Vice President quotes me in January , sixty , I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers salaries , but that was not the issue before the Senate in February . The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state . The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries . On that question the Vice President and I disagreed . I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly , because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th Nixon and I disagreed , and his tie vote uh defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal . I do not want the federal government paying teachers salaries directly . But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers salaries , in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee . And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass . Secondly , there have been statements made that uh the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget . That is wholly wrong , wholly in error , and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars . That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record . My view is that you can do these programs and they should be carefully drawn within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead . Well as you take the bills If I may take the bills , we did pass in the Senate a bill uh to provide a dollar twenty five cent minimum wage . It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes . And I might say that two thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it nearly two thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty five . We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter it is extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it . All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one third plus one in either the House or the Senate . Secondly , we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate . It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives . It was killed in the Rules Committee . And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House . Four Democrats voted for it . Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives . Thirdly , on medical care for the aged , this is the same fight that is been going on for twenty five years in Social Security . We wanted to tie it to Social Security . We offered an amendment to do so . Forty four Democrats voted for it , one Republican voted for it . And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it . In my judgment , a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs . But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress , in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session , which is a clash of parties and inaction . Well , now let us look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme . One was a bill for a dollar twenty five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business . I do not think that is extreme at all and yet nearly two thirds to three fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal . Secondly was the federal aid to education bill . It it was a very uh because of the defeat of teacher salaries , it was not a bill that uh met in my opinion the need . The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended , Nixon , this morning in your proposal . It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join , at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House not one Republican and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it . I do not say the Democrats are united in their support of the program . But I do say a majority are . And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it . The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security , which is financed out of Social Security funds . It does not put a deficit on the Treasury . The proposal advanced by you and by Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars Rockefeller rejected it in New York , said he did not agree with the financing at all , said it ought to be on Social Security . So these are three programs which are quite moderate . I think it shows the difference between the two parties . One party is ready to move in these programs . The other party gives them lip service . Well , I think they are serious . I think it is a matter that we should continue to uh give uh great care and attention to . We should support uh the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh those who would destroy us from within . We should sustain uh the Department of Justice in its efforts and the B . I . , and we should be continually alert . I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States , I think that we can meet any internal threat . The major threat is external and will continue . Well , I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure in my opinion , almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools . Secondly , I think we have a rich uh country . And I think we have a powerful country . I think what we have to do , however , is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade , if we are going to maintain our security in education , in economic growth , in development of natural resources . The Soviet Union is making great gains . It is not enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago , or ten years ago , or fifteen years ago , or twenty years ago . I want to compare what we are doing with what our adversaries are doing , so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education , in health , in building , in homes , in economic strength . I think that is the big assignment , the big task , the big function of the federal government . The point was made by Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty four percent of ours . I must say that forty four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight . I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship . I do not want to see the day when it is sixty percent of ours , and seventy and seventy five and eighty and ninety percent of ours , with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction . Secondly , the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged . Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill . The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security . I think it is a very clear contrast . In 1935 , when the Social Security Act was written , ninety four out of ninety five Republicans voted against it . Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it . In August of 1960 , when we tried to get it again , but this time for medical care , we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion . Thirdly , I think the question before the American people is as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them , the goals are the same for all Americans . The means are at question . The means are at issue . If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory , that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists that we have b gaining more security , that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve , that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength , then I agree . I think you should vote for Nixon . But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties , that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties , the agenda for our people what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom . As I said at the beginning , the question before us all , that faces all Republicans and all Democrats , is can freedom in the next generation conquer , or are the Communists going to be successful That is the great issue . And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer . If we fail , if we fail to move ahead , if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country , then I think that uh the tide could begin to run against us . And I do not want historians , ten years from now , to say , these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States . I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in these were the years when the United States started to move again . That is the question before the American people , and only you can decide what you want , what you want this country to be , what you want to do with the future . I think we are ready to move . And it is to that great task , if we are successful , that we will address ourselves .<speech_sep>General Gavan , Gleason , members of the military forces , veterans , fellow Americans Today we are here to celebrate and to honor and to commemorate the dead and the living , the young men who in every war since this country began have given testimony to their loyalty to their country and their own great courage . I do not believe that any nation in the history of the world has buried its soldiers farther from its native soil than we Americans or buried them closer to the towns in which they grew up . We celebrate this Veterans Day for a very few minutes , a few seconds of silence and then this country s life goes on . But I think it most appropriate that we recall on this occasion , and on every other moment when we are faced with great responsibilities , the contribution and the sacrifice which so many men and their families have made in order to permit this country to now occupy its present position of responsibility and freedom , and in order to permit us to gather here together . Bruce Catton , after totaling the casualties which took place in the battle of Antietam , not so very far from this cemetery , when he looked at statistics which showed that in the short space of a few minutes whole regiments lost 50 to 75 percent of their numbers , then wrote that life perhaps is not the most precious gift of all , that men died for the possession of a few feet of a corn field or a rocky hill , or for almost nothing at all . But in a very larger sense , they died that this country might be permitted to go on , and that it might permit to be fulfilled the great hopes of its founders . In a world tormented by tension and the possibilities of conflict , we meet in a quiet commemoration of an historic day of peace . In an age that threatens the survival of freedom , we join together to honor those who made our freedom possible . The resolution of the Congress which first proclaimed Armistice Day , described November 11 , 1918 , as the end of the most destructive , sanguinary and far reaching war in the history of human annals . That resolution expressed the hope that the First World War would be , in truth , the war to end all wars . It suggested that those men who had died had therefore not given their lives in vain . It is a tragic fact that these hopes have not been fulfilled , that wars still more destructive and still more sanguinary followed , that man s capacity to devise new ways of killing his fellow men have far outstripped his capacity to live in peace with his fellow men . Some might say , therefore , that this day has lost its meaning , that the shadow of the new and deadly weapons have robbed this day of its great value , that whatever name we now give this day , whatever flags we fly or prayers we utter , it is too late to honor those who died before , and too soon to promise the living an end to organized death . But let us not forget that November 11 , 1918 , signified a beginning , as well as an end . The purpose of all war , said Augustine , is peace . The First World War produced man s first great effort in recent times to solve by international cooperation the problems of war . That experiment continues in our present day still imperfect , still short of its responsibilities , but it does offer a hope that some day nations can live in harmony . For our part , we shall achieve that peace only with patience and perseverance and courage the patience and perseverance necessary to work with allies of diverse interests but common goals , the courage necessary over a long period of time to overcome an adversary skilled in the arts of harassment and obstruction . There is no way to maintain the frontiers of freedom without cost and commitment and risk . There is no swift and easy path to peace in our generation . No man who witnessed the tragedies of the last war , no man who can imagine the unimaginable possibilities of the next war , can advocate war out of irritability or frustration or impatience . But let no nation confuse our perseverance and patience with fear of war or unwillingness to meet our responsibilities . We cannot save ourselves by abandoning those who are associated with us , or rejecting our responsibilities . In the end , the only way to maintain the peace is to be prepared in the final extreme to fight for our country and to mean it . As a nation , we have little capacity for deception . We can convince friend and foe alike that we are in earnest about the defense of freedom only if we are in earnest and I can assure the world that we are . This cemetery was first established 97 years ago . In this hill were first buried men who died in an earlier war , a savage war here in our own country . Ninety seven years ago today , the men in Gray were retiring from Antietam , where thousands of their comrades had fallen between dawn and dusk in one terrible day . And the men in Blue were moving towards Fredericksburg , where thousands would soon lie by a stone wall in heroic and sometimes miserable death . It was a crucial moment in our Nation s history , but these memories , sad and proud , these quiet grounds , this Cemetery and others like it all around the world , remind us with pride of our obligation and our opportunity . On this Veterans Day of 1961 , on this day of remembrance , let us pray in the name of those who have fought in this country s wars , and most especially who have fought in the First World War and in the Second World War , that there will be no veterans of any further war not because all shall have perished but because all shall have learned to live together in peace . And to the dead here in this cemetery we say They are the race they are the race immortal , Whose beams make broadthe common light of day Though Time may dim , though Death has barred their portal , These we salute , which nameless passed away .<speech_sep>Good evening Seven weeks ago tonight I returned from Europe to report on my meeting with Premier Khrushchev and the others . His grim warnings about the future of the world , his aide memoire on Berlin , his subsequent speeches and threats which he and his agents have launched , and the increase in the Soviet military budget that he has announced , have all prompted a series of decisions by the Administration and a series of consultations with the members of the NATO organization . In Berlin , as you recall , he intends to bring to an end , through a stroke of the pen , first our legal rights to be in West Berlin and secondly our ability to make good on our commitment to the two million free people of that city . That we cannot permit . We are clear about what must be done and we intend to do it . I want to talk frankly with you tonight about the first steps that we shall take . These actions will require sacrifice on the part of many of our citizens . More will be required in the future . They will require , from all of us , courage and perseverance in the years to come . But if we and our allies act out of strength and unity of purpose with calm determination and steady nerves using restraint in our words as well as our weapons . I am hopeful that both peace and freedom will be sustained . The immediate threat to free men is in West Berlin . But that isolated outpost is not an isolated problem . The threat is worldwide . Our effort must be equally wide and strong , and not be obsessed by any single manufactured crisis . We face a challenge in Berlin , but there is also a challenge in Southeast Asia , where the borders are less guarded , the enemy harder to find , and the dangers of communism less apparent to those who have so little . We face a challenge in our own hemisphere , and indeed wherever else the freedom of human beings is at stake . Let me remind you that the fortunes of war and diplomacy left the free people of West Berlin , in 1945 , 110 miles behind the Iron Curtain . This map makes very dear the problem that we face . The white is West Germany the East is the area controlled by the Soviet Union , and as you can see from the chart , West Berlin is 110 miles within the area which the Soviets now dominate which is immediately controlled by the so called East German regime . We are there as a result of our victory over Nazi Germany and our basic rights to be there , deriving from that victory , include both our presence in West Berlin and the enjoyment of access across East Germany . These rights have been repeatedly confirmed and recognized in special agreements with the Soviet Union . Berlin is not a part of East Germany , but a separate territory under the control of the allied powers . Thus our rights there are clear and deep rooted . But in addition to those rights is our commitment to sustain and defend , if need be the opportunity for more than two million people to determine their own future and choose their own way of life . Thus , our presence in West Berlin , and our access thereto , cannot be ended by any act of the Soviet government . The NATO shield was long ago extended to cover West Berlin and we have given our word that an attack upon that city will be regarded as an attack upon us all . For West Berlin lying exposed 110 miles inside East Germany , surrounded by Soviet troops and close to Soviet supply lines , has many roles . It is more than a showcase of liberty , a symbol , an island of freedom in a Communist sea . It is even more than a link with the Free World , a beacon of hope behind the Iron Curtain , an escape hatch for refugees . West Berlin is all of that . But above all it has now become as never before the great testing place of Western courage and will , a focal point where our solemn commitments stretching back over the years since 1945 , and Soviet ambitions now meet in basic confrontation . It would be a mistake for others to look upon Berlin , because of its location , as a tempting target . The United States is there the United Kingdom and France are there the pledge of NATO is there and the people of Berlin are there . It is as secure , in that sense , as the rest of us for we cannot separate its safety from our own . I hear it said that West Berlin is militarily untenable . And so was Bastogne . And so , in fact , was Stalingrad . Any dangerous spot is tenable if men brave men will make it so . We do not want to fight but we have fought before . And others in earlier times have made the same dangerous mistake of assuming that the West was too selfish and too soft and too divided to resist invasions of freedom in other lands . Those who threaten to unleash the forces of war on a dispute over West Berlin should recall the words of the ancient philosopher A man who causes fear cannot be free from fear . We cannot and will not permit the Communists to drive us out of Berlin , either gradually or by force . For the fulfillment of our pledge to that city is essential to the morale and security of Western Germany , to the unity of Western Europe , and to the faith of the entire Free World . Soviet strategy has long been aimed , not merely at Berlin , but at dividing and neutralizing all of Europe , forcing us back on our own shores . We must meet our oft stated pledge to the free peoples of West Berlin and maintain our rights and their safety , even in the face of force in order to maintain the confidence of other free peoples in our word and our resolve . The strength of the alliance on which our security depends is dependent in turn on our willingness to meet our commitments to them . So long as the Communists insist that they are preparing to end by themselves unilaterally our rights in West Berlin and our commitments to its people , we must be prepared to defend those rights and those commitments . We will at all times be ready to talk , if talk will help . But we must also be ready to resist with force , if force is used upon us . Either alone would fail . Together , they can serve the cause of freedom and peace . The new preparations that we shall make to defend the peace are part of the long term build up in our strength which has been underway since January . They are based on our needs to meet a world wide threat , on a basis which stretches far beyond the present Berlin crisis . Our primary purpose is neither propaganda nor provocation but preparation . A first need is to hasten progress toward the military goals which the North Atlantic allies have set for themselves . In Europe today nothing less will suffice . We will put even greater resources into fulfilling those goals , and we look to our allies to do the same . The supplementary defense build ups that I asked from the Congress in March and May have already started moving us toward these and our other defense goals . They included an increase in the size of the Marine Corps , improved readiness of our reserves , expansion of our air and sea lift , and stepped up procurement of needed weapons , ammunition , and other items . To insure a continuing invulnerable capacity to deter or destroy any aggressor , they provided for the strengthening of our missile power and for putting 50 of our B 52 and B 47 bombers on a ground alert which would send them on their way with 15 minutes warning . These measures must be speeded up , and still others must now be taken . We must have sea and air lift capable of moving our forces quickly and in large numbers to any part of the world . But even more importantly , we need the capability of placing in any critical area at the appropriate time a force which , combined with those of our allies , is large enough to make clear our determination and our ability to defend our rights at all costs and to meet all levels of aggressor pressure with whatever levels of force are required . We intend to have a wider choice than humiliation or all out nuclear action . While it is unwise at this time either to call up or send abroad excessive numbers of these troops before they are needed , let me make it clear that I intend to take , as time goes on , whatever steps are necessary to make certain that such forces can be deployed at the appropriate time without lessening our ability to meet our commitments elsewhere . Thus , in the days and months ahead , I shall not hesitate to ask the Congress for additional measures , or exercise any of the executive powers that I possess to meet this threat to peace . Everything essential to the security of freedom must be done and if that should require more men , or more taxes , or more controls , or other new powers , I shall not hesitate to ask them . The measures proposed today will be constantly studied , and altered as necessary . But while we will not let panic shape our policy , neither will we permit timidity to direct our program . Accordingly , I am now taking the following steps I am tomorrow requesting the Congress for the current fiscal year an additional 3 , 247 , 000 , 000 of appropriations for the Armed Forces . To fill out our present Army Divisions , and to make more men available for prompt deployment , I am requesting an increase in the Army s total authorized strength from 875 , 000 to approximately 1 million men . I am requesting an increase of 29 , 000 and 63 , 000 men respectively in the active duty strength of the Navy and the Air Force . To fulfill these manpower needs , I am ordering that our draft calls be doubled and tripled in the coming months I am asking the Congress for authority to order to active duty certain ready reserve units and individual reservists , and to extend tours of duty 2 and , under that authority , I am planning to order to active duty a number of air transport squadrons and Air National Guard tactical air squadrons , to give us the airlift capacity and protection that we need . Other reserve forces will be called up when needed . Many ships and planes once headed for retirement are to be retained or reactivated , increasing our airpower tactically and our sealift , airlift , and anti submarine warfare capability . In addition , our strategic air power will be increased by delaying the deactivation of B 47 bombers . Finally , some 1 . 8 billion about half of the total sum is needed for the procurement of non nuclear weapons , ammunition and equipment . The details on all these requests will be presented to the Congress tomorrow . Subsequent steps will be taken to suit subsequent needs . Comparable efforts for the common defense are being discussed with our NATO allies . For their commitment and interest are as precise as our own . And let me add that I am well aware of the fact that many American families will bear the burden of these requests . Studies or careers will be interrupted husbands and sons will be called away incomes in some cases will be reduced . But these are burdens which must be borne if freedom is to be defended Americans have willingly borne them before and they will not flinch from the task now . We have another sober responsibility . To recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age , without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go if bombs begin to fall , would be a failure of responsibility . In May , I pledged a new start on Civil Defense . Last week , I assigned , on the recommendation of the Civil Defense Director , basic responsibility for this program to the Secretary of Defense , to make certain it is administered and coordinated with our continental defense efforts at the highest civilian level . Tomorrow , I am requesting of the Congress new funds for the following immediate objectives to identify and mark space in existing structures public and private that could be used for fall out shelters in case of attack to stock those shelters with food , water , first aid kits and other minimum essentials for survival to increase their capacity to improve our air raid warning and fall out detection systems , including a new household warning system which is now under development and to take other measures that will be effective at an early date to save millions of lives if needed . In the event of an attack , the lives of those families which are not hit in a nuclear blast and fire can still be saved if they can be warned to take shelter and if that shelter is available . We owe that kind of insurance to our families and to our country . In contrast to our friends in Europe , the need for this kind of protection is new to our shores . But the time to start is now . In the coming months , I hope to let every citizen know what steps he can take without delay to protect his family in case of attack . I know that you will want to do no less . The addition of 207 million in Civil Defense appropriations brings our total new defense budget requests to 3 . 454 billion , and a total of 47 5 billion for the year . This is an increase in the defense budget of 6 billion since January , and has resulted in official estimates of a budget deficit of over 5 billion . The Secretary of the Treasury and other economic advisers assure me , however , that our economy has the capacity to bear this new request . We are recovering strongly from this year s recession . The increase in this last quarter of our year of our total national output was greater than that for any postwar period of initial recovery . And yet , wholesale prices are actually lower than they were during the recession , and consumer prices are only 1 4 of 1 higher than they were last October . In fact , this last quarter was the first in eight years in which our production has increased without an increase in the overall price index . And for the first time since the fall of 1959 , our gold position has improved and the dollar is more respected abroad . These gains , it should be stressed , are being accomplished with Budget deficits far smaller than those of the 1958 recession . This improved business outlook means improved revenues and I intend to submit to the Congress in January a budget for the next fiscal year which will be strictly in balance . Nevertheless , should an increase in taxes be needed because of events in the next few months to achieve that balance , or because of subsequent defense rises , those increased taxes will be requested in January . Meanwhile , to help make certain that the current deficit is held to a safe level , we must keep down all expenditures not thoroughly justified in budget requests . The luxury of our current post office deficit must be ended . Costs in military procurement will be closely scrutinized and in this effort I welcome the cooperation of the Congress . The tax loopholes I have specified on expense accounts , overseas income , dividends , interest , coo operatives and others must be closed . I realize that no public revenue measure is welcomed by everyone . But I am certain that every American wants to pay his fair share , and not leave the burden of defending freedom entirely to those who bear arms . For we have mortgaged our very future on this defense and we cannot fail to meet our responsibilities . But I must emphasize again that the choice is not merely between resistance and retreat , between atomic holocaust and surrender . Our peace time military posture is traditionally defensive but our diplomatic posture need not be . Our response to the Berlin crisis will not be merely military or negative . It will be more than merely standing firm . For we do not intend to leave it to others to choose and monopolize the forum and the framework of discussion . We do not intend to abandon our duty to mankind to seek a peaceful solution . As signers of the UN Charter , we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason . If they have proposals not demands we shall hear them . If they seek genuine understanding not concessions of our rights we shall meet with them . We have previously indicated our readiness to remove any actual irritants in West Berlin , but the freedom of that city is not negotiable . We cannot negotiate with those who say What is mine is mine and what is yours is negotiable . But we are willing to consider any arrangement or treaty in Germany consistent with the maintenance of peace and freedom , and with the legitimate security interests of all nations . We recognize the Soviet Union s historical concern about their security in Central and Eastern Europe , after a series of ravaging invasions , and we believe arrangements can be worked out which will help to meet those concerns , and make it possible for both security and freedom to exist in this troubled area . For it is not the freedom of West Berlin which is abnormal in Germany today , but the situation in that entire divided country . If anyone doubts the legality of our rights in Berlin , we are ready to have it submitted to international adjudication . If anyone doubts the extent to which our presence is desired by the people of West Berlin , compared to East German feelings about their regime , we are ready to have that question submitted to a free vote in Berlin and , if possible , among all the German people . And let us hear at that time from the two and one half million refugees who have fled the Communist regime in East Germany voting for Western type freedom with their feet . The world is not deceived by the Communist attempt to label Berlin as a hot bed of war . There is peace in Berlin today . The source of world trouble and tension is Moscow , not Berlin . And if war begins , it will have begun in Moscow and not Berlin . For the choice of peace or war is largely theirs , not ours . It is the Soviets who have stirred up this crisis . It is they who are trying to force a change . It is they who have opposed free elections . It is they who have rejected an all German peace treaty , and the rulings of international law . And as Americans know from our history on our own old frontier , gun battles are caused by outlaws , and not by officers of the peace . In short , while we are ready to defend our interests , we shall also be ready to search for peace in quiet exploratory talks in formal or informal meetings . We do not want military considerations to dominate the thinking of either East or West . And Khrushchev may find that his invitation to other nations to join in a meaningless treaty may lead to their inviting him to join in the community of peaceful men , in abandoning the use of force , and in respecting the sanctity of agreements . While all of these efforts go on , we must not be diverted from our total responsibilities , from other dangers , from other tasks . If new threats in Berlin or elsewhere should cause us to weaken our program of assistance to the developing nations who are also under heavy pressure from the same source , or to halt our efforts for realistic disarmament , or to disrupt or slow down our economy , or to neglect the education of our children , then those threats will surely be the most successful and least costly maneuver in Communist history . For we can afford all these efforts , and more but we cannot afford not to meet this challenge . And the challenge is not to us alone . It is a challenge to every nation which asserts its sovereignty under a system of liberty . It is a challenge to all those who want a world of free choice . It is a special challenge to the Atlantic Community the heartland of human freedom . We in the West must move together in building military strength . We must consult one another more closely than ever before . We must together design our proposals for peace , and labor together as they are pressed at the conference table . And together we must share the burdens and the risks of this effort . The Atlantic Community , as we know it , has been built in response to challenge the challenge of European chaos in 1947 , of the Berlin blockade in 1948 , the challenge of Communist aggression in Korea in 1950 . Now , standing strong and prosperous , after an unprecedented decade of progress , the Atlantic Community will not forget either its history or the principles which gave it meaning . The solemn vow each of us gave to West Berlin in time of peace will not be broken in time of danger . If we do not meet our commitments to Berlin , where will we later stand If we are not true to our word there , all that we have achieved in collective security , which relies on these words , will mean nothing . And if there is one path above all others to war , it is the path of weakness and disunity . Today , the endangered frontier of freedom runs through divided Berlin . We want it to remain a frontier of peace . This is the hope of every citizen of the Atlantic Community every citizen of Eastern Europe and , I am confident , every citizen of the Soviet Union . For I cannot believe that the Russian people who bravely suffered enormous losses in the Second World War would now wish to see the peace upset once more in Germany . The Soviet government alone can convert Berlin s frontier of peace into a pretext for war . The steps I have indicated tonight are aimed at avoiding that war . To sum it all up we seek peace but we shall not surrender . That is the central meaning of this crisis , and the meaning of your government s policy . With your help , and the help of other free men , this crisis can be surmounted . Freedom can prevail and peace can endure . I would like to close with a personal word . When I ran for the Presidency of the United States , I knew that this country faced serious challenges , but I could not realize nor could any man realize who does not bear the burdens of this office how heavy and constant would be those burdens . Three times in my life time our country and Europe have been involved in major wars . In each case serious misjudgments were made on both sides of the intentions of others , which brought about great devastation . Now , in the thermonuclear age , any misjudgment on either side about the intentions of the other could rain more devastation in several hours than has been wrought in all the wars of human history . Therefore as President and Commander in Chief , and all of us as Americans , are moving through serious days . I shall bear this responsibility under our Constitution for the next three and one half years , but I am sure that we all , regardless of our occupations , will do our very best for our country , and for our cause . For all of us want to see our children grow up in a country at peace , and in a world where freedom endures . I know that sometimes we get impatient , we wish for some immediate action that would end our perils . But I must tell you that there is no quick and easy solution . The Communists control over a billion people , and they recognize that if we should falter , their success would be imminent . We must look to long days ahead , which if we are courageous and persevering can bring us what we all desire . In these days and weeks I ask for your help , and your advice . I ask for your suggestions , when you think we could do better . All of us , I know , love our country , and we shall all do our best to serve it . In meeting my responsibilities in these coming months as President , I need your good will , and your support and above all , your prayers . Thank you , and good night .<speech_sep>General Westmoreland , General Lemnitzer , Secretary , General Decker , General Taylor , members of the graduating class and their parents , gentlemen I want to express my appreciation for your generous invitation to come to this graduating class . I am sure that all of you who sit here today realize , particularly in view of the song we have just heard , that you are part of a long tradition stretching back to the earliest days of this country s history , and that where you sit sat once some of the most celebrated names in our Nation s history , and also some who are not so well known , but who , on 100 different battlefields in many wars involving every generation of this country s history , have given very clear evidence of their commitment to their country . So that I know you feel a sense of pride in being part of that tradition , and as a citizen of the United States , as well as President , I want to express our high regard to all of you in appreciation for what you are doing and what you will do for our country in the days ahead . I would also like to announce at this time that as Commander in Chief I am exercising my privilege of directing the Secretary of the Army and the Superintendent of West Point to remit all existing confinements and other cadet punishments , and I hope that it will be possible to carry this out today . General Westmoreland was slightly pained to hear that this was impending in view of the fact that one cadet , who I am confident will some day be the head of the Army , has just been remitted for 8 months , and is about to be released . But I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in the advancement of his military career . My own confinement goes for another two and a half years , and I may ask for it to be extended instead of remitted . I want to say that I wish all of you , the graduates , success . While I say that , I am not unmindful of the fact that two graduates of this Academy have reached the White House , and neither was a member of my party . Until I am more certain that this trend will be broken , I wish that all of you may be generals and not Commanders in Chief . I want to say that I am sure you recognize that your schooling is only interrupted by today s occasion and not ended because the demands that will be made upon you in the service of your country in the coming months and years will be really more pressing , and in many ways more burdensome , as well as more challenging , than ever before in our history . I know that many of you may feel , and many of our citizens may feel that in these days of the nuclear age , when war may last in its final form a day or two or three days before much of the world is burned up , that your service to your country will be only standing and waiting . Nothing , of course , could be further from the truth . I am sure that many Americans believe that the days before World War II were the golden age when the stars were falling on all the graduates of West Point , that that was the golden time of service , and that you have moved into a period where military service , while vital , is not as challenging as it was then . Nothing could be further from the truth . The fact of the matter is that the period just ahead in the next decade will offer more opportunities for service to the graduates of this Academy than ever before in the history of the United States , because all around the world , in countries which are heavily engaged in the maintenance of their freedom , graduates of this Academy are heavily involved . Whether it is in Viet Nam or in Laos or in Thailand , whether it is a military advisory group in Iran , whether it is a military attach in some Latin American country during a difficult and challenging period , whether it is the commander of our troops in South Korea the burdens that will be placed upon you when you fill those positions as you must inevitably , will require more from you than ever before in our history . The graduates of West Point , the Naval Academy , and the Air Academy in the next 10 years will have the greatest opportunity for the defense of freedom that this Academy s graduates have ever had . And I am sure that the Joint Chiefs of Staff endorse that view , knowing as they do and I do , the heavy burdens that are required of this Academy s graduates every day General Tucker in Laos , or General Harkins in Viet Nam , and a dozen others who hold key and significant positions involving the security of the United States and the defense of freedom . You are going to follow in their footsteps and I must say that I think that you will be privileged in the years ahead to find yourselves so heavily involved in the great interests of this country . Therefore , I hope that you realize and I hope every American realizes how much we depend upon you . Your strictly military responsibilities , therefore , will require a versatility and an adaptability never before required in either war or in peace . They may involve the command and control of modern nuclear weapons and modern delivery systems , so complex that only a few scientists can understand their operation , so devastating that their inadvertent use would be of worldwide concern , but so new that their employment and their effects have never been tested in combat conditions . On the other hand , your responsibilities may involve the command of more traditional forces , but in less traditional roles . Men risking their lives , not as combatants , but as instructors or advisers , or as symbols of our Nation s commitments . The fact that the United States is not directly at war in these areas in no way diminishes the skill and the courage that will be required , the service to our country which is rendered , or the pain of the casualties which are suffered . To cite one final example of the range of responsibilities that will fall upon you you may hold a position of command with our special forces , forces which are too unconventional to be called conventional , forces which are growing in number and importance and significance , for we now know that it is wholly misleading to call this the nuclear age , or to say that our security rests only on the doctrine of massive retaliation . Korea has not been the only battleground since the end of the Second World War . Men have fought and died in Malaya , in Greece , in the Philippines , in Algeria and Cuba and Cyprus , and almost continuously on the Indo Chinese Peninsula . No nuclear weapons have been fired . No massive nuclear retaliation has been considered appropriate . This is another type of war , new in its intensity , ancient in its origin war by guerrillas , subversives , insurgents , assassins , war by ambush instead of by combat by infiltration , instead of aggression , seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him . It is a form of warfare uniquely adapted to what has been strangely called wars of liberation , to undermine the efforts of new and poor countries to maintain the freedom that they have finally achieved . It preys on economic unrest and ethnic conflicts . It requires in those situations where we must counter it , and these are the kinds of challenges that will be before us in the next decade if freedom is to be saved , a whole new kind of strategy , a wholly different kind of force , and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training . But I have spoken thus far only of the military challenges which your education must prepare you for . The nonmilitary problems which you will face will also be most demanding , diplomatic , political , and economic . In the years ahead , some of you will serve as advisers to foreign aid missions or even to foreign governments . Some will negotiate terms of a cease fire with broad political as well as military ramifications . Some of you will go to the far corners of the earth , and to the far reaches of space . Some of you will sit in the highest councils of the Pentagon . Others will hold delicate command posts which are international in character . Still others will advise on plans to abolish arms instead of using them to abolish others . Whatever your position , the scope of your decisions will not be confined to the traditional tenets of military competence and training . You will need to know and understand not only the foreign policy of the United States but the foreign policy of all countries scattered around the world who 20 years ago were the most distant names to us . You will need to give orders in different tongues and read maps by different systems . You will be involved in economic judgments which most economists would hesitate to make . At what point , for example , does military aid become burdensome to a country and make its freedom endangered rather than helping to secure it To what extent can the gold and dollar cost of our overseas deployments be offset by foreign procurement Or at what stage can a new weapons system be considered sufficiently advanced to justify large dollar appropriations In many countries , your posture and performance will provide the local population with the only evidence of what our country is really like . In other countries , your military mission , its advice and action , will play a key role in determining whether those people will remain free . You will need to understand the importance of military power and also the limits of military power , to decide what arms should be used to fight and when they should be used to prevent a fight , to determine what represents our vital interests and what interests are only marginal . Above all , you will have a responsibility to deter war as well as to fight it . For the basic problems facing the world today are not susceptible of a final military solution . While we will long require the services and admire the dedication and commitment of the fighting men of this country , neither our strategy nor our psychology as a nation , and certainly not our economy , must become permanently dependent upon an ever increasing military establishment . Our forces , therefore , must fulfill a broader role as a complement to our diplomacy , as an arm of our diplomacy , as a deterrent to our adversaries , and as a symbol to our allies of our determination to support them . That is why this Academy has seen its curriculum grow and expand in dimension , in substance , and in difficulty . That is why you cannot possibly have crowded into these 4 busy years all of the knowledge and all of the range of experience which you must bring to these subtle and delicate tasks which I have described . And that is why go to school year after year so you can serve this country to the best of your ability and your talent . To talk of such talent and effort raises in the minds , I am sure , of everyone , and the minds of all of our countrymen , why why should men such as you , able to master the complex arts of science , mathematics , language , economy , and all the rest devote their lives to a military career , with all of its risks and hardships Why should their families be expected to make the personal and financial sacrifices that a military career inevitably brings with it When there is a visible enemy to fight in open combat , the answer is not so difficult . Many serve , all applaud , and the tide of patriotism runs high . But when there is a long , slow struggle , with no immediate visible foe , your choice will seem hard indeed . And you will recall , I am sure , the lines found in an old sentry box in Gibraltar God and the soldier all men adoreIn time of trouble and no more , For when war is over , and all things righted , God is neglected and the old soldier slighted . But you have one satisfaction , however difficult those days may be when you are asked by a President of the United States or by any other American what you are doing for your country , no man s answer will be clearer than your own . And that moral motivation which brought you here in the first place is part of your training here as well . West Point was not built to produce technical experts alone . It was built to produce men committed to the defense of their country , leaders of men who understand the great stakes which are involved , leaders who can be entrusted with the heavy responsibility which modern weapons and the fight for freedom entail , leaders who can inspire in their men the same sense of obligation to duty which you bring to it . There is no single slogan that you can repeat to yourself in hard days or give to those who may be associated with you . In times past , a simple phrase , 54 40 or fight or to make the world safe for democracy that was enough . But the times , the weapons , and the issues are now more complicated than ever . Eighteen years ago today , Ernie Pyle , describing those tens of thousands of young men who crossed the ageless and indifferent sea of the English Channel , searched in vain for a word to describe what they were fighting for . And finally he concluded that they were at least fighting for each other . You and I leave here today to meet our separate responsibilities , to protect our Nation s vital interests by peaceful means if possible , by resolute action if necessary . And we go forth confident of support and success because we know that we are working and fighting for each other and for all those men and women all over the globe who are determined to be free .<speech_sep>Good evening , my fellow citizens I returned this morning from a week long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full . It was in every sense an unforgettable experience . The people of Paris , of Vienna , of London , were generous in their greeting . They were heartwarming in their hospitality , and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated . We knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented , which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom . Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception , to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe , to dine at Versailles , and Schonbrunn Palace , and with the Queen of England . These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come . Each of the three cities that we visited Paris , Vienna , and London have existed for many centuries , and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years , and has defended itself over many centuries . But this was not a ceremonial trip . Two aims of American foreign policy , above all others , were the reason for the trip the unity of the free world , whose strength is the security of us all , and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace . My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims . To strengthen the unity of the West , our journey opened in Paris and closed in London . My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me . Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom . Our alliance , I believe , became more secure the friendship of our nation , I hope with theirs became firmer and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer , and I hope were marked by confidence . I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position , whether or not it was his own , than in appearing to agree with him when we do not . But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance . He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility . His life has been one of unusual dedication he is a man of extraordinary personal character , symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France . Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large . I found him a wise counselor for the future , and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make . Thus we had a valuable meeting . I believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time I believe were removed on both sides . Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away . No question , however sensitive , was avoided . No area of interest was ignored , and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future in our agreement on defending Berlin , on working to improve the defenses of Europe , on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world , including Latin America , on spurring European economic unity , on concluding successfully the conference on Laos , and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance . General de Gaulle could not have been more cordial , and I could not have more confidence in any man . In addition to his individual strength of character , the French people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying . Their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic , their productivity is increasing , and they are steadily building their stature in both Europe and Africa , and thus , I left Paris for Vienna with increased confidence in Western unity and strength . The people of Vienna know what it is to live under occupation , and they know what it is to live in freedom . Their welcome to me as President of this country should be heartwarming to us all . I went to Vienna to meet the leader of the Soviet Union , Khrushchev . For 2 days we met in sober , intensive conversation , and I believe it is my obligation to the people , to the Congress , and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly . Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries . I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days . There was no discourtesy , no loss of tempers , no threats or ultimatums by either side no advantage or concession was either gained or given no major decision was either planned or taken no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended . This kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers , where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought , but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting , nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna . But I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev , as somber as it was , to be immensely useful . I had read his speeches and of his policies . I had been advised on his views . I had been told by other leaders of the West , General de Gaulle , Chancellor Adenauer , Prime Minister Macmillan , what manner of man he was . But I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States , and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me . It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible , that they are based on as much direct , firsthand knowledge as possible . I therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Khrushchev , that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies . At the same time , I wanted to make certain Khrushchev knew this country and its policies , that he understood our strength and our determination , and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind . I wanted to present our views to him directly , precisely , realistically , and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification . This was done . No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side . The gap between us was not , in such a short period , materially reduced , but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully , at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less , and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact . This is important , for neither of us tried to merely please the other , to agree merely to be agreeable , to say what the other wanted to hear . And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross examination , instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper , so , too , was this direct give and take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital , for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words war , peace , democracy , and popular will . We have wholly different views of right and wrong , of what is an internal affair and what is aggression , and , above all , we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going . Only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future . Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood . Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests . But both of us were there , I think , because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other , that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible , since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine , and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued . We believe in a system of national freedom and independence . He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism , and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends . However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests , I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort . That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful . The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation , nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear . It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty . The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos . Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation . Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos , much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia . Of critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva , both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease fire . It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva , enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty , to make certain that a cease fire is enforced and maintained . I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere . No such hope emerged , however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference , seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests . Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator in his opinion because no one was truly neutral that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage , in the absence of total disarmament and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile . In short , our hopes for an end to nuclear tests , for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons , and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow . Nevertheless , the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva . But our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin . I made it clear to Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin , that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance , and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk , and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin , and their right to choose their own future . Khrushchev , in turn , presented his views in detail , and his presentation will be the subject of further communications . But we are not seeking to change the present situation . A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany , and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin . Generally , Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war . He believes the world will move his way without resort to force . He spoke of his nation s achievements in space . He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production , to out trade us , to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours . Most of all , he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries . He was certain that the tide there was moving his way , that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution , and that the so called wars of liberation , supported by the Kremlin , would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion . In the 1940 s and early fifties , the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders , which we saw in Korea . Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas . Now we face a new and different threat . We no longer have a nuclear monopoly . Their missiles , they believe , will hold off our missiles , and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so called wars of liberation . Thus , the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion . A small group of disciplined Communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be 60 or 70 a year , and seize control , therefore , of an entire country without Communist troops ever crossing any international frontier . This is the Communist theory . But I believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong , that liberty and independence and self determination not communism is the future of man , and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom . But it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade . Khrushchev made one point which I wish to pass on . He said there are many disorders throughout the world , and he should not be blamed for them all . He is quite right . It is easy to dismiss as Communist inspired every anti government or anti American riot , every overthrow of a corrupt regime , or every mass protest against misery and despair . These are not all Communist inspired . The Communists move in to exploit them , to infiltrate their leadership , to ride their crest to victory . But the Communists did not create the conditions which caused them . In short , the hopes for freedom in these areas which see so much poverty and illiteracy , so many children who are sick , so many children who die in the first year , so many families without homes , so many families without hope the future for freedom in these areas rests with the local peoples and their governments . If they have the will to determine their own future , if their governments have the support of their own people , if their honest and progressive measures helping their people have inspired confidence and zeal , then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed . But where those conditions do not exist , a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offers little protection against internal decay . Yet all this does not mean that our Nation and the West and the free world can only sit by . On the contrary , we have an historic opportunity to help these countries build their societies until they are so strong and broadly based that only an outside invasion could topple them , and that threat , we know , can be stopped . We can train and equip their forces to resist Communist supplied insurrections . We can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standards can be built . We can encourage better administration and better education and better tax and land distribution and a better life for the people . All this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resources to do it , if we will only use and share them . I know that there is a great deal of feeling in the United States that we have carried the burden of economic assistance long enough , but these countries that we are now supporting stretching all the way along from the top of Europe through the Middle East , down through Saigon are now subject to great efforts internally , in many of them , to seize control . If we are not prepared to assist them in making a better life for their people , then I believe that the prospects for freedom in those areas are uncertain . We must , I believe , assist them if we are determined to meet with commitments of assistance our words against the Communist advance . The burden is heavy we have carried it for many years . But I believe that this fight is not over . This battle goes on , and we have to play our part in it . And therefore I hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free . It was fitting that Congress opened its hearings on our new foreign military and economic aid programs in Washington at the very time that Khrushchev s words in Vienna were demonstrating as nothing else could the need for that very program . It should be well run , effectively administered , but I believe we must do it , and I hope that you , the American people , will support it again , because I think it is vitally important to the security of these areas . There is no use talking against the Communist advance unless we are willing to meet our responsibilities , however burdensome they may be . I do not justify this aid merely on the grounds of anti Communism . It is a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free , and we are not alone . I found that the people of France , for example , were doing far more in Africa in the way of aiding independent nations than our own country was . But I know that foreign aid is a burden that is keenly felt and I can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now . My stay in England was short but the visit gave me a chance to confer privately again with Prime Minister Macmillan , just as others of our party in Vienna were conferring yesterday with General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer . We all agreed that there is work to be done in the West and from our conversations have come agreed steps to get on with that work . Our day in London , capped by a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip was a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the West remains united in its determination to hold to its standards . May I conclude by saying simply that I am glad to be home . We have on this trip admired splendid places and seen stirring sights , but we are glad to be home . No demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you , the American people , have so generously given to our country . With that support I am not fearful of the future . We must be patient . We must be determined . We must be courageous . We must accept both risks and burdens , but with the will and the work freedom will prevail . Good night , and thank you very much . Good evening , my fellow citizens I returned this morning from a week long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full .

Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries . I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days . There was no discourtesy , no loss of tempers , no threats or ultimatums by either side no advantage or concession was either gained or given no major decision was either planned or taken no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended . This kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers , where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought , but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting , nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna . But I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev , as somber as it was , to be immensely useful . I had read his speeches and of his policies . I had been advised on his views . I had been told by other leaders of the West , General de Gaulle , Chancellor Adenauer , Prime Minister Macmillan , what manner of man he was . But I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States , and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me . It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible , that they are based on as much direct , firsthand knowledge as possible . I therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Khrushchev , that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies . At the same time , I wanted to make certain Khrushchev knew this country and its policies , that he understood our strength and our determination , and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind . I wanted to present our views to him directly , precisely , realistically , and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification . This was done . No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side . The gap between us was not , in such a short period , materially reduced , but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully , at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less , and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact . This is important , for neither of us tried to merely please the other , to agree merely to be agreeable , to say what the other wanted to hear . And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross examination , instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper , so , too , was this direct give and take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital , for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words war , peace , democracy , and popular will . We have wholly different views of right and wrong , of what is an internal affair and what is aggression , and , above all , we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going . Only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future . Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood . Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests . But both of us were there , I think , because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other , that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible , since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine , and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued . We believe in a system of national freedom and independence . He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism , and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends . However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests , I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort . That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful . The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation , nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear . It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty . The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos . Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation . Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos , much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia . Of critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva , both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease fire . It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva , enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty , to make certain that a cease fire is enforced and maintained . I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere . No such hope emerged , however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference , seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests . Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator in his opinion because no one was truly neutral that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage , in the absence of total disarmament and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile . In short , our hopes for an end to nuclear tests , for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons , and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow . Nevertheless , the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva . But our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin . I made it clear to Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin , that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance , and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk , and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin , and their right to choose their own future . Khrushchev , in turn , presented his views in detail , and his presentation will be the subject of further communications . But we are not seeking to change the present situation . A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany , and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin . Generally , Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war . He believes the world will move his way without resort to force . He spoke of his nation s achievements in space . He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production , to out trade us , to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours . Most of all , he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries . He was certain that the tide there was moving his way , that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution , and that the so called wars of liberation , supported by the Kremlin , would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion . In the 1940 s and early fifties , the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders , which we saw in Korea . Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas . Now we face a new and different threat . We no longer have a nuclear monopoly . Their missiles , they believe , will hold off our missiles , and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so called wars of liberation . Thus , the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion . A small group of disciplined Communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be 60 or 70 a year , and seize control , therefore , of an entire country without Communist troops ever crossing any international frontier . This is the Communist theory . But I believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong , that liberty and independence and self determination not communism is the future of man , and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom . But it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade . Khrushchev made one point which I wish to pass on . He said there are many disorders throughout the world , and he should not be blamed for them all . He is quite right . It is easy to dismiss as Communist inspired every anti government or anti American riot , every overthrow of a corrupt regime , or every mass protest against misery and despair . These are not all Communist inspired . The Communists move in to exploit them , to infiltrate their leadership , to ride their crest to victory . But the Communists did not create the conditions which caused them . In short , the hopes for freedom in these areas which see so much poverty and illiteracy , so many children who are sick , so many children who die in the first year , so many families without homes , so many families without hope the future for freedom in these areas rests with the local peoples and their governments . If they have the will to determine their own future , if their governments have the support of their own people , if their honest and progressive measures helping their people have inspired confidence and zeal , then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed . But where those conditions do not exist , a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offers little protection against internal decay . Yet all this does not mean that our Nation and the West and the free world can only sit by . On the contrary , we have an historic opportunity to help these countries build their societies until they are so strong and broadly based that only an outside invasion could topple them , and that threat , we know , can be stopped . We can train and equip their forces to resist Communist supplied insurrections . We can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standards can be built . We can encourage better administration and better education and better tax and land distribution and a better life for the people . All this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resources to do it , if we will only use and share them . I know that there is a great deal of feeling in the United States that we have carried the burden of economic assistance long enough , but these countries that we are now supporting stretching all the way along from the top of Europe through the Middle East , down through Saigon are now subject to great efforts internally , in many of them , to seize control . If we are not prepared to assist them in making a better life for their people , then I believe that the prospects for freedom in those areas are uncertain . We must , I believe , assist them if we are determined to meet with commitments of assistance our words against the Communist advance . The burden is heavy we have carried it for many years . But I believe that this fight is not over . This battle goes on , and we have to play our part in it . And therefore I hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free . It was fitting that Congress opened its hearings on our new foreign military and economic aid programs in Washington at the very time that Khrushchev s words in Vienna were demonstrating as nothing else could the need for that very program . It should be well run , effectively administered , but I believe we must do it , and I hope that you , the American people , will support it again , because I think it is vitally important to the security of these areas . There is no use talking against the Communist advance unless we are willing to meet our responsibilities , however burdensome they may be . I do not justify this aid merely on the grounds of anti Communism . It is a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free , and we are not alone . I found that the people of France , for example , were doing far more in Africa in the way of aiding independent nations than our own country was . But I know that foreign aid is a burden that is keenly felt and I can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now . My stay in England was short but the visit gave me a chance to confer privately again with Prime Minister Macmillan , just as others of our party in Vienna were conferring yesterday with General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer . We all agreed that there is work to be done in the West and from our conversations have come agreed steps to get on with that work . Our day in London , capped by a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip was a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the West remains united in its determination to hold to its standards . May I conclude by saying simply that I am glad to be home . We have on this trip admired splendid places and seen stirring sights , but we are glad to be home . No demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you , the American people , have so generously given to our country . With that support I am not fearful of the future . We must be patient . We must be determined . We must be courageous . We must accept both risks and burdens , but with the will and the work freedom will prevail . Good night , and thank you very much .<speech_sep>Ladies and Gentlemen , Secretary I want to express my great appreciation at the opportunity to be here with you , and to express my thanks to all of you for having attended this conference . I asked those members of the Cabinet who felt they were physically fit to come here today , and I am delighted that Udall and Robert Kennedy and Governor Ribicoff responded to the challenge . Some years ago , another President of the United States who was also interested in physical fitness , Theodore Roosevelt , expressed some ambition that I think members of the armed services would improve their physical fitness . As there was some question about his , you will recall that he then rode a horse for a hundred miles . We do not have to prove it in 1961 . We take it for granted that the members of the administration are all physically fit and our presence here today is an effort to encourage all of you in your work . Since the time of the ancient Greeks , we have always felt that there was a close relationship between a strong , vital mind and physical fitness . It is our hope that using the influence of the National Government that we can expand this strong spirit among American men and women , that they will concern themselves with this phase of their personal development . We do not want in the United States a nation of spectators . We want a nation of participants in the vigorous life . This is not a matter which can be settled , of course , from Washington . It is really a matter which starts with each individual family . It is my hope that mothers and fathers , stretching across the United States , will be concerned about this phase of their children s development , that the communities will be concerned to make it possible for young boys and girls to participate actively in the physical life , and that men and women who have reached the age of maturity will concern themselves with maintaining their own participation in this phase of national vigor national life . I am hopeful that we can develop here today , with your help and suggestions , a program which will inspire our country to be concerned . I do not think we have to read these tests which we have seen so much of during the last 10 years to realize that because of the generosity of nature , because of the way our society is organized , that there has been less emphasis on national vigor , national vitality , physical well being , than there has been in many other countries of the world . I want to do better . And I think you want to do better . We want to make sure that as our life becomes more sophisticated , as we become more urbanized , that we do not lose this very valuable facet of our national character physical vitality , which is tied into qualities of character , which is tied into qualities of intellectual vigor and vitality . So I think that you are performing a real service in being here . We want your suggestions and ideas . This has to flow two ways , and we want the flow today to . come from you to tell us how you think we can use the influence of the National Government its prestige in order to increase the emphasis which we can place in every community across the country , in every home , in this most important program . I am particularly glad that we have here today teachers from over 67 countries who have been teaching in the United States and traveling through it , and who have now come to the National Capital before they return home . I hope they realize how much we learn from them this is a two way street , and all of these program which have brought hundreds of teachers in the last 15 to 20 years , which have brought them to all parts of the country that each of you leaves behind you an understanding of the problems and opportunities of your country , your culture , your civilization , what you believe and by your looking at us , we see something of ourselves . This is a program which we benefit from . In many ways , I think , we are the greater beneficiary , and I hope that when you go back to your countries , that you will tell them something of what we are trying to do here . You will tell them , though we may not always realize our high ambitions and our high goals , that nevertheless we are attempting to advance ourselves , and that there is tremendous interest in what is going on in the world around us . During the fall , I spoke , as many Members of Congress have spoken , about a Peace Corps . I am hopeful that it will be possible to bring that into realization , but what has been most interesting has been the great response of young men and women who desire not merely to serve the United States , but who desire to serve the cause of freedom which is common I think to all countries and to all people . I hope that when the Peace Corps ultimately is organized , and young men and women go out around the world , that they will place their greatest emphasis on teaching and secondly , that they will learn themselves far more than they will teach , and that we will therefore have another link which binds us to the world around us . I want to express my thanks to all of you , whether you come from across the sea or here in the United States . We are all involved in this great effort together . And therefore I wish you well . I express my thanks to all of you . I want you to know that we here in Washington are intimately concerned with the matters in which you are engaged . Thank you .<speech_sep>Chairman , ladies and gentlemen I appreciate very much your generous invitation to be here tonight . You bear heavy responsibilities these days and an article I read some time ago reminded me of how particularly heavily the burdens of present day events bear upon your profession . You may remember that in 1851 the New York Herald Tribune , under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley , employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of Karl Marx . We are told that foreign correspondent Marx , stone broke , and with a family ill and undernourished , constantly appealed to Greeley and Managing Editor Charles Dana for an increase in his munificent salary of 5 per installment , a salary which he and Engels ungratefully labeled as the lousiest petty bourgeois cheating . But when all his financial appeals were refused , Marx looked around for other means of livelihood and fame , eventually terminating his relationship with the Tribune and devoting his talents full time to the cause that would bequeath to the world the seeds of Leninism , Stalinism , revolution and the Cold War . If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent , history might have been different . And I hope all publishers will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper . I have selected as the title of my remarks tonight The President and the Press . Some may suggest that this would be more naturally worded The President Versus the Press . But those are not my sentiments tonight . It is true , however , that when a well known diplomat from another country demanded recently that our State Department repudiate certain newspaper attacks on his colleague it was unnecessary for us to reply that this Administration was not responsible for the press , for the press had already made it clear that it was not responsible for this Administration . Nevertheless , my purpose here tonight is not to deliver the usual assault on the so called one party press . On the contrary , in recent months I have rarely heard any complaints about political bias in the press except from a few Republicans . Nor is it my purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of Presidential press conferences . I think it is highly beneficial to have some 20 , 000 , 000 Americans regularly sit in on these conferences to observe , if I may say so , the incisive , the intelligent and the courteous qualities displayed by your Washington correspondents . Nor , finally , are these remarks intended to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any President and his family . If in the last few months your White House reporters and photographers have been attending church services with regularity , that has surely done them no harm . On the other hand , I realize that your staff and wire service photographers may be complaining that they do not enjoy the same green privileges at the local golf courses which they once did . It is true that my predecessor did not object as I do to pictures of one s golfing skill in action . But neither on the other hand did he ever bean a Secret Service man . My topic tonight is a more sober one of concern to publishers as well as editors . I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger . The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years . Whatever our hopes may be for the future for reducing this threat or living with it there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity . This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone , but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril . I refer , first , to the need for far greater public information and , second , to the need for far greater official secrecy . The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies , to secret oaths and to secret proceedings . We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it . Even today , there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions . Even today , there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it . And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment . That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control . And no official of my Administration , whether his rank is high or low , civilian or military , should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news , to stifle dissent , to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know . But I do ask every publisher , every editor , and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standards , and to recognize the nature of our country s peril . In time of war , the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort , based largely on self discipline , to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy . In time of clear and present danger , the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public s need for national security . Today no war has been declared and however fierce the struggle may be it may never be declared in the traditional fashion . Our way of life is under attack . Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe . The survival of our friends is in danger . And yet no war has been declared , no borders have been crossed by marching troops , no missiles have been fired . If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self discipline of combat conditions , then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security . If you are awaiting a finding of clear and present danger , then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent . It requires a change in outlook , a change in tactics , a change in missions by the government , by the people , by every businessman or labor leader , and by every newspaper . For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion , on subversion instead of elections , on intimidation instead of free choice , on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day . It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit , highly efficient machine that combines military , diplomatic , intelligence , economic , scientific and political operations . Its preparations are concealed , not published . Its mistakes are buried , not headlined . Its dissenters are silenced , not praised . No expenditure is questioned , no rumor is printed , no secret is revealed . It conducts the Cold War , in short , with a war time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match . Nevertheless , every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion . For the facts of the matter are that this nation s foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft , bribery or espionage that details of this nation s covert preparations to counter the enemy s covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader , friend and foe alike that the size , the strength , the location and the nature of our forces and weapons , and our plans and strategy for their use , have all been pinpointed in the press and other news media to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power and that , in at least one case , the publication of details concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed required its alteration at the expense of considerable time and money . The newspapers which printed these stories were loyal , patriotic , responsible and well meaning . Had we been engaged in open warfare , they undoubtedly would not have published such items . But in the absence of open warfare , they recognized only the tests of journalism and not the tests of national security . And my question tonight is whether additional tests should not now be adopted . That question is for you alone to answer . No public official should answer it for you . No governmental plan should impose its restraints against your will . But I would be failing in my duty to the Nation , in considering all of the responsibilities that we now bear and all of the means at hand to meet those responsibilities , if I did not commend this problem to your attention , and urge its thoughtful consideration . On many earlier occasions , I have said and your newspapers have constantly said that these are times that appeal to every citizen s sense of sacrifice and self discipline . They call out to every citizen to weigh his rights and comforts against his obligations to the common good . I cannot now believe that those citizens who serve in the newspaper business consider themselves exempt from that appeal . I have no intention of establishing a new Office of War Information to govern the flow of news . I am not suggesting any new forms of censorship or new types of security classifications . I have no easy answer to the dilemma that I have posed , and would not seek to impose it if I had one . But I am asking the members of the newspaper profession and the industry in this country to reexamine their own responsibilities , to consider the degree and the nature of the present danger , and to heed the duty of self restraint which that danger imposes upon us all . Every newspaper now asks itself , with respect to every story Is it news All I suggest is that you add the question Is it in the interest of the national security And I hope that every group in America unions and businessmen and public officials at every level will ask the same question of their endeavors , and subject their actions to this same exacting test . And should the press of America consider and recommend the voluntary assumption of specific new steps or machinery , I can assure you that we will cooperate whole heartedly with those recommendations . Perhaps there will be no recommendations . Perhaps there is no answer to the dilemma faced by a free and open society in a cold and secret war . In times of peace , any discussion of this subject , and any action that results , are both painful and without precedent . But this is a time of peace and peril which knows no precedent in history . It is the unprecedented nature of this challenge that also gives rise to your second obligation an obligation which I share . And that is our obligation to inform and alert the American people to make certain that they possess all the facts that they need , and understand them as well the perils , the prospects , the purposes of our program and the choices that we face . No President should fear public scrutiny of his program . For from that scrutiny comes understanding and from that understanding comes support or opposition . And both are necessary . I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration , but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people . For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed . I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers I welcome it . This Administration intends to be candid about its errors for , as a wise man once said An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it . We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors and we expect you to point them out when we miss them . Without debate , without criticism , no Administration and no country can succeed and no republic can survive . That is why the Athenian law maker Solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy . And that is why our press was protected by the First Amendment the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution not primarily to amuse and entertain , not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental , not to simply give the public what it wants but to inform , to arouse , to reflect , to state our dangers and our opportunities , to indicate our crises and our choices , to lead , mold , educate and sometimes even anger public opinion . This means greater coverage and analysis of international news for it is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local . It means greater attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improved transmission . And it means , finally , that government at all levels , must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security and we intend to do it . It was early in the Seventeenth Century that Francis Bacon remarked on three recent inventions already transforming the world the compass , gunpowder and the printing press . Now the links between the nations first forged by the compass have made us all citizens of the world , the hopes and threats of one becoming the hopes and threats of us all . In that one world s efforts to live together , the evolution of gunpowder to its ultimate limit has warned mankind of the terrible consequences of failure . And so it is to the printing press to the recorder of man s deeds , the keeper of his conscience , the courier of his news that we look for strength and assistance , confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be free and independent .<speech_sep>General , Secretary Zuckert , General LeMay , Members of the Congress , Fraser , fellow graduates I want to express my appreciation for becoming an instant graduate of this academy , and consider it a high honor . Salinger , Press Secretary of the White House , received the following letter several days ago Dear Sir Would you desire to become an honorary member of the Air Force Cadet Wing for granting one small favor Your name , Salinger , shall become more hallowed and revered than the combined memories of Generals Mitchell , Arnold , and Doolittle . My humble desire is that you convey a request from the Cadet Wing to the President . Sir , there are countless numbers of our group who are oppressed by Class 3 punishments , the bane of cadets everywhere . The President is our only hope for salvation . By granting amnesty to our oppressed brethren , he and you could end your anguish and depression . Please , sir , help us return to the ranks of the living so that we may work for the New Frontier with enthusiasm and vigor . It is signed Sincerely , Cadet Marvin Hopkins , who is obviously going to be a future General . As Salinger wants to be honored with Generals Mitchell , Arnold , and Doolittle , I therefore take great pleasure in granting amnesty to all those who not only deserve it , but need it . It is customary for speakers on these occasions to say in graduating addresses that commencement signifies the beginning instead of an end , yet this thought applies with particular force to those of you who are graduating from our Nation s service academies today , for today you receive not only your degrees , but also your commissions , and tomorrow you join with all those in the military service , in the foreign service , the civil service , and elsewhere , and one million of them serve outside our frontiers who have chosen to serve the Great Republic at a turning point in our history . You will have an opportunity to help make that history an opportunity for a service career more varied and demanding than any that has been opened to any officer corps in the history of any country . There are some who might be skeptical of that assertion . They claim that the future of the Air Force is mortgaged to an obsolete weapons system , the manned aircraft , or that Air Force officers of the future will be nothing more than silent silo sitters , but nothing could be further from the truth . It is this very onrush of technology which demands an expanding role for the Nation s Air Force and Air Force officers , and which guarantees that an Air Force career in the next 40 years will be even more changing and more challenging than the careers of the last 40 years . For some of you will travel where no man has ever traveled before . Some of you will fly the fastest planes that have ever been built , reach the highest altitudes that man has ever gone to , and lift the heaviest payloads of any aviator in history . Some of you will hold in your hands the most awesome destructive power which any nation or any man has conceived . Some of you will work with the leaders of new nations which were not even nations a few years ago . Some of you will support guerrilla and counter guerrilla operations that combine the newest techniques of warfare with the oldest techniques of the jungle , and some of you will help develop new planes that spread their wings in flight , detect other planes at an unheard of distance , deliver new weapons with unprecedented accuracy , and survey the ground from incredible heights as a testament to our strong faith in the future of air power and the manned airplane . I am announcing today that the United States will commit itself to an important new program in civilian aviation . Civilian aviation , long both the beneficiary and the benefactor of military aviation , is of necessity equally dynamic . Neither the economics nor the politics of international air competition permits us to stand still in this area . Today the challenging new frontier in commercial aviation and in military aviation is a frontier already crossed by the military supersonic flight . Leading members of the administration under the chairmanship of the Vice President have been considering carefully the role to be played by the National Government in determining the economic and technical feasibility of an American commercial supersonic aircraft , and in the development of such an aircraft if it be feasible . Having reviewed their recommendations , it is my judgment that this Government should immediately commence a new program in partnership with private industry to develop at the earliest practical date the prototype of a commercially successful supersonic transport superior to that being built in any other country of the world . An open , preliminary design competition will be initiated immediately among American airframe and powerplant manufacturers with a more detailed design phase to follow . If these initial phases do not produce an aircraft capable of transporting people and goods safely , swiftly , and at prices the traveler can afford and the airlines find profitable , we shall not go further . But if we can build the best operational plane of this type and I believe we can then the Congress and the country should be prepared to invest the funds and effort necessary to maintain this Nation s lead in long range aircraft , a lead we have held since the end of the Second World War , a lead we should make every responsible effort to maintain . Spurred by competition from across the Atlantic and by the productivity of our own companies , the Federal Government must pledge funds to supplement the risk capital to be contributed by private companies . It must then rely heavily on the flexibility and ingenuity of private enterprise to make the detailed decisions and to introduce successfully this new jet age transport into worldwide service , and we are talking about a plane in the end of the 60 s that will move ahead at a speed faster than Mach 2 to all corners of the globe . This commitment , I believe , is essential to a strong and forward looking Nation , and indicates the future of the manned aircraft as we move into a missile age as well . The fact that the greatest value of all of the weapons of massive retaliation lies in their ability to deter war does not diminish their importance , nor will national security in the years ahead be achieved simply by piling up bigger bombs or burying our missiles under bigger loads of concrete . For in an imperfect world where human folly has been the rule and not the exception , the surest way to bring on the war that can never happen is to sit back and assure ourselves it will not happen . The existence of mutual nuclear deterrents cannot be shrugged off as stalemate , for our national security in a period of rapid change will depend on constant reappraisal of our present doctrines , on alertness to new developments , on imagination and resourcefulness , and new ideas . Stalemate is a static term and not one of you would be here today if you believed you were entering an outmoded service requiring only custodial duties in a period of nuclear stalemate . I am impressed by the extraordinary scholastic record , unmatched by any new college or university in this country , which has been made by the students and graduates of this Academy . Four Rhodes scholarships last year , two this year , and other selected scholarships , and also your record in the graduate record examination makes the people of this country proud of this Academy and the Air Force which made it possible . This country is proud of the fact that more than one out of five of your all military faculty has a doctor s degree , and all the rest have master s degrees . This is what we need for leadership in our military services , for the Air Force officer of today and tomorrow requires the broadest kind of scholarship to understand a most complex and changing world . He requires understanding and learning unmatched in the days before World War IAny graduate of this Academy who serves in our Armed Forces will need to know economics and history , and international affairs , and languages . You will need an appreciation of other societies , and an understanding of our own Nation s purposes and policy . General Norstad s leadership in NATGeneral Smart s outstanding tour of duty as the senior military representative in Japan are examples of Air Force officers who use their broad talents for the benefit of our country . Many of you will have similar opportunities to represent this country in negotiations with our adversaries as well as our friends , working with international organizations , working in every way in the hundred free countries around the globe to help them maintain their freedom . Your major responsibilities , in the final analysis , will relate to military command . Some of you may be members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and participate as advisers to the President who holds office . Last October s crisis in the Caribbean amply demonstrated that military policy and power cannot and must not be separated from political and diplomatic decisions . Whatever the military motive and implications of the reckless attempt to put missiles on the island of Cuba , the political and psychological implications were equally important . We needed in October and we had them and we shall need them in the future , and we shall have them military commanders who are conscious of the enormous stakes in the nuclear age of every decision that they take , who are aware of the fact that there are no purely political . decisions or purely military decisions that . every problem is a mixture of both , men who know the difference between vital interests and peripheral interests , who can maneuver military forces with judgment and precision , as well as courage and determination , and who can foresee the effects of military action on political policy . We need men , in short , who can cope with the challenges of a new political struggle , an armed doctrine which uses every weapon in the struggle around the globe . We live in a world , in short , where the principal problems that we face are not susceptible to military solutions alone . The role of our military power , in essence , is , therefore , to free ourselves and our allies to pursue the goals of freedom without the danger of enemy attack , but we do not have a separate military policy , and a separate diplomatic policy , and a separate disarmament policy , and a separate foreign aid policy , all unrelated to each other . They are all bound up together in the policy of the United States . Our goal is a coherent , overall , national security policy , one that truly serves the best interests of this country and those who depend upon it . It is worth noting that all of the decisions which we now face today will come in increased numbers in the months and years ahead . I want to congratulate all of you who have chosen the United States Air Force as a career . As far as any of us can now see in Washington in the days ahead , you will occupy positions of the highest responsibility , and merely because we move into a changing period of weapon technology , as well as political challenge , because , in fact , we move into that period , there is greater need for you than ever before . You , here today on this field , your colleagues at Omaha , Nebraska , or at Eglin in Florida , or who may be stationed in Western Europe , or men who are at sea in ships hundreds of miles from land , or soldiers in camps in Texas , or on the Island of Okinawa , they maintain the freedom by being on the ready . They maintain the freedom , the security , and the peace not only of the United States , but of the dozens of countries who are allied to us who are close to the Communist power and who depend upon us and , in a sense , only upon us for their freedom and security . These distant ships , these distant planes , these distant men keep the peace in a great half circle stretching all the way from Berlin to South Korea . This is the role which history and our own determination has placed upon a country which lived most of its history in isolation and neutrality , and yet in the last 18 years has carried the burden for free people everywhere . I think that this is a burden which we accept willingly , recognizing that if this country does not accept it , no people will , recognizing that in the most difficult time in the whole life of freedom , the United States is called upon to play its greatest role . This is a role which we are proud to accept , and I am particularly proud to see the United States accept it in the presence of these young men who have committed themselves to the service of our country and to the cause of its freedom . I congratulate you all , and most of all , I congratulate your mothers and fathers who made it possible . Thank you .<speech_sep>President , and gentlemen I understand that President McKinley and I are the only two Presidents of the United States to ever address such an occasion . I suppose that President McKinley and I are the only two that are regarded as fiscally sound enough to be qualified for admission to this organization on an occasion such as this . I have not always considered the membership of the NAM as among my strongest supporters . I am not sure you have all approached the New Frontier with the greatest possible enthusiasm , and I was therefore somewhat nervous about accepting this invitation , until I did some studying of the history of this organization . I learned that this organization had once denounced on one occasion I will quote swollen bureaucracy as among the triumphs of Karl Marx , and decried on another occasion new governmental paternalism and socialism . I was comforted when reading this very familiar language to note that I was in very good company . For the first attack I quoted was on Calvin Coolidge and the second on Herbert Hoover . I remind you of this only to indicate the happy failure of many of our most pessimistic predictions . And that is true of all of us . I recognize that in the last campaign , most of the members of this luncheon group today supported my opponent , except for a very few who were under the impression that I was my father s son . But I hope that some of your most alarming feelings of a year ago about the imminent collapse of the whole business system if I was elected have been somewhat lessened . We have selected , I think , able men who I hope you have come to have a regard for , to serve in the responsible positions of the government . One of them here , our distinguished Secretary of Commerce , Governor Hodges , who had a long career in business Secretary Goldberg , who I think has earned the respect of business as well as labor Secretary of the Treasury Dillon and his Under Secretary Robert Roosa who was the Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Robert McNamara , whom many of you know , the Secretary of Defense John McCone , who is the head of the Central Intelligence Agency succeeding Dulles and Rusk , Secretary of State I think they are all men of experience and also , I think , they are vitally interested in the maintenance of all kinds of freedom in this country . I think that while we may not have been together a year ago , we are together now , and I will be the President of the United States for the next three years , and I am most anxious that while we may not agree on all matters , that goodwill at least will prevail among us and that we will both recognize that those of us who work in the national government , and all of you , are motivated by a desire to serve our country . Our responsibilities are different , but I believe that we can have a period , in the next few years , of cooperation between business and government in order to advance the common interest . I have read about the feeling of some businessmen that we are anti business , and I would think that a moment s thought would show how really untrue that must be . And I say it , really , for three reasons . In the first place , we are committed to the defense of freedom around the world . When business does well in this country , we have full employment , and this country is moving ahead , then it strengthens our image as a prosperous and vital country in this great fight in which we are engaged . When you do well , the United States does well , and our policies abroad do well . And when you do badly , all suffer . Secondly , we are unable to maintain the kind of high employment which we must maintain , unless you are making profits , and reinvesting , and producing and therefore as we are committed to the goal and we must all be in this country , of trying to make sure that everyone who wants a job will find it , then quite obviously we must make the system work , and the business community must prosper . And thirdly , and to put it on its most narrow basis , we are in the national government , and I know a rather unpopular partner in every one of your businesses . Our revenues come from you . When you are making profits , then we are able to meet our bills . When you fail , then we fail . So for every reason , government and business are completely interdependent and completely involved . And while we may differ on the policies which may bring this country prosperity , there is no disagreement , I am sure , on either side , about the tremendous importance of you gentlemen moving ahead , and prospering , and contributing to the growth of this country . And I hope , if nothing else , that my presence here today indicates that my remarks represent the views of all of us who occupy a position of responsibility in Washington today . It is not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor of building a prosperous America , in a world of free and prosperous states , of making the most of our human and material resources and avoiding the harmful effects and fluctuations of inflation and recession , are of course matters of the greatest importance to us all . And it is not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor proceeds under conditions today more fraught with peril than any in our history . As communism continues its long range drive to impose its way of life all around the world , our strongest desire is not unnaturally to seize the initiative , to get off the defensive , to do more than react to the Soviets . But while this is not an unreasonable urge , its concrete application is more difficult . In the military arena , the initiative rests with the aggressor a role that we shun by nature and tradition and our alliances are largely , therefore , defensive . In the paramilitary arenas of subversion , intimidation and insurrection , an open and peaceful society is again at a disadvantage . But there is one area , in particular , where the initiative can and has been ours an area of strategic importance in which we have the capacity for a still greater effort and that is in the area of economic policy . The Marshall Plan was an example of our initiative in this area . So were Point 4 and OECD and the Alliance for Progress . This year s new long range program to aid in the growth of the underdeveloped regions of the world , and the unaligned nations can bring us still further gains not merely as a blow against communism but as a blow for freedom . Of equal if not greater importance is the stunning evolution of Western European economic unity from treaty to concrete reality . And it is the success of this still growing movement which presents the West , at this time , with an historic opportunity to seize the initiative again . The United States is , in fact , required to do so for its own self interest and progress . The Communist Bloc , largely self contained and isolated , represents an economic power already by some standards larger than that of Western Europe and gaining to some degree on the United States . But the combined output and purchasing power of the United States and Western Europe is more than twice as great as that of the entire Sino Soviet Bloc . Though we have only half as much population , and far less than half as much territory , our coordinated economic strength will represent a powerful force for the maintenance and growth of freedom . But will our strength be combined and coordinated or divided and self defeating Will we work together on problems of trade , payments and monetary reserve or will our mutual strength be splintered by a network of tariff walls , exchange controls , and the pursuit of narrow self interest in unrelated if not outright hostile policies on aid , trade , procurement , interest rates and currency This is not a debate between deficit nations and surplus nations . It is not speculation over some grand design for the future . It is a hard , practical question for every member of the Western community involving most immediately for this nation our policies in two mutually dependent areas our balance of payments and our balance of trade . While exaggerated fears can be harmful , we would not inspire needed confidence abroad by reigning satisfaction with our international balance of payments position . In essence , that position reflects the burden of our responsibilities as the Free World s leader , the chief defender of freedom and the major source of capital investment around the world . As the cost of these responsibilities grows , and is not offset by foreign expenditures here , the monetary deficit in our relations with the rest of the world grows , except to the extent that our trade surplus can increase with it . During the previous three years , as competition in international markets increased , in spite of the fact that we had a generous balance in our favor in trade , our trade surplus did not keep pace with our needs . At the same time , higher interest rates in other countries as well as speculation in the price of gold attracted some American short term capital away from our shores . Our balance of payments was in deficit at a rate of nearly 4 billion dollars a year and , with its consequences extended by a weakened confidence in the dollar , we suffered over that 3 year period a net loss of 5 billion dollars in our gold reserve . The complete elimination of this problem is clearly some time off but so are any ultimately dangerous consequences . The United States still holds some 43 of the Free World s monetary gold stock , a proportion far larger than our share of its trade and clearly sufficient to tide us over a temporary deficit period and I emphasize the words temporary deficit period while we mount an offensive to reverse these trends . Our exports and export surplus have both been rising . The net claims of Americans against foreigners have doubled during the last decade , and the annual increase in the value of our assets abroad which now total nearly 45 billion dollars and must always be put in the balance sheet , when we are considering the movement of gold and dollars in the value of our assets abroad has regularly exceeded our payments deficit . Contrary to the assertion that this nation has been living beyond its means abroad , we have been increasing those means instead . This year , moreover , our wholesale prices have been steady . In fact , in spite of the recovery , our wholesale prices are a fraction less than they were in February , and in a very real sense , for the last three years , the United States has had generally stable prices . Confidence in the dollar has been upheld the speculation fever against the dollar has ceased the outflow of gold has been reduced from 2 billion dollars in the ten months before February 1961 , to 450 million dollars in the last ten months and , due partly to the temporary decline in imports that accompanied the recession , our general payments deficit in 1961 will be less than half of the 1960 deficit . There is cause for concern , in short , but I do not believe that there is cause for alarm . We should be blind neither to our basic strengths nor to our basic problems . A long term deficit requires long term solutions , and we must not be panicked by setbacks of a short run nature or the inevitable results of a reviving economy which has increased our imports and therefore leaves us in a less favorable position than we might have expected two or three months ago . For negative , shortsighted remedies will do more to weaken confidence in the dollar than strengthen it and this Administration , therefore , during its term of office , and I repeat this , and make it as a flat statement has no intention of imposing exchange controls , devaluing the dollar , raising trade barriers , or choking off our economic recovery . What we will do , and have been doing , is to take a series of positive steps to reduce our outpayments and to increase our receipts from abroad . First of all , we recognize , as already stressed . that this country cannot solve this problem alone . Our Allies have a vital interest in its solution . Because , let me repeat , if it were not for our national security commitments abroad , which defends our own interests and that of our Allies , the United States would have gold pouring in , rather than pouring out . It is this commitment which is extremely large and constant which gives us our problem , and should be so recognized . Our Allies , therefore , have a vital interest in the solution . Thus we have sought to increase the share of the contribution which other industrialized states are making to the less developed world and are seeking their assumption of a larger share of the cost of our joint defense requirements . We lose three billion dollars a year because of our defense expenditures . It costs us hundreds of millions of dollars to keep our troops in Western Germany . We lose nearly three hundred million dollars a year to France alone because of our defense expenditures in those areas . That three billion dollars , therefore , represents a charge in the interests of our national security , which is vitally important . That drain is serious . And it was because of that reason that President Eisenhower last year suggested the exceptional step of bringing back our dependents from Western Europe which would have saved two hundred and fifty million dollars . But three billion dollars represents the contribution which we make to our defense establishments abroad . The reason why the British , as you know , have been considering withdrawing some of their troops from bases stationed around the world is because of their balance of payments difficulty . The reason that they have been reluctant to station additional troops in Western Germany has been because of the same reason . In other words , therefore , the matter which we are now discussing , of trade , involves not only our economic wellbeing but the basic commitments of the United States to dozens of countries around the world . Unless our balance of trade , and our surplus , is sufficient , for example , to pay for this three billions of dollars , then we have no remedy but to start pulling back . So that for those who address themselves to this subject in the coming months , they must realize that it goes to the heart of our survival as well as our economic vitality . We are working with foreign governments now and central banks on new techniques for dealing in foreign currencies on coordinating our development aid , fiscal , debt management , monetary and other policies through the OECon preparing a new stand by lending authority for the International Monetary Fund on the prepayment of our Allies long term debts during this period of adverse trends and on increasing the proportion of their own military procurement in the United States , a very important move , because of the arrangements that have been recently made , that is expected to cut our payments deficit by at least another half a billion dollars next year . Secondly , to hold our own outlays abroad to the absolute essentials , we have emphasized procurement in this country for our military aid and overseas defense , and insisted upon it for three quarters of our economic aid . This means that our economic aid to these countries does not go as far as it once did . The South Koreans can buy fertilizer from Japan at half the cost that they can buy it here in the United States , and much less shipping . But because we are determined to protect our gold , and therefore our dollar , we have imposed the Buy American policy which means now that our losses because of economic aid abroad , our general program which amounts to about four billion dollars , is now down as far as our dollar loss to five hundred million dollars , and we are hopeful that we can squeeze it even down further . We have also substituted local currency expenditures for dollar expenditures to cover local costs wherever possible and sought to discourage heavy expenditures abroad by tourists to supplement restrictions already placed on military families . I will say I was alarmed to hear the other day of a study in the Defense Department of this question of dependents abroad , which indicated that those who had no dependents abroad spent more money abroad than those with dependents , so it indicates that for every solution there are additional problems . Third , to encourage a greater movement of funds in this direction , and to discourage transfers in these other directions , we have set up a new program to attract foreign visitors secured passage of a tax exemption encouraging foreign central banks to invest their capital in securities kept our own short term interest rates high enough to avoid unnecessary outflows and urged our Allies to free their own private capital for investment here . At the same time , we have directed the Treasury , for the first time in a generation , to buy and sell foreign currencies in the international exchange markets so as to strengthen its ability to offset unfavorable developments affecting the value of the dollar . Fourth , we have asked the Congress and this is a matter which is controversial and to which this group has taken exception we have asked the Congress to remove the artificial tax preference for American investment in highly developed countries with no capital shortage , and the unjustifiable tax avoidance loopholes available to those Americans investing in so called tax haven nations . We do not seek to penalize those who wish to invest their capital abroad . We are committed to the free flow of capital , but we also want to make sure that our tax laws do not encourage the outward movement of capital in a way which does not serve our national purpose . I am aware that many of you will argue that the investment abroad of these funds will mean that ultimately and in the long run these moneys will be coming back . But how long a run And how long can we afford , without taking every responsible step , to try to bring this in balance in the short run We cannot wait till 1970 , if we are losing two or three billion dollars a year . And we are now , for the first time , down to about sixteen billion , nine hundred million dollars in gold in the United States . So that I want to emphasize that however unsatisfactory you may feel it is , it is not being done to harass business , but only because it represents one additional effort to try to bring the dollar into balance . And if we can increase our trade so that our surplus in trade is sufficient to make up these figures , then this kind of tax would be unnecessary . Or , if this organization has some other plan or program which does not affect our national security which is more equitable , we will be glad to listen to that . But we are concerned that while capital moves freely , the tax policies do not stimulate it . And I emphasize this in saying again that I do not believe that exchange controls , based on the experience of the British and others , and our unique role as the banker of the world , would be either workable or helpful . But the recent flow of our capital to nations already fully developed has been a serious drain in the shortrun on our current balance of payments position . The eventual return from that capital is no help to us today . And at a time when we are hardpressed to pay for the maintenance of our forces in Europe without unreasonably increasing our payments deficit and our gold outflow , I am sure you must realize that it makes no sense to be encouraging an exodus of capital through tax laws that were more appropriate at a time when Europe was deficient in capital . You probably are familiar with these figures in 1960 , the long term outward flow of capital funds was a billion , seven hundred million dollars . The return was two billion , three hundred million dollars , and therefore you might argue that we are getting more back than we are sending out . But when those figures are broken down , we see that the outward investment into the developed countries , such as Western Europe , was a billion , five hundred million dollars , and the return was only one billion dollars , a loss therefore in dollars and potentially in gold of a half a billion dollars to these countries , while in the underdeveloped countries where we would like to see American capital be invested , we took in one billion , three hundred million and invested two hundred million dollars . So that I would say , gentlemen , that all of the proposals which we will have to put forward in the coming months and years to try to bring this into balance and I will say that we are going to reduce without weakening our defenses our expenditures for military purposes from three billion dollars to two billion dollars , we do have to use every available means that we have . And if this organization has suggestions as to how it may be done , we want to hear them . The best way , of course , is by increasing our exports . Fifth , and most important of all , we are seeking to increase our exports and thus our surplus of exports over imports . I shall discuss our opportunities , but it is worth while recounting now that we have embarked on a stepped up campaign of export promotion and trade fair exhibits increased our agricultural exports and to indicate the kind of problems that we are going to have , we send to Western Europe in agricultural exports nearly two billion dollars , which is one of our great dollar earners . We take in , in agricultural exports from Europe , only about 80 million dollars , a balance of trade for us of nearly a billion , 920 million dollars . And yet , as the Common Market begins to get more and more developed , with all of these countries beginning to face surplus problems , there is not any doubt that one of our most important problems in maintaining this kind of dollar flow would be to maintain the free flow of our agricultural commodities into the Common Market . There is going to be no more difficult task than that , and therefore we have to recognize that this , too , may affect our balance of payments . We have broadened the Export Import Bank s loan guarantee system created a new program of export credit insurance and in a variety of ways sought to help you to keep American prices competitive . This requires if we are to avoid the inflation that will price our goods out of the world markets price and wage restraint by both industry and labor , and responsible budget policies by the government . It requires if we are to offer modern products efficiently produced at a low cost a higher rate of investment in new equipment , encouraged by the fullest use of existing capacity in a strong recovery , by the investment tax credit now pending before the House Ways and Means Committee , and by the depreciation reform now under study and already put into effect on textile machinery . This organization has taken a position against our tax credit , and the reason is that you do not feel it is sufficient and you support a much more general overhaul of our depreciation . I support that , too , but our tax credit will cost a billion , 800 million in our revenue . We have suggested and I know this has been unpopular certain taxes to make up that revenue , because quite obviously we cannot carry out a tax reduction , in these critical times , without budget problems as difficult as they are . Therefore , while we would like , under ideal conditions , and had hoped , for example , to have a surplus this year before our additional expenditures for defense in July , it is very difficult for us to send up a broad tax depreciation scheme which might cost three billion dollars , with the expectation that other tax reductions would be added to it , at a time when we balance our budget with the greatest difficulty . So that we are not unsympathetic , and I can think of very few tax changes that would be more useful to the country in stimulating employment and keeping us competitive , particularly with Western Europe . And the only reason we have not gone further in it , and the only reason we have limited ourselves to the proposal which is now before the House Ways and Means Committee , is because we do not have the available revenue to provide for a tax reduction this year . So that I am hopeful , in making your position known to the Congress this year , that while you will continue to commit yourselves to depreciation changes and as I say , we have made some progress in textiles you will also recognize what our budgetary problems are , and work with us in attempting to get the best arrangements we can at this time , and plan for more satisfactory arrangements in the future . In short , achieving a healthy equilibrium in our international accounts depends in part upon the cooperation of our Allies in part upon action by the Congress in part upon the self discipline exercised by this Administration in its executive and budgetary policies and in part upon you and other members of the business community . I recognize that your efforts will be governed in part by the kind of atmosphere the government can help to create . That Is . why we intend to submit our balanced budget . The government must not be demanding more from the savings of the country , nor draining more from the available supplies of credit , when the national interest demands a priority for productive , creative investment not only to spur our growth at home but to make sure that we can sell , and sell effectively , in markets abroad . But your own responsibility is great and there are three things in particular that you can do be competitive , through lower costs and prices and better products and productivity . Be export minded . In a very real sense , the British used to say they exported or died . We are going to meet our commitments . We have got to export . And we have to increase our exports , and however impressive it has been in the past , it must be better in the future for the security of this country . And finally , be calm , in the sense of refraining from talk which really does not represent the facts , and which causes a concern about where we are going abroad . It is my hope that when we submit our balanced budget in January , that those who look at our fiscal situation from abroad and make their judgment , will recognize that we are in control , that we are moving ahead , and that the United States is a good bet . All of us must share in this effort for this in part , as I have said , is a part of the national security . And I do not want the United States pulling troops home because we are unable to meet our problems in other ways . But we can be calm because our basic international position is strong this year s deficit will be lower than last year s our gold stores are large and the outflow is easing we are going to make progress next year in diminishing it still further we will submit a balanced budget we are not undergoing a damaging inflation . We can , over the next few years , offset with the help of our Allies a billion dollars , as I have said , of our 3 billion overseas defense outlays reduce , with the help of the Congress , the money which goes because of tax advantages cut back still further that portion of our foreign aid procurement which is not already spent here and take the other steps I have mentioned , including an increase in our exports , for which all the additional tools we need are well within our reach . One of those tools one which we urgently need for our own well being is a new trade and tariff policy . The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act expires in June of next year . It must not simply be renewed it must be replaced . If the West is to take the initiative in the economic arena if the United States is to keep pace with the revolutionary changes which are taking place throughout the world if our exports are to retain and expand their position in the world market then we need a new and bold instrument of American trade policy . For the world of trade is no longer the same . Some 90 of the Free World s industrial production may soon be concentrated in two great markets the United States of America and an expanded European Common Market . Our own example of 50 States without a trade barrier behind a common external tariff helped to inspire the Common Market . Our support ever since the close of World War II has been thrown behind greater European unity . For we recognized long ago that such unity would produce a Europe in which the ancient rivalries which resulted in two world wars , for us as well as for them , could rest in peace a Europe in which the strength and the destiny of Germany would be inextricably tied with the West and a Europe no longer dependent upon us , but on the contrary , strong enough to share in full partnership with us the responsibilities and initiatives of the Free World . Now this new house of Europe that we sought so long , under different Administrations , is actually rising , and it means vast new changes in our outlook as well . With the accession of the United Kingdom and other European nations to the Common Market , they will have almost twice as many people as we do it will cover nations whose economies have been growing twice as fast as ours and it will represent an area with a purchasing power which some day will rival our own . It could be it should be our most reliable and profitable customer . Its consumer demands are growing particularly for the type of goods that we produce best , for American goods not previously sold and sometimes not even known in European markets today . It is an historic meeting of need and opportunity at the very time that we urgently need to increase our exports , to protect our balance of payments and to pay for our troops abroad , a vast new market is rising across the Atlantic . If , however , the United States is to enjoy this opportunity , it must have the means to persuade the Common Market to reduce external tariffs to a level which permits our products to enter on a truly competitive basis . That is why a trade policy adequate to deal with a large number of small states is no longer adequate . For almost thirty years , the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act has strengthened our foreign trade policy . But today the approaches and procedures provided for in that Act are totally irrelevant to the problems and opportunities that we confront . Its vitality is gone a fresh approach is essential and the longer we postpone its replacement , the more painful that step will be when it finally happens . For this is no longer a matter of local economic interest but of high national policy . We can no longer haggle over item by item reductions with our principal trading partners , but must adjust our trading tools to keep pace with world trading patterns and the EEC cannot bargain effectively on an item by item basis . I am proposing , in short , a new American trade initiative which will make it possible for the economic potential of these two great markets to be harnessed together in a team capable of pulling the full weight of our common military , economic and political aspirations . And I do not underrate at all the difficulties that we will have in developing this initiative . I am not proposing nor is it either necessary or desirable that we join the Common Market , alter our concepts of political sovereignty , establish a rich man s trading community , abandon our traditional most favored nations policy , create an Atlantic free trade area , or impair in any way our close economic ties with Canada , Japan and the rest of the Free World . And this , of course , is a problem of the greatest importance to us also . We do not want Japan left out of this great market , or Latin America which has depended so much on the European markets . It may find it now increasingly difficult because of competition from Africa to sell in Europe which could mean serious trouble for them and therefore for us in the long run both political as well as economic . I am not proposing nor is it either necessary or desirable that in setting new policies on imports we do away altogether with our traditional safeguards and institutions believe we can provide more meaningful concepts of injury and relief , and far speedier proceedings . We can use tariffs to cushion adjustment instead of using them only to shut off competition . And the Federal government can aid that process of adjustment , through a program I shall discuss further tomorrow not a welfare program , or a permanent subsidy , but a means of permitting the traditional American forces of adaptability and initiative to substitute progress for injury . For obviously our imports will also increase not as much as our exports , but they will increase . And we need those imports if other nations are to have the money to buy our exports and the incentive to lower their own tariff barriers . Because nobody is going to lower their barriers unless the United States makes a bargain with them which they feel to be in their own economic interest . We need those imports to give our consumers a wide choice of goods at competitive prices . We need those imports to give our industries and defense establishments the raw materials they require at prices they can afford and to keep a healthy pressure on our own producers and workers to improve efficiency , develop better products , and avoid the inflation that could price us out of markets vital to our own prosperity . Finally , let me make it clear that I am not proposing a unilateral lowering of our trade barriers . What I am proposing is a joint step on both sides of the Atlantic , aimed at benefiting not only the exporters Of the countries concerned but the economies of all of the countries of the Free World . Led by the two great Common Markets of the Atlantic , trade barriers in all the industrial nations must be brought down . Surely it will be said that the bold vision which produced the EEC will fall short if it merely transfers European protectionism from the national to the continental level . But if we can obtain from the Congress , and successfully use in negotiations , sufficient bargaining power to lower Common Market restrictions against our goods , every segment of the American economy will benefit . There are relatively few members of the business community who do not or could not transport , distribute or process either exports or imports . There are millions of American workers whose jobs depend on the sale of our goods abroad making industrial sewing machines , or trucks , or aircraft parts , or chemicals , or equipment for oil fields or mining or construction . They may produce lubricants or resin they may dig coal or plant cotton . In fact , the average American farmer today depends on foreign markets to sell the crops grown on one out of every six acres he plants in wheat , cotton , rice and tobacco , to name but a few examples . Our consumers , as mentioned , will benefit most of all . But if American industry cannot increase its sales to the Common Market , and increase this nation s surplus of exports over imports , our international payments position and our commitments to the defense of freedom will be endangered . If American businessmen cannot increase or even maintain their exports to the Common Market , they will surely step up their investment in new American owned plants behind those tariff walls so they can compete on an equal basis thereby taking capital away from us , as well as jobs from our own shores , and worsening still further our balance of payments position . If American industry cannot increase its outlets in the Common Market , our own expansion will be stifled the growth target of 50 in the sixties , adopted last month by the 20 nations of OECD for their combined gross national product , will not be reached and our business community will lack the incentives to lower prices and improve technology which greater competition would otherwise inspire . The industries which would benefit the most from increased trade are our most efficient even though in many cases they pay our highest wages , their goods can compete with the goods of any other nation . Those who would benefit the least , and are unwilling to adjust to competition , are standing in the way , as the NAM Economic Advisory Committee pointed out last year , of greater growth and a higher standard of living . They are endangering the profits and jobs of others , our efforts against inflation , our balance of payments position , and in the long run their own economic wellbeing because they will suffer from competition in the inevitably , if not from abroad for , in order to avoid exertion , they accept paralysis . Finally , let me add , if we cannot increase our sales abroad , we will diminish our stature in the Free World . Economic isolation and political leadership are wholly incompatible . The United Kingdom , faced with even more serious problems in her efforts to achieve both higher growth and reasonable balance of payments , is moving with boldness , welcoming , in the Prime Minister s words , the brisk shower of competition . We cannot do less . For if the nations of the West can weld together on these problems a common program of action as extraordinary in economic history as NATO was unprecedented in military history , the long range Communist aim of dividing and encircling us all is doomed to failure . In every sense of the word , therefore , Capitalism is on trial as we debate these issues . For many years in many lands , we have boasted of the virtues of the marketplace under free competitive enterprise , of America s ability to compete and sell , of the vitality of our system in keeping abreast with the times . Now the world will see whether we mean it or not whether America will remain the foremost economic power in the world or whether we will evacuate the field of power before a shot is fired , or go forth to meet new risks and tests of our ability . The hour of decision has arrived . We cannot afford to wait and see what happens , while the tide of events sweeps over and beyond us . We must use time as a tool , not as a couch . We must carve out our own destiny . This is what Americans have always done and this , I have every confidence , is what we will continue to do in each new trial and opportunity that lies ahead .<speech_sep>President Odegaard , members o the regents , members of the faculty , students , ladies and gentlemen It is a great honor on behalf of the people of the United States to extend to you congratulations on the Centennial Anniversary of this University , which represents 100 years of service to this State and country . This nation in two of the most critical times in the life of our country , once in the days after the Revolution in the Northwest ordinance to which Doctor Odegaard referred , and again during the most difficult days of the Civil War , in the Morrill Act which established our land grant colleges , this nation made a basic commitment to the maintenance of education , for the very reasons which Thomas Jefferson gave , that if this nation were to remain free it could not remain ignorant . The basis of self government and freedom requires the development of character and self restraint and perseverance and the long view . And these are qualities which require many years of training and education . So that I think this University and others like it across the country , and its graduates , have recognized that these schools are not maintained by the people of the various States in order to merely give the graduates of these schools an economic advantage in the life struggle . Rather , these schools are supported by our people because our people realize that this country has needed in the past , and needs today as never before , educated men and women who are committed to the cause of freedom . So for what this University has done in the past , and what its graduates can do now and in the future , I salute you . This University was rounded when the Civil War was already on , and no one could be sure in 1861 whether this country would survive . But the picture which the student of 1961 has of the world , and indeed the picture which our citizens have of the world , is infinitely more complicated and infinitely more dangerous . In 1961 the world relations of this country have become tangled and complex . One of our former allies has become our adversary and he has his own adversaries who are not our allies . Heroes are removed from their tombs history rewritten the names of cities changed overnight . We increase our arms at a heavy cost , primarily to make certain that we will not have to use them . We must face up to the chance of war , if we are to maintain the peace . We must work with certain countries lacking in freedom in order to strengthen the cause of freedom . We find some who call themselves neutral who are our friends and sympathetic to us , and others who call themselves neutral who are unremittingly hostile to us . And as the most powerful defender of freedom on earth , we find ourselves unable to escape the responsibilities of freedom , and yet unable to exercise it without restraints imposed by the very freedoms we seek to protect . We cannot , as a free nation , compete with our adversaries in tactics of terror , assassination , false promises , counterfeit mobs and crises . We cannot , under the scrutiny of a free press and public , tell different stories to different audiences , foreign and domestic , friendly and hostile . We cannot abandon the slow processes of consulting with our allies to match the swift expediencies of those who merely dictate to their satellites . We can neither abandon nor control the international organization in which we now cast less than 1 percent of the vote in the General Assembly . We possess weapons of tremendous power but they are least effective in combating the weapons most often used by freedom s foes subversion , infiltration , guerrilla warfare , civil disorder . We send arms to other peoples just as we send them the ideals of democracy in which we believe but we cannot send them the will to use those arms or to abide by those ideals . And while we believe not only in the force of arms but in the force of right and reason , we have learned that reason does not always appeal to unreasonable men that it is not always true that a soft answer turneth away wrath and that right does not always make might . In short , we must face problems which do not lend themselves to easy or quick or permanent solutions . And we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient that we are only 6 percent of the world s population that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem . These burdens and frustrations are accepted by most Americans with maturity and understanding . They may long for the days when war meant charging up San Juan Hill or when our isolation was guarded by two oceans or when the atomic bomb was ours alone or when much of the industrialized world depended upon our resources and our aid . But they now know that those days are gone and that gone with them are the old policies and the old complacency s . And they know , too , that we must make the best of our new problems and our new opportunities , whatever the risk and the cost . But there are others who cannot bear the burden of a long twilight struggle . They lack confidence in our long run capacity to survive and succeed . Hating communism , yet they see communism in the long run , perhaps , as the wave of the future . And they want some quick and easy and final and cheap solution now . There are two groups of these frustrated citizens , far apart in their views yet very much alike in their approach . On the one hand are those who urge upon us what I regard to be the pathway of surrender appeasing our enemies , compromising our commitments , purchasing peace at any price , disavowing our arms , our friends , our obligations . If their view had prevailed , the world of free choice would be smaller today . On the other hand are those who urge upon us what I regard to be the pathway of war equating negotiations with appeasement and substituting rigidity for firmness . If their view had prevailed , we would be at war today , and in more than one place . It is a curious fact that each of these extreme opposites resembles the other . Each believes that we have only two choices appeasement or war , suicide or surrender , humiliation or holocaust , to be either Red or dead . Each side sees only hard and soft nations , hard and soft policies , hard and soft men . Each believes that any departure from its own course inevitably leads to the other one group believes that any peaceful solution means appeasement the other believes that any arms build up means war . One group regards everyone else as warmongers , the other regards everyone else as appeasers . Neither side admits that its path will lead to disaster but neither can tell us how or where to draw the line once we descend the slippery slopes of appeasement or constant intervention . In short , while both extremes profess to be the true realists of our time , neither could be more unrealistic . While both claim to be doing the nation a service , they could do it no greater disservice . This kind of talk and easy solutions to difficult problems , if believed , could inspire a lack of confidence among our people when they must all above all else be united in recognizing the long and difficult days that lie ahead . It could inspire uncertainty among our allies when above all else they must be confident in us . And even more dangerously , it could , if believed , inspire doubt among our adversaries when they must above all be convinced that we will defend our vital interests . The essential fact that both of these groups fail to grasp is that diplomacy and defense are not substitutes for one another . Either alone would fail . A willingness to resist force , unaccompanied by a willingness to talk , could provoke belligerence while a willingness to talk , unaccompanied by a willingness to resist force , could invite disaster . But as long as we know what comprises our vital interests and our long range goals , we have nothing to fear from negotiations at the appropriate time , and nothing to gain by refusing to take part in them . At a time when a single clash could escalate overnight into a holocaust of mushroom clouds , a great power does not prove its firmness by leaving the task of exploring the other s intentions to sentries or those without full responsibility . Nor can ultimate weapons rightfully be employed , or the ultimate sacrifice rightfully demanded of our citizens , until every reasonable solution has been explored . How many wars , Winston Churchill has written , have been averted by patience and persisting good will . . . . How many wars have been precipitated by firebrands If vital interests under duress can be preserved by peaceful means , negotiations will find that out . If our adversary will accept nothing less than a concession of our rights , negotiations will find that out . And if negotiations are to take place , this nation cannot abdicate to its adversaries the task of choosing the forum and the framework and the time . For there are carefully defined limits within which any serious negotiations must take place . With respect to any future talks on Germany and Berlin , for example , we cannot , on the one hand , confine our proposals to a list of concessions we are willing to make , nor can we , on the other hand , advance any proposals which compromise the security of free Germans and West Berliners , or endanger their ties with the West . No one should be under the illusion that negotiations for the sake of negotiations always advance the cause of peace . If for lack of preparation they break up in bitterness , the prospects of peace have been endangered . If they are made a forum for propaganda or a cover for aggression , the processes of peace have been abused . But it is a test of our national maturity to accept the fact that negotiations are not a contest spelling victory or defeat . They may succeed they may fail . They are likely to be successful only if both sides reach an agreement which both regard as preferable to the status quo an agreement in which each side can consider its own situation to be improved . And this is most difficult to obtain . But , while we shall negotiate freely , we shall not negotiate freedom . Our answer to the classic question of Patrick Henry is still no life is not so dear , and peace is not so precious , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery . And that is our answer even though , for the first time since the ancient battles between Greek city states , war entails the threat of total annihilation , of everything we know , of society itself . For to save mankind s future freedom , we must face up to any risk that is necessary . We will always seek peace but we will never surrender . In short , we are neither warmongers nor appeasers , neither hard nor soft . We are Americans , determined to defend the frontiers of freedom , by an honorable peace if peace is possible , but by arms if arms are used against us . And if we are to move forward in that spirit , we shall need all the calm and thoughtful citizens that this great University can produce , all the light they can shed , all the wisdom they can bring to bear . It is customary , both here and around the world , to regard life in the United States as easy . Our advantages are many . But more than any other people on earth , we bear burdens and accept risks unprecedented in their size and their duration , not for ourselves alone but for all who wish to be free . No other generation of free men in any country has ever faced so many and such difficult challenges not even those who lived in the days when this University was founded in 1861 . This nation was then torn by war . This territory had only the simplest elements of civilization . And this city had barely begun to function . But a university was one of their earliest thoughts and they summed it up in the motto that they adopted Let there be light . What more can be said today , regarding all the dark and tangled problems we face than Let there be light . And to accomplish that illumination , the University of Washington shall still hold high the torch .<speech_sep>Senator Moss , my old colleague in the United States Senate , your distinguished Senator Moss , President McKay , Brown , Secretary Udall , Governor , Rawlings , ladies and gentlemen I appreciate your welcome , and I am very proud to be back in this historic building and have an opportunity to say a few words on some matters which concern me as President , and I hope concern you as citizens . The fact is , I take strength and hope in seeing this monument , hearing its story retold by Ted Moss , and recalling how this State was built , and what it started with , and what it has now . Of all the stories of American pioneers and settlers , none is more inspiring than the Mormon trail . The qualities of the founders of this community are the qualities that we seek in America , the qualities which we like to feel this country has , courage , patience , faith , self reliance , perseverance , and , above all , an unflagging determination to see the right prevail . I came on this trip to see the United States , and I can assure you that there is nothing more encouraging for any of us who work in Washington than to have a chance to fly across this United States , and drive through it , and see what a great country it is , and come to understand somewhat better how this country has been able for so many years to carry so many burdens in so many parts of the world . The primary reason for my trip was conservation , and I include in conservation first our human resources and then our natural resources , and I think this State can take perhaps its greatest pride and its greatest satisfaction for what it has done , not in the field of the conservation and the development of natural resources , but what you have done to educate your children . This State has a higher percentage per capita of population of its boys and girls who finish high school and then go to college . Of all the waste in the United States in the 1960 s , none is worse than to have 8 or 9 million boys and girls who will drop out , statistics tell us , drop out of school before they have finished , come into the labor market unprepared at the very time when machines are taking the place of men and women 9 million of them . We have a large minority of our population who have not even finished the sixth grade , and here in this richest of all countries , the country which spreads the doctrine of freedom and hope around the globe , we permit our most valuable resource , our young people , their talents to be wasted by leaving their schools . So I think we have to save them . I think we have to insist that our children be educated to the limit of their talents , not just in your State , or in Massachusetts , but all over the United States . Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , who developed the Northwest Ordinance , which put so much emphasis on education Thomas Jefferson once said that any nation which expected to be ignorant and free , hopes for what never was and never will be . So I hope we can conserve this resource . The other is the natural resource of our country , particularly the land west of the 100th parallel , where the rain comes 15 or 20 inches a year . This State knows that the control of water is the secret of the development of the West , and whether we use it for power , or for irrigation , or for whatever purpose , no drop of water west of the 100th parallel should flow to the ocean without being used . And to do that requires the dedicated commitment of the people of the States of the West , working with the people of all the United States who have such an important equity in the richness of this part of the country . So that we must do also . As Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot did it in years past , we must do it in the 1960 s and 1970 s . We will triple the population of this country in the short space of 60 or 70 years , and we want those who come after us to have the same rich inheritance that we find now in the United States . This is the reason for the trip , but it is not what I wanted to speak about tonight . I want to speak about the responsibility that I feel the United States has not in this country , but abroad , and I see the closest interrelationship between the strength of the United States here at home and the strength of the United States around the world . There is one great natural development here in the United States which has had in its own way a greater effect upon the position and influence and prestige of the United States , almost , than any other act we have done . Do you know what it is It is the Tennessee Valley . Nearly every leader of every new emerging country that comes to the United States wants to go to New York , to Washington , and the Tennessee Valley , because they want to see what we were able to do with the most poverty ridden section of the United States in the short space of 30 years , by the wise management of our resources . What happens here in this country affects the security of the United States and the cause of freedom around the globe . If this is a strong , vital , and vigorous society , the cause of freedom will be strong and vital and vigorous . I know that many of you in this State and other States sometimes wonder where we are going and why the United States should be so involved in so many affairs , in so many countries all around the globe . If our task on occasion seems hopeless , if we despair of ever working our will on the other 94 percent of the world population , then let us remember that the Mormons of a century ago were a persecuted and prosecuted minority , harried from place to place , the victims of violence and occasionally murder , while today , in the short space of 100 years , their faith and works are known and respected the world around , and their voices heard in the highest councils of this country . As the Mormons succeeded , so America can succeed , if we will not give up or turn back . I realize that the burdens are heavy and I realize that there is a great temptation to urge that we relinquish them , that we have enough to do here in the United States , and we should not be so busy around the globe . The fact of the matter is that we , this generation of Americans , are the first generation of our country ever to be involved in affairs around the globe . From the ginning of this country , from the days of Washington , until the Second World War , this country lived an isolated existence . Through most of our history we were an unaligned country , an uncommitted nation , a neutralist nation . We were by statute as well as by desire . We had believed that we could live behind our two oceans in safety and prosperity in a comfortable distance from the rest of the world . The end of isolation consequently meant a wrench with the very lifeblood , the very spine , of the Nation . Yet , as time passed , we came to see that the end of isolation was not such a terrible error or evil after all . We came to see that it was the inevitable result of growth , the economic growth , the military growth , and the cultural growth of the United States . No nation so powerful and so dynamic and as rich as our own could hope to live in isolation from other nations , especially at a time when science and technology was making the world so small . It took Brigham Young and his followers 108 days to go from Winter Quarters , Nebraska , to the valley of the Great Salt Lake . It takes 30 minutes for a missile to go from one continent to another . We did not seek to become a world power . This position was thrust upon us by events . But we became one just the same , and I am proud that we did . I can well understand the attraction of those earlier days . Each one of us has moments of longing for the past , but two world wars have clearly shown us , try as we may , that we cannot turn our back on the world outside . If we do , we jeopardize our economic well being , we jeopardize our political stability , we jeopardize our physical safety . To turn away now is to abandon the world to those whose ambition is to destroy a free society . To yield these burdens up after having carried them for more than 20 years is to surrender the freedom of our country inevitably , for without the United States , the chances of freedom surviving , let alone prevailing around the globe , are nonexistent . Americans have come a long way in accepting in a short time the necessity of world involvement , but the strain of this involvement remains and we find it all over the country . I see it in the letters that come to my desk every day . We find ourselves entangled with apparently unanswerable problems in unpronounceable places . We discover that our enemy in one decade is our ally the next . We find ourselves committed to governments whose actions we cannot often approve , assisting societies with principles very different from our own . The burdens of maintaining an immense military establishment with one million Americans serving outside our frontiers , of financing a far flung program of development assistance , of conducting a complex and baffling diplomacy , all weigh heavily upon us and cause some to counsel retreat . The world is full of contradiction and confusion , and our policy seems to have lost the black and white clarity of simpler times when we remembered the Maine and went to War . It is little wonder , then , in this confusion , we look back to the old days with nostalgia . It is little wonder that there is a desire in the country to go back to the time when our Nation lived alone . It is little wonder that we increasingly want an end to entangling alliances , an end to all help to foreign countries , a cessation of diplomatic relations with countries or states whose principles we dislike , that we get the United Nations out of the United States , and the United States out of the United Nations , and that we retreat to our own hemisphere , or even within our own boundaries , to take refuge behind a wall of force . This is an understandable effort to recover an old feeling of simplicity , yet in world affairs , as in all other aspects of our lives , the days of the quiet past are gone forever . Science and technology are irreversible . We cannot return to the day of the sailing schooner or the covered wagon , even if we wished . And if this Nation is to survive and succeed in the real world of today , we must acknowledge the realities of the world and it is those realities that I mention now . We must first of all recognize that we cannot remake the world simply by our own command . When we cannot even bring all of our own people into full citizenship without acts of violence , we can understand how much harder it is to control events beyond our borders . Every nation has its own traditions , its own values , its own aspirations . Our assistance from time to time can help other nations preserve their independence and advance their growth , but we cannot remake them in our own image . We cannot enact their laws , nor can we operate their governments or dictate our policies . Second , we must recognize that every tion determines its policies in terms of its own interests . No nation , George Washington wrote , is to be trusted farther than it is bound by its interest and no prudent statesman or politician will depart from it . National interest is more powerful than ideology , and the recent developments within the Communist empire show this very clearly . Friendship , as Palmerston said , may rise or wane , but interests endure . The United States has rightly determined , in the years since 1945 under three different administrations , that our interest , our national security , the interest of the United States of America , is best served by preserving and protecting a world of diversity in which no one power or no one combination of powers can threaten the security of the United States . The reason that we moved so far into the world was our fear that at the end of the war , and particularly when China became Communist , that Japan and Germany would collapse , and these two countries which had so long served as a barrier to the Soviet advance , and the Russian advance before that , would open up a wave of conquest of all of Europe and all of Asia , and then the balance of power turning against us we would finally be isolated and ultimately destroyed . That is what we have been engaged in for 18 years , to prevent that happening , to prevent any one monolithic power having sufficient force to destroy the United States . For that reason we support the alliances in Latin America for that reason we support NATO to protect the security of Western Europe for that reason we joined SEATO to protect the security of Asia so that neither Russia nor China could control Europe and Asia , and if they could not control Europe and Asia , then our security was assured . This is what we have been involved in doing . And however dangerous and hazardous it may be , and however close it may take us to the brink on occasion , which it has , and however tired we may get of our involvements with these governments so far away , we have one simple central theme of American foreign policy which all of us must recognize , because it is a policy which we must continue to follow , and that is to support the independence of nations so that one bloc cannot gain sufficient power to finally overcome us . There is no mistaking the vital interest of the United States in what goes on around the world . Therefore , accepting what George Washington said here , I realize that what George Washington said about no intangling alliances has been ended by science and technology and danger . And third , we must recognize that foreign policy in the modern world does not lend itself to easy , simple black and white solution . If we were to have diplomatic relations only with those countries whose principles we approved of , we would have relations with very few countries in a very short time . If we were to withdraw our assistance from all governments who are run differently from our own , we would relinquish half the world immediately to our adversaries . If we were to treat foreign policy as merely a medium for delivering self righteous sermons to supposedly inferior people , we would give up all thought of world influence or world leadership . For the purpose of foreign policy is not to provide an outlet for our own sentiments of hope or indignation it is to shape real events in a real world . We cannot adopt a policy which says that if something does not happen , or others do not do exactly what we wish , we will return to Fortress America . That is the policy in this changing world of retreat , not of strength . More important , to adopt a black or white , all or nothing policy subordinates our interest to our irritations . Its actual consequences would be fatal to our security . If we were to resign from the United Nations , break off with all countries of whom we disapprove , end foreign aid and assistance to those countries in an attempt to keep them free , call for the resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing , and turn our back on the rest of mankind , we would not only be abandoning America s influence in the world , we would be inviting a Communist expansion which every Communist power would so greatly welcome . And all of the effort of so many Americans for 18 years would be gone with the wind . Our policy under those conditions , in this dangerous world , would not have much deterrent effect in a world where nations determined to be free could no longer count on the United States . Such a policy of retreat would be folly if we had our backs to the wall . It is surely even greater folly at a time when more realistic , more responsible , more affirmative policies have wrought such spectacular resuits . For the most striking thing about our world in 1963 is the extent to which the tide of history has begun to flow in the direction of freedom . To renounce the world of freedom now , to abandon those who share our commitment , and retire into lonely and not so splendid isolation , would be to give communism the one hope which , in this twilight of disappointment for them , might repair their divisions and rekindle their hope . For after some gains in the fifties the Communist offensive , which claimed to be riding the tide of historic inevitability , has been thwarted and turned back in recent months . Indeed , the whole theory of historical inevitability , the belief that all roads must lead to communism , sooner or later , has been shattered by the determination of those who believe that men and nations will pursue a variety of roads , that each nation will evolve according to its own traditions and its own aspirations , and that the world of the future will have room for a diversity of economic systems , political creeds , religious faiths , united by the respect for others , and loyalty to a world order . Those forces of diversity which served Washington s national interest those forces of diversity are in the ascendancy today , even within the Communist empire itself . And our policy at this point should be to give the forces of diversity , as opposed to the forces of uniformity , which our adversaries espouse , every chance , every possible support . That is why our assistance program , so much maligned , of assisting countries to maintain their freedom , I believe , is important . This country has seen all of the hardship and the grief that has come to us by the loss of one country in this hemisphere , Cuba . How many other countries must be lost if the United States decides to end the programs that are helping these people , who are getting poorer every year , who have none of the resources of this great country , who look to us for help , but on the other hand in cases look to the Communists for example That is why I think this program is important . It is a means of assisting those who want to be free , and in the final analysis it serves the United States in a very real sense . That is why the United Nations is important , not because it can solve all these problems in this imperfect world , but it does give us a means , in those great moments of crisis , and in the last 21 2 years we have had at least three , when the Soviet Union and the United States were almost face to face on a collision course it does give us a means of providing , as it has in the Congo , as it now is on the border of the Yemen , as it most recently was in a report of the United Nations at Malaysia it does give a means to mobilize the opinion of the world to prevent an atomic disaster which would destroy us all wherever we might live . That is why the test ban treaty is important as a first step , perhaps to be disappointed , perhaps to find ourselves ultimately set back , but at least in 1963 the United States committed itself , and the Senate of the United States , by an overwhelming vote , to one chance to end the radiation and the possibilities of burning . It may be , as I said , that we may fail , but anyone who bothers to look at the true destructive power of the atom today and what we and the Soviet Union could do to each other and the world in an hour and in a day , and to Western Europe I passed over yesterday the Little Big Horn where General Custer was slain , a massacre which has lived in history , 400 or 500 men . We are talking about 300 million men and women m 24 hours . I think it is wise to take a first step to lessen the possibility of that happening . And that is why our diplomacy is important . For the forces making for diversity are to be found everywhere where people are , even within the Communist empire , and it is our obligation to encourage those forces wherever they may be found . Hard and discouraging questions remain in Viet Nam , in Cuba , in Laos , the Congo , all around the globe . The ordeal of the emerging nations has just begun . The control of nuclear weapons is still incomplete . The areas of potential friction , the chances of collision , still exist . But in every one of these areas the position of the United States , I believe , is happier and safer when history is going for us rather than when it is going against us . And we have history going for us today , but history is what men make it . The future is what men make it . We cannot fulfill our vision and our commitment and our interest in a free and diverse future without unceasing vigilance , devotion , and , most of all , perseverance , a willingness to stay with it , a willingness to do with fatigue , a willingness not to accept easy answers , but instead , to maintain the burden , as the people of this State have done for 100 years , and as the United States must do the rest of this century until finally we live in a peaceful world . Therefore , I think this country will continue its commitments to support the world of freedom , for as we discharge that commitment we are heeding the command which Brigham Young heard from the Lord more than a century ago , the command he conveyed to his followers , Go as pioneers . . . to a land of peace . Thank you .<speech_sep>
