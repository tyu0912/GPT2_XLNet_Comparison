Catledge , members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors , ladies and gentlemen The President of a great democracy such as ours , and the editors of great newspapers such as yours , owe a common obligation to the people an obligation to present the facts , to present them with candor , and to present them in perspective . It is with that obligation in mind that I have decided in the last 24 hours to discuss briefly at this time the recent events in Cuba . On that unhappy island , as in so many other arenas of the contest for freedom , the news has grown worse instead of better . I have emphasized before that this was a struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator . While we could not be expected to hide our sympathies , we made it repeatedly clear that the armed forces of this country would not intervene in any way . Any unilateral American intervention , in the absence of an external attack upon ourselves or an ally , would have been contrary to our traditions and to our international obligations . But let the record show that our restraint is not inexhaustible . Should it ever appear that the inter American doctrine of non interference merely conceals or excuses a policy of nonaction if the nations of this Hemisphere should fail to meet their commitments against outside Communist penetration then I want it clearly understood that this Government will not hesitate in meeting its primary obligations which are to the security of our Nation Should that time ever come , we do not intend to be lectured on intervention by those whose character was stamped for all time on the bloody streets of Budapest Nor would we expect or accept the same outcome which this small band of gallant Cuban refugees must have known that they were chancing , determined as they were against heavy odds to pursue their courageous attempts to regain their Island s freedom . But Cuba is not an island unto itself and our concern is not ended by mere expressions of nonintervention or regret . This is not the first time in either ancient or recent history that a small band of freedom fighters has engaged the armor of totalitarianism . It is not the first time that Communist tanks have rolled over gallant men and women fighting to redeem the independence of their homeland . Nor is it by any means the final episode in the eternal struggle of liberty against tyranny , anywhere on the face of the globe , including Cuba itself . Castro has said that these were mercenaries . According to press reports , the final message to be relayed from the refugee forces on the beach came from the rebel commander when asked if he wished to be evacuated . His answer was I will never leave this country . That is not the reply of a mercenary . He has gone now to join in the mountains countless other guerrilla fighters , who are equally determined that the dedication of those who gave their lives shall not be forgotten , and that Cuba must not be abandoned to the Communists . And we do not intend to abandon it either The Cuban people have not yet spoken their final piece . And I have no doubt that they and their Revolutionary Council , led by Cardona and members of the families of the Revolutionary Council , I am informed by the Doctor yesterday , are involved themselves in the Islands will continue to speak up for a free and independent Cuba . Meanwhile we will not accept Castro s attempts to blame this nation for the hatred which his onetime supporters now regard his repression . But there are from this sobering episode useful lessons for us all to learn . Some may be still obscure , and await further information . Some are clear today . First , it is clear that the forces of communism are not to be underestimated , in Cuba or anywhere else in the world . The advantages of a police state its use of mass terror and arrests to prevent the spread of free dissent cannot be overlooked by those who expect the fall of every fanatic tyrant . If the self discipline of the free cannot match the iron discipline of the mailed fist in economic , political , scientific and all the other kinds of struggles as well as the military then the peril to freedom will continue to rise . Secondly , it is clear that this Nation , in concert with all the free nations of this hemisphere , must take an ever closer and more realistic look at the menace of external Communist intervention and domination in Cuba . The American people are not complacent about Iron Curtain tanks and planes less than 90 miles from their shore . But a nation of Cuba s size is less a threat to our survival than it is a base for subverting the survival of other free nations throughout the hemisphere . It is not primarily our interest or our security but theirs which is now , today , in the greater peril . It is for their sake as well as our own that we must show our will . The evidence is clear and the hour is late . We and our Latin friends will have to face the fact that we cannot postpone any longer the real issue of survival of freedom in this hemisphere itself . On that issue , unlike perhaps some others , there can be no middle ground . Together we must build a hemisphere where freedom can flourish and where any free nation under outside attack of any kind can be assured that all of our resources stand ready to respond to any request for assistance . Third , and finally , it is clearer than ever that we face a relentless struggle in every corner of the globe that goes far beyond the clash of armies or even nuclear armaments . The armies are there , and in large number . The nuclear armaments are there . But they serve primarily as the shield behind which subversion , infiltration , and a host of other tactics steadily advance , picking off vulnerable areas one by one in situations which do not permit our own armed intervention . Power is the hallmark of this offensive power and discipline and deceit . The legitimate discontent of yearning people is exploited . The legitimate trappings of self determination are employed . But once in power , all talk of discontent is repressed , all self determination disappears , and the promise of a revolution of hope is betrayed , as in Cuba , into a reign of terror . Those who on instruction staged automatic riots in the streets of free nations over the efforts of a small group of young Cubans to regain their freedom should recall the long roll call of refugees who cannot now go back to Hungary , to North Korea , to North Viet Nam , to East Germany , or to Poland , or to any of the other lands from which a steady stream of refugees pours forth , in eloquent testimony to the cruel oppression now holding sway in their homeland . We dare not fail to see the insidious nature of this new and deeper struggle . We dare not fail to grasp the new concepts , the new tools , the new sense of urgency we will need to combat it whether in Cuba or South Viet Nam . And we dare not fail to realize that this struggle is taking place every day , without fanfare , in thousands of villages and markets day and night and in classrooms all over the globe . The message of Cuba , of Laos , of the rising din of Communist voices in Asia and Latin America these messages are all the same . The complacent , the self indulgent the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history . Only the strong , only the industrious , only the determined , only the courageous , only the visionary who determine the real nature of our struggle can possibly survive . No greater task faces this country or this administration . No other challenge is more deserving of our every effort and energy . Too long we have fixed our eyes on traditional military needs , on armies prepared to cross borders , on missiles poised for flight . Now it should be clear that this is no longer enough that our security may be lost piece by piece , country by country , without the firing of a single missile or the crossing of a single border . We intend to profit from this lesson . We intend to reexamine and reorient our forces of all kinds our tactics and our institutions here in this community . We intend to intensify our efforts for a struggle in many ways more difficult than war , where disappointment will often accompany us . For I am convinced that we in this country and in the free world possess the necessary resource , and the skill , and the added strength that comes from a belief in the freedom of man . And I am equally convinced that history will record the fact that this bitter struggle reached its climax in the late 1950 s and the early 1960 s . Let me then make clear as the President of the United States that I am determined upon our system s survival and success , regardless of the cost and regardless of the peril<speech_sep>In the first place I have never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present . In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free . Where I have been critical of the Administration s policy , and where I criticized Nixon , was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955 , he praised the competence and stability of the bicta bict Batista dictatorship that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years . Secondly , I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections . What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections , particularly in 1957 and 1958 . Thirdly , Arthur Gardner , a Republican Ambassador , Earl Smith , a Republican Ambassador , in succession both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist , that Raul Castro was a Communist , and that they got no effective results . Instead our aid continued to Batista , which was ineffective we never were on the side of freedom we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively and today Cuba is lost for freedom . I hope some day it will rise but I do not think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years , and in fact towards all of Latin America when we have almost ignored the needs of Latin America we have beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years , except for the three months of the Hungarian uh revolution . Morgan , I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets . In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh by Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions . Lodge , on Meet the Press a month ago , said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U 2 incident . The U 2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security . But they were not in accordance with international law . And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told , rather than indicate that the flights would continue in fact , I believe Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets , if that would have saved the summit , and if the summit is useful and I believe it is . The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter that we expressed regrets the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958 . We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration . The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident . The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956 . That is the accepted procedure between nations and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt Be strong maintain a strong position but also speak softly . I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret , if that would have kept the summit going , in my judgment it was a proper action . It is not appeasement . It is not soft . I believe we should be stronger than we now are . I believe we should have a stronger military force . I believe we should increase our strength all over the world . But I do not confuse words with strength and in my judgment if the summit was useful , if it would have brought us closer to peace , that rather than the lie that we told which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on . Well , Nixon has not discussed the two basic questions what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954 Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question . Secondly , what is he going to do to provide fair employment He is been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that is carried out two cases , both in the District of Columbia . He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country , so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color . Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three , which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights . These are the great questions equality of education in school . About two percent of our population of white people are is illiterate , ten per cent of our colored population . Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school . These are the questions in these areas that the North and South , East and West are entitled to know . What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment Equality of opportunity in the field of housing , which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president s pen . What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership . And I can assure you that if I am elected president we will do so . Of course Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense . Nineteen fifty three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses . I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces . The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago . Secondly , on the question of our position in the United Nations . We all know about the vote held this week of the five neutralists and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States . Thirdly , in 1952 , there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations . Last year there were twenty nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it . We have not maintained our position and our prestige . A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the in eight out of nine countries they asked the people , who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically , and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970 . Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been . The Rockefeller Brothers report , General Ridgway , General Gavin , the Gaither Report , various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p United States both militarily , politically , psychologically , and scientifically and industrially the relative strength of the so of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it , and the American people should be told the facts . Yes . We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months . The program that was put forward this summer , after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba , really was done because we wanted to get through the A . meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba . And therefore we passed an authorization not an aid bill which was the first time , really , since the Inter American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed , that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America that we have associated ourselves with those people . Secondly , I believe that in the ca that it is far better for the United States , instead of concentrating our aid , particularly in the underdeveloped world , on surplus military equipment we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos . We paid more military aid , more aid into Laos po per per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists . I believe instead of doing that , we should concentrate our aid in long term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency . This permits them to maintain their self respect . It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth . And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be . I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund . And Senator Fulbright , Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that . We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years , on a long term loan basis , which this Administration opposed . And unless we are ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties , this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost . And if India should lose her battle , with thirty five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders , then I believe that the balance of power could move against us . I think the United States can afford to do these things . I think that we could not afford not to do these things . This goes to our survival . And here in a country which if it is moving ahead , if it is developing its economy to the fullest which we are not now in my judgment , we will have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas . I believe it is essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another towards us or towards the Communists and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti Communist fight , but also with the fight against poverty and hunger , these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example . I believe we can do it . If we build our economy the way we should , we can afford to do these things and we must do it . Well Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill . I am very familiar with it . It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman the labor subcommittee in fifty five . I was the floor manager . We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested , on two occasions , and the President vetoed it both times . We passed a bill again this year in the cong in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives . Let me make it very clear that the bill that Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes Barre or Scranton it did not mention West Virginia . Our bill was far more effective . The bill introduced and erd sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas . Secondly , he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens . I cannot still understand why this Administration and Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security . Third , I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we are able to get the people back to work . Five cents a day that is what the food package averages per person . Fourthly , I believe we should not carry out a hard money , high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958 , and I think helped bring the slow down of 1960 . If we move into a recession in sixty one , then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy , and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed . One is by ex the programs such as aid to education . The other would be to make a judgment on what is the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy . Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh propaganda that I have read . The question is what we are going to do in the future . I have been critical of this Administration and I have been critical of the President . In fact uh Nixon uh discussed that a week ago in a speech . I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined . Now what is the issue is what we are going to do in the future . Now that is an issue between Nixon and myself . He feels that we are moving ahead uh in a we are not going into a recession in this country , economically he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists , that we are moving ahead . I disagree . And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster , whether what we are doing now is not satisfactory , whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Nixon s view . That is the great issue . President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years . And that is the debate . That is the argument between Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it is a important judgment . I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932 , or certainly almost any in this century . Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States , and if his view prevails then I think that is going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties . If our view prevails that we have to do more , that we have to make a greater national and international effort , that we have lost prestige in Latin America the President of Brazil the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America . In Africa , the United States has ignored Latin uh Africa . We gave more scholarships to the Congo this summer we offered them than we have given to all of Africa the year before . Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything . We have been uh having a very clear decision in the last eight years . Nixon has been part of that Administration . He is had experience in it . And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years , that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining , that we are facing a very hazardous time in the sixties , and unless the United States begin to move here unless we start to go ahead I do not believe that we are going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom . I think the choice is clear and it involves the future . I have no disagreement with the Vice President s position on that . It my view is the same as his . Let me say there is only one uh point I would add . That before we go into the summit , before we ever meet again , I think it is important that the United States build its strength that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength . If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us , it is extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions . Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin , our commitment to Berlin . It is going to be a test of our nerve and will . It is going to be a test of our strength . And because we are going to move in sixty one and two , partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years , I believe that before we meet that crisis , that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength , because come spring or late in the winter we are going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty . On the question of the summit , I agree with the position of Nixon . I would not meet Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level foreign ministers or ambassadors which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success , or a useful exchange of ideas . That is right . Well I do not think that in the winter of sixty one under present economic conditions , it uh a uh tax uh increase would be desirable . In fact , it would be deflationary it would cause great unemployment it would cause a real slowdown in our economy . If it ever becomes necessary , and is wise economically and essential to our security , I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States . I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen sixties and that we are going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens . I am talking about a national mood . I am talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe . We do not know what the future s going to bring . But I would not want anyone to elect me uh president of the United States or vote for me under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected . Now , many of the programs that I am talking about economic growth , care for the aged , development of our natural resources build the strength of the United States . That is how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post war period . If we are moving ahead , if we are providing a viable economy , if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce then this country s on the move , then we are stronger , then we set a better example to the world . So we have the problem of not only building our own uh military strength and extending uh our policies abroad , we have to do a job here at home . So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States . We are using our steel capacity fifty five per cent today . We are not able to consume what we are able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains . And all I say is , I do not know what the sixties will bring except I think they will bring hard times in the uh international sphere I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States I am confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States . And I merely say that they if they elect me president , I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy , soft life . I think it is going to be difficult but I am confident that this country can meet its responsibilities . Well , Nixon uh I will just give you the testimony of George Aiken Senator George Aiken , the ranking minority member Republican member and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 said there were twenty six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet . Benson , testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957 , said there were twenty five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low cost diet . And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat . Now I have seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh not adequately fed . You cannot tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po per person and that n nearly six million Americans receiving that is adequate . You cannot tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States and there are twenty five million of them according to Benson is well fed or adequately fed . I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food . And they are not getting in many cases adequate shelter . And we ought to try to meet the problem . Secondly , Nixon has continued to state and he stated it last week these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c uh platform would cost . They are wholly inaccurate . I said last week I believed in a balanced budget . Unless there was a severe recession and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958 , twelve billion dollars larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States . So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession . Well , the United States uh has on occasion attempted uh mostly in the middle fifties , to persuade Chiang Kai shek to pull his troops back to Formosa . I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa . These islands are a few miles five or six miles off the coast of Red China , within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa . We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it is attacked . We say we will defend it if it is part of a general attack on Formosa . But it is extremely difficult to make that judgment . Now , Herter in 1958 , when he was Under Secretary of State , said they were strategically undefensible . Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands , in their conference in the Far East . General Ridgway has said the same thing . I believe that when you get into a w if you are going to get into war for the defense of Formosa , it ought to be on a clearly defined line . One of the problems , I think , at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked . I believe that we should defend Formosa . We should come to its defense . To leave this rather in the air , that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other , I think is a mistake . Secondly , I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun . It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa . It leaves a hundred miles between the sea . But with General Ridgway , Herter , General Collins , Admiral Spruance and many others , I think it is unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible , which are not , according to their testimony , essential to the defense of Formosa . I think that uh we should protect our commitments . I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin . I believe strongly we should d do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we have guaranteed . But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa . And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa , it is been my judgment ever since 1954 , at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East , that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself . Well , let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man . Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something . The Democratic party in this century has stood for something . It has stood for progress it has stood for concern for the people s welfare . It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense , and as a result , produced Wilson , President Roosevelt , and President Truman . The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding , Coolidge , Dewey , and Landon . They do stand for something . They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad . That is the importance of party only if it tells something about the record . And the Republicans in recent years not only in the last twenty five years , but in the last eight years have opposed housing , opposed care for the aged , opposed federal aid to education , opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something .<speech_sep>Good evening , Shadel . McGee , we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War IThat has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States it is been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATI have stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin . It is a commitment that we have to meet if we are going to protect the security of Western Europe . And therefore on this question I do not think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin I am sure there is not any doubt in the mind of the Russians . We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin . Yes . The whole th the United States now has a treaty which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island . The islands which Nixon is discussing are five or four miles , respectively , off the coast of China . Now when Senator Green , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , wrote to the President , he received back on the second of October , 1958 neither you nor any other American need feel the will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu . Now , that is the issue . I believe we must meet our commitment to uh Formosa . I support it and the Pescadores Island . That is the present American position . The treaty does not include these two islands . Nixon suggests uh that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked . I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores , or if there is any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores , then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty . Now , I must say what Nixon wants to do is commit us as I understand him , so that we can be clear if there is a disagreement he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory , not as part of the defense of Formosa . Admiral Yarnell , the commander of the Asiatic fleet , has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American . The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area . They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty five . We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them . This is a serious issue , and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree , and if so , where . Well I think we should st strengthen our conventional forces , and we should attempt in January , February , and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces . Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production , particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris . It may be a long period , but we must we must get started immediately . Now on the question of disarmament , particularly nuclear disarmament , I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961 , to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it is possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere , and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity . There are indications , because of new inventions , that ten , fifteen , or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity including Red China by the end of the presidential office in 1964 . This is extremely serious . There have been many wars in the history of mankind . And to take a chance uh now be and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons , I think would be a great mistake . One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I do not feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject , not only of nuclear controls , but also of general disarmament . Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject , and I believe it is been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva . Now , we may not succeed . The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system . We may be able to get satisfactory assurances . It may be necessary for us to begin testing again . But I hope the next Administration and if I have anything to do with it , the next Administration will make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing , control of nuclear weapons , if possible , control of outer space , free from weapons , and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels . These must be done . If we cannot succeed , then we must strengthen ourselves . But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization , but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war . I do not think it is possible for Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did . In 1955 , Dulles at a press conference said The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area . That was done with much thought and deliberation . Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores , and to deal with acts against that treaty area . I completely sustained the treaty . I voted for it . I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty , Formosa , and the Pescadores Island . What we are now talking about is the Vice President s determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu , which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China , which are not within the treaty area . I do not suggest that Chiang Kai shek and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai shek to lessen his troop commitments . Uh He sent a mission the President in 1955 of uh Robertson and Admiral Radford . General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959 . General Ridgway said who was Chief of Staff To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take . To me that concept is completely repugnant . So I stand with them . I stand with the Secretary of State , Herter , who said these islands were indefensible . I believe that we should meet our commitments , and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa , they know that it will mean a war . I would not ho hand over these islands under any point of gun . But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty . Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re Republic of China when he is never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba , ninety miles off the coast of the United States . Well , I must say that uh Truman has uh his methods of expressing things he is been in politics for fifty years he is been president of the United States . They may are not my style . But I really do not think there is anything that I could say to President Truman that is going to cause him , at the age of seventy six , to change his particular speaking manner . Perhaps Truman can , but I do not think I can . I will just have to tell Morton that . If you had pass that message on to him . Well number one on Indochina , Nixon talked in before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting , and I quote him , American boys into Indochina . The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina . Number two , on the question of the U 2 flights . I thought the . U 2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved , if the summit conference had any hope for success . I never criticized the U 2 flights in general , however . I never suggested espionage should stop . It still goes on , I would assume , on both sides . Number three , the Vice President on May fifteenth after the U 2 flight indicated that the flights were going on , even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth . Number three , the pre Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu . That is not the position he is taking . He is indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are , in his words , in the area of freedom . He did not take that position on Tibet . He did not take that position on Budapest . He does not take that position that I have seen so far in Laos . Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy so has Cuba . I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que to uh Formosa and the Pescadores . But as Admiral Yarnell has said , and he is been supported by most military authority , these islands that we are now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment . And therefore , I think , we should make it very clear the disagreement between Nixon and myself . He is extending the Administration s commitment . Well the que the Griffin , I believe , who is the head of the Klan , who lives in Tampa , Florida , indicated a in a statement , I think , two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me , and that he was going to vote for Nixon . I do not suggest in any way , nor have I ever , that that indicates that Nixon has the slightest sympathy , involvement , or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan . That is absurd . I do not suggest that , I do not support it . I would disagree with it . Nixon knows very well that in this in this whole matter that is been involved with the so called religious discussion in this campaign , I have never suggested , even by the vaguest implication , that he did anything but disapprove it . And that is my view now . I disapprove of the issue . I do not suggest that Nixon does in any way . Well , I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they are stated by the Vice President . I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes . I am opposed to that , was opposed to it in October , 1958 . I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft Hartley Act . I do not know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about . I am talking about giving him four or five tools not only the fact finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision , not only the injunction , but also the power of the fact finding commission to make recommendations recommendations which would not be binding , but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them . One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure . There might be others . By the president having five powers four or five powers and he only has very limited powers today , neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used and therefore , there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government . The difficulty now is the president s course is quite limited . He can set up a fact finding committee . The fact finding committee s powers are limited . He can provide an injunction if there is a national emergency for eighty days , then the strike can go on and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress . This is a difficult and sensitive matter . But to state my view precisely , the president should have a variety of things he could do . He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use and therefore there would be incentive , instead of as now the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union , which did not happen . Yes , I have stated in both uh debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress . The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession and we had that in fifty eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense , which we had in World War II and uh during part of the Korean War . On the question of the cost of our budget , I have stated that it is my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half , possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program . My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward , which is an extension of Benson s program , will cost a billion dollars more than the present program , which costs about six billion dollars a year , the most expensive in history . We have spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that . Secondly , I believe that the high interest rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt merely funding the debt which is a burden an the taxpayers . I would hope , under a different monetary policy , that it would be possible to reduce that interest rate burden , at least a billion dollars . Third , I think it is possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof loopholes on dividend withholding , on expense accounts . Fourthly , I have suggested that the medical care for the aged and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security which would be financed under the Social Security taxes which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care , doctors bills , nurses , hospitals , when they retire . It is actuarially sound . So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education , we had spend more money on housing , we had spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has . But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget , and that would be my intention . Nixon misstates my figures constantly , which uh is of course his right , but the fact of the matter is here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record . Well first may I correct a statement which was made before , that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty five percent . That is untrue . The fa the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty five cent loaf of bread . Even if you put his income up ten percent , that would be two and three quarters percent three pers or three cents out of that twenty five cents . The t man who grows tomatoes it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can . And I believe when the average hour for many farmers wage is about fifty cents an hour , he should do better . But anybody who suggests that that program would c come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error . The Vice President suggested a number of things . He suggested that we aid distressed areas . The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice . He suggested we pass an aid to education bill . But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education . And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers salaries in the Senate , which prevented that being added . This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth which means jobs of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959 . And when we have to find twenty five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years , we are going to have to grow more . Governor Rockefeller says five per cent . The Democratic platform and others say five per cent . Many say four and a half per cent . The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent . That is why we do not have full employment today . Uh McGee , there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance different kind of minerals , including oil . I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay . That includes oil it includes all kinds of minerals it includes everything within the range of taxation . We want to be sure it is fair and equitable . It includes oil abroad . Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home . Now the oil industry recently has had hard times . Particularly some of the smaller producers . They are moving about eight or nine days in Texas . But I can assure you that if I am elected president , the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully . And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity , then I would vote to close that loophole , I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers for those from five million dollars down , to maintain it at twenty seven and a half per cent . I believe we should study this and other allowances tax expense , dividend expenses and all the rest , and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward . Just to uh correct the record , Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine . What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there are not loopholes . If his record is the opposite of that , that means that he does not want to go into it . Now on the question of gold . The difficulty , of course , is that we do have heavy obligations abroad , that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops , maintain our bases , and sustain other economies . In other words , if we are going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties , we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy . We have to have control over inflation , and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade . We have to be able to compete in the world market . We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh from abroad if we are going to be able to meet our obligations . In addition , many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads , going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage . Now there is not a dollar shortage , and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods . I believe that we must be able to compete in the market steel and in all the basic commodities abroad we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead . We have to be sure to maintain that . We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in , not to act as if there was a dollar gap and third , we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we have maintained , to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa , Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own . Well , I think there are many uh tests , Drummond , of prestige . And the significance of prestige , really , is because we are so identified with the cause of freedom . Therefore , if we are on the mount , if we are rising , if our influence is spreading , if our prestige is spreading , then those uh who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system , wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism , they will be persuaded to follow our example . There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was . George Allen , the head of our information service , said that a result of our being second in space , in the sputnik in 1957 , and I quote him , I believe I paraphrase him accurately . He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement . And therefore , he said , many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union , which was once so backward , is now on a par with the United States . Secondly , the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours . Dulles has suggested it is from two to three times as great as ours . This has a great effect on the s underdeveloped world , which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources . Three , a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970 , both scientifically and militarily . And a majority in every country except Greece , felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970 . Four , in the votes at the N . , particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday , we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries one , Liberia , which had been tied to us for more than a century , and the other , Union of South Africa , which is not a popular country in Africa . Every other ca African country either abstained or voted against us . A More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us . On the neutralists resolution , which we were so much opposed to , the same thing happened . The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil , took a trip to Cuba to call on Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh within Brazil . There are many indications . Guinea and Ghana , two independent countries within the last three years Guinea in fifty seven , Ghana within the last eighteen months both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the Herter said so himself . Laos is moving in that direction . So I would say our prestige is not so high . No longer do we give the image of being on the rise . No longer do we give an image of vitality .<speech_sep>Good evening , my fellow citizens I speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope . Eighteen years ago the advent of nuclear weapons changed the course of the world as well as the war . Since that time , all mankind has been struggling to escape from the darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth . In an age when both sides have come to possess enough nuclear power to destroy the human race several times over , the world of communism and the world of free choice have been caught up in a vicious circle of conflicting ideology and interest . Each increase of tension has produced an increase of arms each increase of arms has produced an increase of tension . In these years , the United States and the Soviet Union have frequently communicated suspicion and warnings to each other , but very rarely hope . Our representatives have met at the summit and at the brink they have met in Washington and in Moscow in Geneva and at the United Nations . But too often these meetings have produced only darkness , discord , or disillusion . Yesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness . Negotiations were concluded in Moscow on a treaty to ban all nuclear tests in the atmosphere , in outer space , and under water . For the first time , an agreement has been reached on bringing the forces of nuclear destruction under international control a goal first sought in 1946 when Bernard Baruch presented a comprehensive control plan to the United Nations . That plan , and many subsequent disarmament plans , large and small , have all been blocked by those opposed to international inspection . A ban on nuclear tests , however , requires on the spot inspection only for underground tests . This Nation now possesses a variety of techniques to detect the nuclear tests of other nations which are conducted in the air or under water , for such tests produce unmistakable signs which our modern instruments can pick up . The treaty initialed yesterday , therefore , is a limited treaty which permits continued underground testing and prohibits only those tests that we ourselves can police . It requires no control posts , no onsite inspection , no international body . We should also understand that it has other limits as well . Any nation which signs the treaty will have an opportunity to withdraw if it finds that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests and no nation s right of self defense will in any way be impaired . Nor does this treaty mean an end to the threat of nuclear war . It will not reduce nuclear stockpiles it will not halt the production of nuclear weapons it will not restrict their use in time of war . Nevertheless , this limited treaty will radically reduce the nuclear testing which would otherwise be conducted on both sides it will prohibit the United States , the United Kingdom , the Soviet Union , and all others who sign it , from engaging in the atmospheric tests which have so alarmed mankind and it offers to all the world a welcome sign of hope . For this is not a unilateral moratorium , but a specific and solemn legal obligation . While it will not prevent this Nation from testing underground , or from being ready to conduct atmospheric tests if the acts of others so require , it gives us a concrete opportunity to extend its coverage to other nations and later to other forms of nuclear tests . This treaty is in part the product of Western patience and vigilance . We have made clear most recently in Berlin and Cuba our deep resolve to protect our security and our freedom against any form of aggression . We have also made clear our steadfast determination to limit the arms race . In three administrations , our soldiers and diplomats have worked together to this end , always supported by Great Britain . Prime Minister Macmillan joined with President Eisenhower in proposing a limited test ban in 1959 , and again with me in 1961 and 1962 . But the achievement of this goal is not a victory for one side it is a victory for mankind . It reflects no concessions either to or by the Soviet Union . It reflects simply our common recognition of the dangers in further testing . This treaty is not the millennium . It will not resolve all conflicts , or cause the Communists to forego their ambitions , or eliminate the dangers of war . It will not reduce our need for arms or allies or programs of assistance to others . But it is an important first step a step towards peace a step towards reason a step away from war . Here is what this step can mean to you and to your children and your neighbors First , this treaty can be a step towards reduced world tension and broader areas of agreement . The Moscow talks have reached no agreement on any other subject , nor is this treaty conditioned on any other matter . Under Secretary Harriman made it clear that any nonaggression arrangements across the division in Europe would require full consultation with our allies and full attention to their interests . He also made clear our strong preference for a more comprehensive treaty banning all tests everywhere , and our ultimate hope for general and complete disarmament . The Soviet Government , however , is still unwilling to accept the inspection such goals require . No one can predict with certainty , therefore , what further agreements , if any , can be built on the foundations of this one . They could include controls on preparations for surprise attack , or on numbers and type of armaments . There could be further limitations on the spread of nuclear weapons . The important point is that efforts to seek new agreements will go forward . But the difficulty of predicting the next step is no reason to be reluctant about this step . Nuclear test ban negotiations have long been a symbol of East West disagreement . If this treaty can also be a symbol if it can symbolize the end of one era and the beginning of another if both sides can by this treaty gain confidence and experience in peaceful collaboration then this short and simple treaty may well become an historic mark in man s age old pursuit of peace . Western policies have long been designed to persuade the Soviet Union to renounce aggression , direct or indirect , so that their people and all people may live and let live in peace . The unlimited testing of new weapons of war cannot lead towards that end but this treaty , if it can be followed by further progress , can clearly move in that direction . I do not say that a world without aggression or threats of war would be an easy world . It will bring new problems , new challenges from the Communists , new dangers of relaxing our vigilance or of mistaking their intent . But those dangers pale in comparison to those of the spiraling arms race and a collision course towards war . Since the beginning of history , war has been mankind s constant companion . It has been the rule , not the exception . Even a nation as young and as peace loving as our own has fought through eight wars . And three times in the last two years and a half I have been required to report to you as President that this Nation and the Soviet Union stood on the verge of direct military confrontation in Laos , in Berlin , and in Cuba . A war today or tomorrow , if it led to nuclear war , would not be like any war in history . A full scale nuclear exchange , lasting less than 60 minutes , with the weapons now in existence , could wipe out more than 300 million Americans , Europeans , and Russians , as well as untold numbers elsewhere . And the survivors , as Chairman Khrushchev warned the Communist Chinese , the survivors would envy the dead . For they would inherit a world so devastated by explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot even conceive of its horrors . So let us try to turn the world away from war . Let us make the most of this opportunity , and every opportunity , to reduce tension , to slow down the perilous nuclear arms race , and to check the world s slide toward final annihilation . Second , this treaty can be a step towards freeing the world from the fears and dangers of radioactive fallout . Our own atmospheric tests last year were conducted under conditions which restricted such fallout to an absolute minimum . But over the years the number and the yield of weapons tested have rapidly increased and so have the radioactive hazards from such testing . Continued unrestricted testing by the nuclear powers , joined in time by other nations which may be less adept in limiting pollution , will increasingly contaminate the air that all of us must breathe . Even then , the number of children and grandchildren with cancer in their bones , with leukemia in their blood , or with poison in their lungs might seem statistically small to some , in comparison with natural health hazards . But this is not a natural health hazard and it is not a statistical issue . The loss of even one human life , or the malformation of even one baby who may be born long after we are gone should be of concern to us all . Our children and grandchildren are not merely statistics toward which we can be indifferent . Nor does this affect the nuclear powers alone . These tests befoul the air of all men and all nations , the committed and the uncommitted alike , without their knowledge and without their consent . That is why the continuation of atmospheric testing causes so many countries to regard all nuclear powers as equally evil and we can hope that its prevention will enable those countries to see the world more clearly , while enabling all the world to breathe more easily . Third , this treaty can be a step toward preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them . During the next several years , in addition to the four current nuclear powers , a small but significant number of nations will have the intellectual , physical , and financial resources to produce both nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them . In time , it is estimated , many other nations will have either this capacity or other ways of obtaining nuclear warheads , even as missiles can be commercially purchased today . I ask you to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands , in the hands of countries large and small , stable and unstable , responsible and irresponsible , scattered throughout the world . There would be no rest for anyone then , no stability , no real security , and no chance of effective disarmament . There would only be the increased chance of accidental war , and an increased necessity for the great powers to involve themselves in what otherwise would be local conflicts . If only one thermonuclear bomb were to be dropped on any American , Russian , or any other city , whether it was launched by accident or design , by a madman or by an enemy , by a large nation or by a small , from any corner of the world , that one bomb could release more destructive power on the inhabitants of that one helpless city than all the bombs dropped in the Second World War . Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union nor the United Kingdom nor France can look forward to that day with equanimity . We have a great obligation , all four nuclear powers have a great obligation , to use whatever time remains to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , to persuade other countries not to test , transfer , acquire , possess , or produce such weapons . This treaty can be the opening wedge in that campaign . It provides that none of the parties will assist other nations to test in the forbidden environments . It opens the door for further agreements on the control of nuclear weapons , and it is open for all nations to sign , for it is in the interest of all nations , and already we have heard from a number of countries who wish to join with us promptly . Fourth and finally , this treaty can limit the nuclear arms race in ways which , on balance , will strengthen our Nation s security far more than the continuation of unrestricted testing . For in today s world , a nation s security does not always increase as its arms increase , when its adversary is doing the same , and unlimited competition in the testing and development of new types of destructive nuclear weapons will not make the world safer for either side . Under this limited treaty , on the other hand , the testing of other nations could never be sufficient to offset the ability of our strategic forces to deter or survive a nuclear attack and to penetrate and destroy an aggressor s homeland . We have , and under this treaty we will continue to have , the nuclear strength that we need . It is true that the Soviets have tested nuclear weapons of a yield higher than that which we thought to be necessary , but the hundred megaton bomb of which they spoke 2 years ago does not and will not change the balance of strategic power . The United States has chosen , deliberately , to concentrate on more mobile and more efficient weapons , with lower but entirely sufficient yield , and our security is , therefore , not impaired by the treaty I am discussing . It is also true , as Khrushchev would agree , that nations cannot afford in these matters to rely simply on the good faith of their adversaries . We have not , therefore , overlooked the risk of secret violations . There is at present a possibility that deep in outer space , that hundreds and thousands and millions of miles away from the earth illegal tests might go undetected . But we already have the capability to construct a system of observation that would make such tests almost impossible to conceal , and we can decide at any time whether such a system is needed in the light of the limited risk to us and the limited reward to others of violations attempted at that range . For any tests which might be conducted so far out in space , which cannot be conducted more easily and efficiently and legally underground , would necessarily be of such a magnitude that they would be extremely difficult to conceal . We can also employ new devices to check on the testing of smaller weapons in the lower atmosphere . Any violations , moreover , involves , along with the risk of detection , the end of the treaty and the worldwide consequences for the violator . Secret violations are possible and secret preparations for a sudden withdrawal are possible , and thus our own vigilance and strength must be maintained , as we remain ready to withdraw and to resume all forms of testing , if we must . But it would be a mistake to assume that this treaty will be quickly broken . The gains of illegal testing are obviously slight compared to their cost , and the hazard of discovery , and the nations which have initialed and will sign this treaty prefer it , in my judgment , to unrestricted testing as a matter of their own self interests for these nations , too , and all nations , have a stake in limiting the arms race , in holding the spread of nuclear weapons , and in breathing air that is not radioactive . While it may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the risks inherent in any treaty , and such risks in this treaty are small , the far greater risks to our security are the risks of unrestricted testing , the risk of a nuclear arms race , the risk of new nuclear powers , nuclear pollution , and nuclear war . This limited test ban , in our most careful judgment , is safer by far for the United States than an unlimited nuclear arms race . For all these reasons , I am hopeful that this Nation will promptly approve the limited test ban treaty . There will , of course , be debate in the country and in the Senate . The Constitution wisely requires the advice and consent of the Senate to all treaties , and that consultation has already begun . All this is as it should be . A document which may mark an historic and constructive opportunity for the world deserves an historic and constructive debate . It is my hope that all of you will take part in that debate , for this treaty is for all of us . It is particularly for our children and our grandchildren , and they have no lobby here in Washington . This debate will involve military , scientific , and political experts , but it must be not left to them alone . The right and the responsibility are yours . If we are to open new doorways to peace , if we are to seize this rare opportunity for progress , if we are to be as bold and farsighted in our control of weapons as we have been in their invention , then let us now show all the world on this side of the wall and the other that a strong America also stands for peace . There is no cause for complacency . We have learned in times past that the spirit of one moment or place can be gone in the next . We have been disappointed more than once , and we have no illusions now that there are shortcuts on the road to peace . At many points around the globe the Communists are continuing their efforts to exploit weakness and poverty . Their concentration of nuclear and conventional arms must still be deterred . The familiar contest between choice and coercion , the familiar places of danger and conflict , are all still there , in Cuba , in Southeast Asia , in Berlin , and all around the globe , still requiring all the strength and the vigilance that we can muster . Nothing could more greatly damage our cause than if we and our allies were to believe that peace has already been achieved , and that our strength and unity were no longer required . But now , for the first time in many years , the path of peace may be open . No one can be certain what the future will bring . No one can say whether the time has come for an easing of the struggle . But history and our own conscience will judge us harsher if we do not now make every effort to test our hopes by action , and this is the place to begin . According to the ancient Chinese proverb , A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step . My fellow Americans , let us take that first step . Let us , if we can , step back from the shadows of war and seek out the way of peace . And if that journey is a thousand miles , or even more , let history record that we , in this land , at this time , took the first step . Thank you and good night .<speech_sep>It is a great pleasure for Kennedy and for me , for the Vice President and Johnson , and for the Members of Congress , to welcome the Ambassadorial Corps of our Hemisphere , our long time friends , to the White House today . One hundred and thirty nine years ago this week the United States , stirred by the heroic struggle of its fellow Americans , urged the independence and recognition of the new Latin American Republics . It was then , at the dawn of freedom throughout this hemisphere , that Bolivar spoke of his desire to see the Americas fashioned into the greatest region in the world , greatest , he said , not so much by virtue of her area and her wealth , as by her freedom and her glory . Never in the long history of our hemisphere has this dream been nearer to fulfillment , and never has it been in greater danger . The genius of our scientists has given us the tools to bring abundance to our land , strength to our industry , and knowledge to our people . For the first time we have the capacity to strike off the remaining bonds of poverty and ignorance to free our people for the spiritual and intellectual fulfillment which has always been the goal of our civilization . Yet at this very moment of maximum opportunity , we confront the same forces which have imperiled America throughout its history the alien forces which once again seek to impose the despotisms of the Old World on the people of the New . I have asked you to come here today so that I might discuss these challenges and these dangers . We meet together as firm and ancient friends , united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of American civilization . For this New World of ours is not a mere accident of geography . Our continents are bound together by a common history , the endless exploration of new frontiers . Our nations are the product of a common struggle , the revolt from colonial rule . And our people share a common heritage , the quest for the dignity and the freedom of man . The revolutions which gave us birth ignited , in the words of Thomas Paine , a spark never to be extinguished . And across vast , turbulent continents these American ideals still stir man s struggle for national independence and individual freedom . But as we welcome the spread of the American revolution to other lands , we must also remember that our own struggle the revolution which began in Philadelphia in 1776 , and in Caracas in 1811 is not yet finished . Our hemisphere s mission is not yet completed . For our unfulfilled task is to demonstrate to the entire world that man s unsatisfied aspiration for economic progress and social justice can best be achieved by free men working within a framework of democratic institutions . If we can do this in our own hemisphere , and for our own people , we may yet realize the prophecy of the great Mexican patriot , Benito Juarez , that democracy is the destiny of future humanity . As a citizen of the United States let me be the first to admit that we North Americans have not always grasped the significance of this common mission , just as it is also true that many in your own countries have not fully understood the urgency of the need to lift people from poverty and ignorance and despair . But we must turn from these mistakes from the failures and the misunderstandings of the past to a future full of peril , but bright with hope . Throughout Latin America , a continent rich in resources and in the spiritual and cultural achievements of its people , millions of men and women suffer the daily degradations of poverty and hunger . They lack decent shelter or protection from disease . Their children are deprived of the education or the jobs which are the gateway to a better life . And each day the problems grow more urgent . Population growth is outpacing economic growth low living standards are further endangered and discontent the discontent of a people who know that abundance and the tools of progress are at last within their reach that discontent is growing . In the words of Jose Figueres , once dormant peoples are struggling upward toward the sun , toward a better life . If we are to meet a problem so staggering in its dimensions , our approach must itself be equally bold an approach consistent with the majestic concept of Operation Pan America . Therefore I have called on all people of the hemisphere to join in a new Alliance for Progress Alianza para Progreso a vast cooperative effort , unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose , to satisfy the basic needs of the American people for homes , work and land , health and schools techo , trabajo y tierra , salud y escuela , First , I propose that the American Republics begin on a vast new Ten Year Plan for the Americas , a plan to transform the 1960 s into a historic decade of democratic progress . These 10 years will be the years of maximum progress maximum effort , the years when the greatest obstacles must be overcome , the years when the need for assistance will be the greatest . And if we are successful , if our effort is bold enough and determined enough , then the close of this decade will mark the beginning of a new era in the American experience . The living standards of every American family will be on the rise , basic education will be available to all , hunger will be a forgotten experience , the need for massive outside help will have passed , most nations will have entered a period of self sustaining growth , and though there will be still much to do , every American Republic will be the master of its own revolution and its own hope and progress . Let me stress that only the most determined efforts of the American nations themselves can bring success to this effort . They , and they alone , can mobilize their resources , enlist the energies of their people , and modify their social patterns so that all , and not just a privileged few , share in the fruits of growth . If this effort is made , then outside assistance will give vital impetus to progress without it , no amount of help will advance the welfare of the people . Thus if the countries of Latin America are ready to do their part , and I am sure they are , then I believe the United States , for its part , should help provide resources of a scope and magnitude sufficient to make this bold development plan a success just as we helped to provide , against equal odds nearly , the resources adequate to help rebuild the economies of Western Europe . For only an effort of towering dimensions can ensure fulfillment of our plan for a decade of progress . Secondly , I will shortly request a ministerial meeting of the Inter American Economic and Social Council , a meeting at which we can begin the massive planning effort which will be at the heart of the Alliance for Progress . For if our Alliance is to succeed , each Latin nation must formulate long range plans for its own development , plans which establish targets and priorities , ensure monetary stability , establish the machinery for vital social change , stimulate private activity and initiative , and provide for a maximum national effort . These plans will be the foundation of our development effort , and the basis for the allocation of outside resources . A greatly strengthened IA ECOSOworking with the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Inter American Development Bank , can assemble the leading economists and experts of the hemisphere to help each country develop its own development plan and provide a continuing review of economic progress in this hemisphere . Third , I have this evening signed a request to the Congress for 500 million as a first step in fulfilling the Act of Bogota . This is the first large scale Inter American effort , instituted by my predecessor President Eisenhower , to attack the social barriers which block economic progress . The money will be used to combat illiteracy , improve the productivity and use of their land , wipe out disease , attack archaic tax and land tenure structures , provide educational opportunities , and offer a broad range of projects designed to make the benefits of increasing abundance available to all . We will begin to commit these funds as soon as they are appropriated . Fourth , we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity . The fragmentation of Latin American economies is a serious barrier to industrial growth . Projects such as the Central American common market and free trade areas in South America can help to remove these obstacles . Fifth , the United States is ready to cooperate in serious , case by case examinations of commodity market problems . Frequent violent change in commodity prices seriously injure the economies of many Latin American countries , draining their resources and stultifying their growth . Together we must find practical methods of bringing an end to this pattern . Sixth , we will immediately step up our Food for Peace emergency program , help establish food reserves in areas of recurrent drought , help provide school lunches for children , and offer feed grains for use in rural development . For hungry men and women cannot wait for economic discussions or diplomatic meetings their need is urgent and their hunger rests heavily on the conscience of their fellow men . Seventh , all the people of the hemisphere must be allowed to share in the expanding wonders of science wonders which have captured man s imagination , challenged the powers of his mind , and given him the tools for rapid progress . I invite Latin American scientists to work with us in new projects in fields such as medicine and agriculture , physics and astronomy , and desalinization , to help plan for regional research laboratories in these and other fields , and to strengthen cooperation between American universities and laboratories . We also intend to expand our science teacher training programs to include Latin American instructors , to assist in establishing such programs in other American countries , and translate and make available revolutionary new teaching materials in physics , chemistry , biology , and mathematics , so that the young of all nations may contribute their skills to the advance of science . Eighth , we must rapidly expand the training of those needed to man the economies of rapidly developing countries . This means expanded technical training programs , for which the Peace Corps , for example , will be available when needed . It also means assistance to Latin American universities , graduate schools , and research institutes . We welcome proposals in Central America for intimate cooperation in higher education cooperation which can achieve a regional effort of increased effectiveness and excellence . We are ready to help fill the gap in trained manpower , realizing that our ultimate goal must be a basic education for all who wish to learn . Ninth , we reaffirm our pledge to come to the defense of any American nation whose independence is endangered . As its confidence in the collective security system of the OAS spreads , it will be possible to devote to constructive use a major share of those resources now spent on the instruments of war . Even now , as the government of Chile has said , the time has come to take the first steps toward sensible limitations of arms . And the new generation of military leaders has shown an increasing awareness that armies cannot only defend their countries they can , as we have learned through our own Corps of Engineers , they can help to build them . Tenth , we invite our friends in Latin America to contribute to the enrichment of life and culture in the United States . We need teachers of your literature and history and tradition , opportunities for our young people to study in your universities , access to your music , your art , and the thought of your great philosophers . For we know we have much to learn . In this way you can help bring a fuller spiritual and intellectual life to the people of the United States and contribute to understanding and mutual respect among the nations of the hemisphere . With steps such as these , we propose to complete the revolution of the Americas , to build a hemisphere where all men can hope for a suitable standard of living , and all can live out their lives in dignity and in freedom . To achieve this goal political freedom must accompany material progress . Our Alliance for Progress is an alliance of free governments , and it must work to eliminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place . Therefore let us express our special friendship to the people of Cuba and the Dominican Republic and the hope they will soon rejoin the society of free men , uniting with us in common effort . This political freedom must be accompanied by social change . For unless necessary social reforms , including land and tax reform , are freely made unless we broaden the opportunity for all of our people unless the great mass of Americans share in increasing prosperity then our alliance , our revolution , our dream , and our freedom will fail . But we call for social change by free men change in the spirit of Washington and Jefferson , of Bolivar and San Martin and Martin not change which seeks to impose on men tyrannies which we cast out a century and a half ago . Our motto is what it has always been progress yes , tyranny no progreso si , tirania no But our greatest challenge comes from within the task of creating an American civilization where spiritual and cultural values are strengthened by an ever broadening base of material advance where , within the rich diversity of its own traditions , each nation is free to follow its own path towards progress . The completion of our task will , of course , require the efforts of all governments of our hemisphere . But the efforts of governments alone will never be enough . In the end , the people must choose and the people must help themselves . And so I say to the men and women of the Americas to the campesino in the fields , to the obrero in the cities , to the estudiante in the schools prepare your mind and heart for the task ahead call forth your strength and let each devote his energies to the betterment of all , so that your children and our children in this hemisphere can find an ever richer and a freer life . Let us once again transform the American continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary ideas and efforts a tribute to the power of the creative energies of free men and women an example to all the world that liberty and progress walk hand in hand . Let us once again awaken our American revolution until it guides the struggle of people everywhere not with an imperialism of force or fear but the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future of man .<speech_sep>LADIEI want to express my great satisfaction in welcoming you to the White House . And also as a citizen not merely of the United States but also as an inhabitant of the globe in difficult times I want to express my appreciation to you and the appreciation of the people of this country for your efforts in the United Nations . I was present in 1945 at San Francisco , as a member of the press , at the time that the United Nations was born . I know that at different times in the last 15 or 16 years this organization has come under criticism in many countries I am sure all of yours , and my own here in the United States . But recalling what Robert Frost , one of our poets , once said , Do not take down the fence until you know why it was put up , I have a strong conviction that we should seek to strengthen the United Nations and make it the kind of instrument which all of us hope it will be . I do not think , really , in any sense , the United Nations has failed as a concept . I think occasionally we fail it . And the more that we can do to strengthen the idea of a community of the world , to seek to develop manners by which the tensions of the world and the problems of the world can be solved in an orderly and peaceful way , I think that is in the common interest of all . The United Nations has survived 16 difficult years . Countries once unknown have come into existence and are playing important parts in the United Nations . It has come to the present day and plays a most important part in the lives of all of us . So I congratulate you for the work that you have done . We want you to know that you are very welcome to this country . We are glad that you are seeing something however much we all admire New York , we are glad you are seeing something of the United States besides New York . And we hope that while you are visiting here you will come not only to Washington and New York , which in a sense are rather special parts of this country , but also go perhaps even to Boston and even further West . I want to thank you very much indeed . I want to say that I had not expected that the standard of revolt would be raised in the royal pavilion here , but I am always rather nervous about how you talk about women who are active in politics , whether they want to be talked about as women or as politicians , but I want you to know that we are grateful to have you as both today . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>The orders of the court in the case of Meredith versus Fair are beginning to be carried out . James Meredith is now in residence on the campus of the University of Mississippi . This has been accomplished thus far without the use of National Guard or other troops . And it is to be hoped that the law enforcement officers of the State of Mississippi and the Federal marshals will continue to be sufficient in the future . All students , members of the faculty , and public officials in both Mississippi and the Nation will be able , it is hoped , to return to their normal activities with full confidence in the integrity of American law . This is as it should be , for our Nation is founded on the principle that observance of the law is the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law is the surest road to tyranny . The law which we obey includes the final rulings of the courts , as well as the enactment s of our legislative bodies . Even among law abiding men few laws are universally loved , but they are uniformly respected and not resisted . Americans are free , in short , to disagree with the law but not to disobey it . For in a government of laws and not of men , no man , however prominent or powerful , and no mob , however unruly or boisterous , is entitled to defy a court of law . If this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of men by force or threat of force could long defy the commands of our court and our Constitution , then no law would stand free from doubt , no judge would be sure of his writ , and no citizen would be safe from his neighbors . In this case in which the United States Government was not until recently involved , Meredith brought a private suit in Federal court against those who were excluding him from the University . A series of Federal courts all the way to the Supreme Court repeatedly ordered Meredith s admission to the University . When those orders were defied , and those who sought to implement them threatened with arrest and violence , the United States Court of Appeals consisting of Chief Judge Tuttle of Georgia , Judge Hutcheson of Texas , Judge Rives of Alabama , Judge Jones of Florida , Judge Brown of Texas , Judge Wisdom of Louisiana , Judge Gewin of Alabama , and Judge Bell of Georgia , made clear the fact that the enforcement of its order had become an obligation of the United States Government . Even though this Government had not originally been a party to the case , my responsibility as President was therefore inescapable . I accept it . My obligation under the Constitution and the statutes of the United States was and is to implement the orders of the court with whatever means are necessary , and with as little force and civil disorder as the circumstances permit . It was for this reason that I federalized the Mississippi National Guard as the most appropriate instrument , should any be needed , to preserve law and order while United States marshals carried out the orders of the court and prepared to back them up with whatever other civil or military enforcement might have been required . I deeply regret the fact that any action by the executive branch was necessary in this case , but all other avenues and alternatives , including persuasion and conciliation , had been tried and exhausted . Had the police powers of Mississippi been used to support the orders of the court , instead of deliberately and unlawfully blocking them , had the University of Mississippi fulfilled its standard of excellence by quietly admitting this applicant in conformity with what so many other southern State universities have done for so many years , a peaceable and sensible solution would have been possible without any Federal intervention . This Nation is proud of the many instances in which Governors , educators , and everyday citizens from the South have shown to the world the gains that can be made by persuasion and good will in a society ruled by law . Specifically , I would like to take this occasion to express the thanks of this Nation to those southerners who have contributed to the progress of our democratic development in the entrance of students regardless of race to such great institutions as the State supported universities of Virginia , North Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Texas , Louisiana , Tennessee , Arkansas , and Kentucky . I recognize that the present period of transition and adjustment in our Nation s Southland is a hard one for many people . Neither Mississippi nor any other southern State deserves to be charged with all the accumulated wrongs of the last 100 years of race relations . To the extent that there has been failure , the responsibility for that failure must be shared by us all , by every State , by every citizen . Mississippi and her University , moreover , are noted for their courage , for their contribution of talent and thought to the affairs of this Nation . This is the State of Lucius Lamar and many others who have placed the national good ahead of sectional interest . This is the State which had four Medal of Honor winners in the Korean war alone . In fact , the Guard unit federalized this morning , early , is part of the 155th Infantry , one of the 10 oldest regiments in the Union and one of the most decorated for sacrifice and bravery in 6 wars . In 1945 a Mississippi sergeant , Jake Lindsey , was honored by an unusual joint session of the Congress . I close therefore with this appeal to the students of the University , the people who are most concerned . You have a great tradition to uphold , a tradition of honor and courage won on the field of battle and on the gridiron as well as the University campus . You have a new opportunity to show that you are men of patriotism and integrity . For the most effective means of upholding the law is not the State policeman or the marshals or the National Guard . It is you . It lies in your courage to accept those laws with which you disagree as well as those with which you agree . The eyes of the Nation and of all the world are upon you and upon all of us , and the honor of your University and State are in the balance . I am certain that the great majority of the students will uphold that honor . There is in short no reason why the books on this case cannot now be quickly and quietly closed in the manner directed by the court . Let us preserve both the law and the peace and then healing those wounds that are within we can turn to the greater crises that are without and stand united as one people in our pledge to man s freedom . Thank you and good night .<speech_sep>I am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished Mayor , who has symbolized throughout the world the fighting spirit of West Berlin . And I am proud to visit the Federal Republic with your distinguished Chancellor who for so many years has committed Germany to democracy and freedom and progress , and to come here in the company of my fellow American , General Clay , who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed . Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was civis Romanus sum . Today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner . I appreciate my interpreter translating my German There are many people in the world who really do not understand , or say they do not , what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world . Let them come to Berlin . There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future . Let them come to Berlin . And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists . Let them come to Berlin . And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system , but it permits us to make economic progress . Lass sic nach Berlin kommen . Let them come to Berlin . Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect , but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in , to prevent them from leaving us . I want to say , on behalf of my countrymen , who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic , who are far distant from you , that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you , even from a distance , the story of the last 18 years . I know of no town , no city , that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force , and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin . While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of . the Communist system , for all the world to see , we take no satisfaction in it , for it is , as your Mayor has said , an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity , separating families , dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters , and dividing a people who wish to be joined together . What is true of this city is true of Germany real , lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men , and that is to make a free choice . In 18 years of peace and good faith , this generation of Germans has earned the right to be free , including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace , with good will to all people . You live in a defended island of freedom , but your life is part of the main . So let me ask you , as I close , to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today , to the hopes of tomorrow , beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin , or your country of Germany , to the advance of freedom everywhere , beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice , beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind . Freedom is indivisible , and when one man is enslaved , all are not free . When all are free , then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe . When that day finally comes , as it will , the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades . All free men , wherever they may live , are citizens of Berlin , and , therefore , as a free man , I take pride in the words Ich bin ein Berliner<speech_sep>Reverend Meza , Reverend Reck , I am grateful for your generous invitation to speak my views . While the so called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight , I want to emphasize from the outset that we have far more critical issues to face in the 1960 election the spread of Communist influence , until it now festers 90 miles off the coast of Florida the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice President by those who no longer respect our power the hungry children I saw in West Virginia , the old people who cannot pay their doctor bills , the families forced to give up their farms an America with too many slums , with too few schools , and too late to the moon and outer space . These are the real issues which should decide this campaign . And they are not religious issues for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barriers . But because I am a Catholic , and no Catholic has ever been elected President , the real issues in this campaign have been obscured perhaps deliberately , in some quarters less responsible than this . So it is apparently necessary for me to state once again not what kind of church I believe in , for that should be important only to me but what kind of America I believe in . I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute where no Catholic prelate would tell the President how to act , and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him . I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic , Protestant nor Jewish where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope , the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all . For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed , in other years it has been , and may someday be again , a Jew or a Quaker or a Unitarian or a Baptist . It was Virginia s harassment of Baptist preachers , for example , that helped lead to Jefferson s statute of religious freedom . Today I may be the victim but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national peril . Finally , I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end where all men and all churches are treated as equal where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice where there is no Catholic vote , no anti Catholic vote , no bloc voting of any kind and where Catholics , Protestants and Jews , at both the lay and pastoral level , will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past , and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood . That is the kind of America in which I believe . And it represents the kind of Presidency in which I believe a great office that must neither be humbled by making it the instrument of any one religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group . I believe in a President whose religious views are his own private affair , neither imposed by him upon the Nation or imposed by the Nation upon him as a condition to holding that office . I would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert the first amendment s guarantees of religious liberty . Nor would , our system of checks and balances permit him to do so and neither do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test even by indirection for it . If they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly working to repeal it . I want a Chief Executive whose public acts are responsible to all groups and obligated to none who can attend any ceremony , service , or dinner his office may appropriately require of him and whose fulfillment of his Presidential oath is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath , ritual , or obligation . This is the kind of America I believe in and this is the kind I fought for in the South Pacific , and the kind my brother died for in Europe . No one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty , that we did not believe in liberty or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the freedoms for which our forefathers died . And in fact this is the kind of America for which our forefathers died when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches when they fought for the Constitution , the Bill of Rights , and the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom and when they fought at the shrine I visited today , the Alamo . For side by side with Bowie and Crockett died McCafferty and Bailey and Carey but no one knows whether they were Catholics or not . For there was no religious test at the Alamo . I ask you tonight to follow in that tradition to judge me on the basis of my record of 14 years in Congress on my declared stands against an Ambassador to the Vatican , against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools , and against any boycott of the public schools instead of judging me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of Catholic church leaders , usually in other countries , frequently in other centuries , and always omitting , of course , the statement of the American Bishops in 1948 which strongly endorsed church state separation , and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every American Catholic . I do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts why should you But let me say , with respect to other countries , that I am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group , Catholic or Protestant , to compel , prohibit , or persecute the free exercise of any other religion . And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their Presidency to Protestants and those which deny it to Catholics . And rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ , I would cite the record of the Catholic Church in such nations as Ireland and France and the independence of such statesmen as Adenauer and De Gaulle . But let me stress again that these are my views for , contrary to common newspaper usage , I am not the Catholic candidate for President . I am the Democratic Party s candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic . I do not speak for my Church on public matters and the Church does not speak for me . Whatever issue may come before me as President in birth control , divorce , censorship , gambling or any other subject I will make my decision in accordance with these views , in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest , and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates . And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise . But if the time should ever come and I do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest , then I would resign the office and I hope any conscientious public servant would do the same . But I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either Catholic or Protestant faith nor do I intend to disavow either my views or my Church in order to win this election . If I should lose on the real issues , I shall return to my seat in the Senate , satisfied that I had tried my best and was fairly judged . But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized , then it is the whole Nation that will be the loser , in the eyes of Catholics and non Catholics around the world , in the eyes of history , and in the eyes of our own people . But if , on the other hand , I should win the election , then I shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency practically identical , I might add , to the oath I have taken for 14 years in the Congress . For , without reservation , I can solemly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution , so help me God .<speech_sep>President Griswold , members of the faculty , graduates and their families , ladies and gentlemen Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for the very deep honor that you have conferred upon me . As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledges America to be the daughter of Europe , so I am pleased to come to Yale , the daughter of Harvard . It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds , a Harvard education and a Yale degree . I am particularly glad to become a Yale man because as I think about my troubles , I find that a lot of them have come from other Yale men . Among businessmen , I have had a minor disagreement with Roger Blough , of the law school class of 1931 , and I have had some complaints , too , from my friend Henry Ford , of the class of 1940 . In journalism I seem to have a difference with John Hay Whitney , of the class of 1926 and sometimes I also displease Henry Luce of the class of 1920 , not to mention also William Buckley , , of the class of 1950 . I even have some trouble with my Yale advisers . I get along with them , but I am not always sure how they get along with each other . I have the warmest feelings for Chester Bowles of the class of 1924 , and for Dean Acheson of the class of 1915 , and my assistant , McGeorge Bundy , of the class of 1940 . But I am not 100 percent sure that these three wise and experienced Yale men wholly agree with each other on every issue . So this administration which aims at peaceful cooperation among all Americans has been the victim of a certain natural pugnacity developed in this city among Yale men . Now that too , am a Yale man , it is time for peace . Last week at West Point , in the historic tradition of that Academy , I availed myself of the powers of Commander in Chief to remit all sentences of offending cadets . In that same spirit , and in the historic tradition of Yale , let me now offer to smoke the clay pipe of friendship with all of my brother Ells , and I hope that they may be friends not only with me but even with each other . In any event , I am very glad to be here and as a new member of the club , I have been checking to see what earlier links existed between the institution of the Presidency and Yale . I found that a member of the class of 1878 , William Howard Taft , served one term in the White House as preparation for becoming a member of this faculty . And a graduate of 1804 , John Calhoun , regarded the Vice Presidency , quite naturally , as too lowly a status for a Yale alumnus and became the only man in history to ever resign that office . Calhoun in 1804 and Taft in 1878 graduated into a world very different from ours today . They and their contemporaries spent entire careers stretching over 40 years in grappling with a few dramatic issues on which the Nation was sharply and emotionally divided , issues that occupied the attention of a generation at a time the national bank , the disposal of the public lands , nullification or union , freedom or slavery , gold or silver . Today these old sweeping issues very largely have disappeared . The central domestic issues of our time are more subtle and less simple . They relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues . The world of Calhoun , the world of Taft had its own hard problems and notable challenges . But its problems are not our problems . Their age is not our age . As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truisms and stereotypes , so in our own time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases to a new , difficult , but essential confrontation with reality . For the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate , contrived , and dishonest but the myth persistent , persuasive , and unrealistic . Too often we hold fast to the cliches of our forebears . We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations . We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought . Mythology distracts us everywhere in government as in business , in politics as in economics , in foreign affairs as in domestic affairs . But today I want to particularly consider the myth and reality in our national economy . In recent months many have come to feel , as I do , that the dialog between the parties between business and government , between the government and the public is clogged by illusion and platitude and fails to reflect the true realities of contemporary American society . I speak of these matters here at Yale because of the self evident truth that a great university is always enlisted against the spread of illusion and on the side of reality . No one has said it more clearly than your President Griswold Liberal learning is both a safeguard against false ideas of freedom and a source of true ones . Your role as university men , whatever your calling , will be to increase each new generation s grasp of its duties . There are three great areas of our domestic affairs in which , today , there is a danger that illusion may prevent effective action . They are , first , the question of the size and the shape of government s responsibilities second , the question of public fiscal policy and third , the matter of confidence , business confidence or public confidence , or simply confidence in America . I want to talk about all three , and I want to talk about them carefully and dispassionately and I emphasize that I am concerned here not with political debate but with finding ways to separate false problems from real ones . If a contest in angry argument were forced upon it , no administration could shrink from response , and history does not suggest that American Presidents are totally without resources in an engagement forced upon them because of hostility in one sector of society . But in the wider national interest , we need not partisan wrangling but common concentration on common problems . I come here to this distinguished university to ask you to join in this great task . Let us take first the question of the size and shape of government . The myth here is that government is big , and bad and steadily getting bigger and worse . Obviously this myth has some excuse for existence . It is true that in recent history each new administration has spent much more money than its predecessor . Thus President Roosevelt outspent President Hoover , and with allowances for the special case of the Second World War , President Truman outspent President Roosevelt . Just to prove that this was not a partisan matter , President Eisenhower then outspent President Truman by the handsome figure of 182 billion . It is even possible , some think , that this trend may continue . But does it follow from this that big government is growing relatively bigger It does not for the fact is for the last 15 years , the Federal Government and also the Federal debt and also the Federal bureaucracy have grown less rapidly than the economy as a whole . If we leave defense and space expenditures aside , the Federal Government since the Second World War has expanded less than any other major sector of our national life less than industry , less than commerce , less than agriculture , less than higher education , and very much less than the noise about big government . The truth about big government is the truth about any other great activity it is complex . Certainly it is true that size brings dangers but it is also true that size can bring benefits . Here at Yale which has contributed so much to our national progress in science and medicine , it may be proper for me to mention one great and little noticed expansion of government which has brought strength to our whole society the new role of our Federal Government as the major patron of research in science and in medicine . Few people realize that in 1961 , in support of all university research in science and medicine , three dollars out of every four came from the Federal Government . I need hardly point out that this has taken place without undue enlargement of Government control that American scientists remain second to none in their independence and in their individualism . I am not suggesting that Federal expenditures cannot bring some measure of control . The whole thrust of Federal expenditures in agriculture have been related by purpose and design to control , as a means of dealing with the problems created by our farmers and our growing productivity . Each sector , my point is , of activity must be approached on its own merits and in terms of specific national needs . Generalities in regard to federal expenditures , therefore , can be misleading each case , science , urban renewal , education , agriculture , natural resources , each case must be determined on its merits if we are to profit from our unrivaled ability to combine the strength of public and private purpose . Next , let us turn to the problem of our fiscal policy . Here the myths are legion and the truth hard to find . But let me take as a prime example the problem of the Federal budget . We persist in measuring our federal fiscal integrity today by the conventional or administrative budget with results which would be regarded as absurd in any business firm in any country of Europe or in any careful assessment of the reality of our national finances . The administrative budget has sound administrative uses . But for wider purposes it is less helpful . It omits our special trust funds and the effect that they have on our economy it neglects changes in assets or inventories . It cannot tell a loan from a straight expenditure and worst of all it cannot distinguish between operating expenditures and long term investments . This budget , in relation to the great problems of Federal fiscal policy which are basic to our economy in 1962 , is not simply irrelevant it can be actively misleading . And yet there is a mythology that measures all of our national soundness or unsoundness on the single simple basis of this same annual administrative budget . If our Federal budget is to serve not the debate but the country , we must and will find ways of clarifying this area of discourse . Still in the area of fiscal policy , let me say a word about deficits . The myth persists that Federal deficits create inflation and budget surpluses prevent it . Yet sizeable budget surpluses after the war did not prevent inflation , and persistent deficits for the last several years have not upset our basic price stability . Obviously deficits are sometimes dangerous and so are surpluses . But honest assessment plainly requires a more sophisticated view than the old and automatic cliche that deficits automatically bring inflation . There are myths also about our public debt . It is widely supposed that this debt is growing at a dangerously rapid rate . In fact , both the debt per person and the debt as a proportion of our gross national product have declined sharply since the Second World War . In absolute terms the national debt since the end of World War II has increased only 8 percent , while private debt was increasing 305 percent , and the debts of State and local governments on whom people frequently suggest we should place additional burdens the debts of State and local governments have increased 378 percent . Moreover , debts , public and private , are neither good nor bad , in and of themselves . Borrowing can lead to over extension and collapse but it can also lead to expansion and strength . There is no single , simple slogan in this field that we can trust . Finally , I come to the problem of confidence . Confidence is a matter of myth and also a matter of truth and this time let me take the truth of the matter first . It is true and of high importance that the prosperity of this country depends on the assurance that all major elements within it will live up to their responsibilities . If business were to neglect its obligations to the public , if labor were blind to all public responsibility , above all , if government were to abandon its obvious and statutory duty of watchful concern for our economic health if any of these things should happen , then confidence might well be weakened and the danger of stagnation would increase . This is the true issue of confidence . But there is also the false issue and its simplest form is the assertion that any and all unfavorable turns of the speculative wheel however temporary and however plainly speculative in character are the result of , and I quote , a lack of confidence in the national administration . This I must tell you , while comforting , is not wholly true . Worse , it obscures the reality which is also simple . The solid ground of mutual confidence is the necessary partnership of government with all of the sectors of our society in the steady quest for economic progress . Corporate plans are not based on a political confidence in party leaders but on an economic confidence in the Nation s ability to invest and produce and consume . Business had full confidence in the administrations in power in 1929 , 1954 , 1958 , and 1960 but this was not enough to prevent recession when business lacked full confidence in the economy . What matters is the capacity of the Nation as a whole to deal with its economic problems and its opportunities . The stereotypes I have been discussing distract our attention and divide our effort . These stereotypes do our Nation a disservice , not just because they are exhausted and irrelevant , but above all because they are misleading because they stand in the way of the solution of hard and complicated facts . It is not new that past debates should obscure present realities . But the damage of such a false dialogue is greater today than ever before simply because today the safety of all the world the very future of freedom depends as never before upon the sensible and clearheaded management of the domestic affairs of the United States . The real issues of our time are rarely as dramatic as the issues of Calhoun . The differences today are usually matters of degree . And we cannot understand and attack our contemporary problems in 1962 if we are bound by traditional labels and worn out slogans of an earlier era . But the unfortunate fact of the matter is that our rhetoric has not kept pace with the speed of social and economic change . Our political debates , our public discourse on current domestic and economic issues too often bear little or no relation to the actual problems the United States faces . What is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion but the practical management of a modern economy . What we need is not labels and cliches but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical questions involved in keeping a great economic machinery moving ahead . The national interest lies in high employment and steady expansion of output , in stable prices , and a strong dollar . The declaration of such an objective is easy their attainment in an intricate and interdependent economy and world is a little more difficult . To attain them , we require not some automatic response but hard thought . Let me end by suggesting a few of the real questions on our national agenda . First , how can our budget and tax policies supply adequate revenues and preserve our balance of payments position without slowing up our economic growth Two , how are we to set our interest rates and regulate the flow of money in ways which will stimulate the economy at home , without weakening the dollar abroad Given the spectrum of our domestic and international responsibilities , what should be the mix between fiscal and monetary policy Let me give several examples from my experience of the complexity of these matters and how political labels and ideological approaches are irrelevant to the solution . Last week , a distinguished graduate of this school , Senator Proxmire , of the class of 1938 , who is ordinarily regarded as a liberal Democrat , suggested that we should follow in meeting our economic problems a stiff fiscal policy , with emphasis on budget balance and an easy monetary policy with low interest rates in order to keep our economy going . In the same week , the Bank for International Settlement in Basel , Switzerland , a conservative organization representing the central bankers of Europe suggested that the appropriate economic policy in the United States should be the very opposite that we should follow a flexible budget policy , as in Europe , with deficits when the economy is down and a high monetary policy on interest rates , as in Europe , in order to control inflation and protect goals . Both may be right or wrong . It will depend on many different factors . The point is that this is basically an administrative or executive problem in which political labels or cliches do not give us a solution . A well known business journal this morning , as I journeyed to New Haven , raised the prospects that a further budget deficit would bring inflation and encourage the flow of gold . We have had several budget deficits beginning with a 12 1 2 billion deficit in 1958 , and it is true that in the fall of 1960 we had a gold dollar loss running at 5 billion annually . This would seem to prove the case that a deficit produces inflation and that we lose gold , yet there was no inflation following the deficit of 1958 nor has there been inflation since then . Our wholesale price index since 1958 has remained completely level in spite of several deficits , because the loss of gold has been due to other reasons price instability , relative interest rates , relative export import balances , national security expenditures all the rest . Let me give you a third and final example . At the World Bank meeting in September , a number of American bankers attending predicted to their European colleagues that because of the fiscal 1962 budget deficit , there would be a strong inflationary pressure on the dollar and a loss of gold . Their predictions of inflation were shared by many in business and helped push the market up . The recent reality of non inflation helped bring it down . We have had no inflation because we have had other factors in our economy that have contributed to price stability . I do not suggest that the Government is right and they are wrong . The fact of the matter is in the Federal Reserve Board and in the administration this fall , a similar view was held by many well informed and disinterested men that inflation was the major problem that we would face in the winter of 1962 . But it was not . What I do suggest is that these problems are endlessly complicated and yet they go to the future of this country and its ability to prove to the world what we believe it must prove . I am suggesting that the problems of fiscal and monetary policies in the sixties as opposed to the kinds of problems we faced in the thirties demand subtle challenges for which technical answers , not political answers , must be provided . These are matters upon which government and business may and in many cases will disagree . They are certainly matters that government and business should be discussing in the most dispassionate , and careful way if we to maintain the kind of vigorous upon which our country depends . How can we develop and sustain strong and stable world markets for basic commodities without unfairness to the consumer and without undue stimulus to the producer How can we generate the buying power which can consume what we produce on our farms and in our factories How can we take advantage of the miracles of automation with the great demand that it will put upon highly skilled labor and yet offer employment to the half million of unskilled school dropouts each year who enter the labor market , eight million of them in the 1960 s How do we eradicate the barriers which separate substantial minorities of our citizens from access to education and employment on equal terms with the rest How , in sum , can we make our free economy work at full capacity that is , provide adequate profits for enterprise , adequate wages for labor , adequate utilization of plant , and opportunity for all These are the problems that we should be talking about that the political parties and the various groups in our country should be discussing . They cannot be solved by incantations from the forgotten past . But the example of Western Europe shows that they are capable of solution that governments , and many of them are conservative governments , prepared to face technical problems without ideological preconceptions , can coordinate the elements of a national economy and bring about growth and prosperity a decade of it . Some conversations I have heard in our own country sound like old records , long playing , left over from the middle thirties . The debate of the thirties had its great significance and produced great results , but it took place in a different world with different needs and different tasks . It is our responsibility today to live in our own world , and to identify the needs and discharge the tasks of the 1960 s . If there is any current trend toward meeting present problems with old cliches , this is the moment to stop it before it lands us all in a bog of sterile acrimony . Discussion is essential and I am hopeful that the debate of recent weeks , though up to now somewhat barren , may represent the start of a serious dialog of the kind which has led in Europe to such fruitful collaboration among all the elements of economic society and to a decade of unrivaled economic progress . But let us not engage in the wrong argument at the wrong time between the wrong people in the wrong country while the real problems of our own time grow and multiply , fertilized by our neglect . Nearly 150 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote , The new circumstances under which we are placed call for new words , new phrases , and for the transfer of old words to new objects . New words , new phrases , the transfer of old words to new objects that is truer today than it was in the time of Jefferson , because the role of this country is so vastly more significant . There is a show in England called Stop the World , I Want to Get Off . You have not chosen to exercise that option . You are part of the world and you must participate in these days of our years in the solution of the problems that pour upon us , requiring the most sophisticated and technical judgment and as we work in consonance to meet the authentic problems of our times , we will generate a vision and an energy which will demonstrate anew to the world the superior vitality and the strength of the free society .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , Members of the Congress It is a pleasure to return from whence I came . You are among my oldest friends in Washington and this House is my oldest home . It was here , more than 14 years ago , that I first took the oath of Federal office . It was here , for 14 years , that I gained both knowledge and inspiration from members of both parties in both Houses from your wise and generous leaders and from the pronouncements which I can vividly recall , sitting where you now sit including the programs of two great Presidents , the undimmed eloquence of Churchill , the soaring idealism of Nehru , the steadfast words of General de Gaulle . To speak from this same historic rostrum is a sobering experience . To be back among so many friends is a happy one . I am confident that that friendship will continue . Our Constitution wisely assigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government and a President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will neither permit nor attempt any trespass . For my part , I shall withhold from neither the Congress nor the people any fact or report , past , present , or future , which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and hazards . I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to the Congress , nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions . I speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity . Before my term has ended , we shall have to test anew whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure . The outcome is by no means certain . The answers are by no means clear . All of us together this Administration , this Congress , this nation must forge those answers . But today , were I to offer after little more than a week in office detailed legislation to remedy every national ill , the Congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty of responsibility . My remarks , therefore , will be limited . But they will also be candid . To state the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the past . The prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies , and gives a faithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust . And , while the occasion does not call for another recital of our blessings and assets , we do have no greater asset than the willingness of a free and determined people , through its elected officials , to face all problems frankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear . The present state of our economy is disturbing . We take office in the wake of seven months of recession , three and one half years of slack , seven years of diminished economic growth , and nine years of falling farm income . Business bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the Great Depression . Since 1951 farm income has been squeezed down by 25 percent . Save for a brief period in 1958 , insured unemployment is at the highest peak in our history . Of some five and one half million Americans who are without jobs , more than one million have been searching for work for more than four months . And during each month some 150 , 000 workers are exhausting their already meager jobless benefit rights . Nearly , one eighth of those who are without jobs live almost without hope in nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled areas . The rest include new school graduates unable to use their talents , farmers forced to give up their part time jobs which helped balance their family budgets , skilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important industries as metals , machinery , automobiles and apparel . Our recovery from the 1958 recession , moreover , was anemic and incomplete . Our Gross National Product never regained its full potential . Unemployment never returned to normal levels . Maximum use of our national industrial capacity was never restored . In short , the American economy is in trouble . The most resourceful industrialized country on earth ranks among the last in the rate of economic growth . Since last spring our economic growth rate has actually receded . Business investment is in a decline . Profits have fallen below predicted levels . Construction is off . A million unsold automobiles are in inventory . Fewer people are working and the average work week has shrunk well below 40 hours . Yet prices have continued to rise so that now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy . Economic prophecy is at best an uncertain art as demonstrated by the prediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be , and I quote , the most prosperous year in our history . Nevertheless , forecasts of continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and 1962 have been made with alarming unanimity and this Administration does not intend to stand helplessly by . We cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plants while awaiting the end of the recession . We must show the world what a free economy can do to reduce unemployment , to put unused capacity to work , to spur new productivity , and to foster higher economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policies and relative price stability . I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a self supporting basis to provide more food for the families of the unemployed , and to aid their needy children to redevelop our areas of chronic labor surplus to expand the services of the Employment Offices to stimulate housing and construction to secure more purchasing power for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum wage to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment to increase the development of our natural resources to encourage price stability and to take other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for increased long range growth . This is not a partisan program concentrating on our weaknesses it is , I hope , a national program to realize our national strength . Efficient expansion at home , stimulating the new plant and technology that can make our goods more competitive , is also the key to the international balance of payments problem . Laying aside all alarmist talk and panicky solutions , let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective . It is true that , since 1958 , the gap between the dollars we spend or invest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened . This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly 11 billion in the 3 years and holders of dollars abroad converted them to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly 5 billion of gold from our reserve . The 1959 deficit was caused in large part by the failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets the result both of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitive prices . The 1960 deficit , on the other hand , was more the result of an increase in private capital outflow seeking new opportunity , higher return or speculative advantage abroad . Meanwhile this country has continued to bear more than its share of the West s military and foreign aid obligations . Under existing policies , another deficit of 2 billion is predicted for 1961 and individuals in those countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remain sufficient to meet our own obligations . All this is cause for concern but it is not cause for panic . For our monetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong . Including our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold reserve held as backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits , we have some 22 billion in total gold stocks and other international monetary reserves available and I now pledge that their full strength stands behind the value of the dollar for use if needed . Moreover , we hold large assets abroad the total owed this nation far exceeds the claims upon our reserves and our exports once again substantially exceed our imports . In short , we need not and we shall not take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from 35 an ounce to impose exchange controls to reduce our anti recession efforts to fall back on restrictive trade policies or to weaken our commitments around the world . This Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion . And this is a commitment . Prudence and good sense do require , however , that new steps be taken to ease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis . Our success in world affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to pay . A series of executive orders , legislative remedies and cooperative efforts with our allies will get underway immediately aimed at attracting foreign investment and travel to this country promoting American exports , at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and financing curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spending of private dollars abroad and sharing with our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands . While the current deficit lasts , ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad without placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have asked to serve our Flag overseas . In short , whatever is required will be done to back up all our efforts abroad , and to make certain that , in the future as in the past , the dollar is as sound as a dollar . But more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance . The current Federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show a net deficit . The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain in balance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures requested and only if an earlier and sharper up turn in the economy than my economic advisers now think likely produces the tax revenues estimated . Nevertheless , a new Administration must of necessity build on the spending and revenue estimates already submitted . Within that framework , barring the development of urgent national defense needs or a worsening of the economy , it is my current intention to advocate a program of expenditures which , including revenues from a stimulation of the economy , will not of and by themselves unbalance the earlier Budget . However , we will do what must be done . For our national household is cluttered with unfinished and neglected tasks . Our cities are being engulfed in squalor . Twelve long years after Congress declared our goal to be a decent home and a suitable environment for every American family , we still have 25 million Americans living in substandard homes . A new housing program under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department will be needed this year . Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have room for , taught by 90 , 000 teachers not properly qualified to teach . One third of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to continue the development of their talents . The war babies of the 1940 s , who overcrowded our schools in the 1950 s , are now descending in 1960 upon our colleges with two college students for every one , ten years from now and our colleges are ill prepared . We lack the scientists , the engineers and the teachers our world obligations require . We have neglected oceanography , saline water conversion , and the basic research that lies at the root of all progress . Federal grants for both higher and public school education can no longer be delayed . Medical research has achieved new wonders but these wonders are too often beyond the reach of too many people , owing to a lack of income , a lack of hospital beds , a lack of nursing homes and a lack of doctors and dentists . Measures to provide health care for the aged under Social Security , and to increase the supply of both facilities and personnel , must be undertaken this year . Our supply of clean water is dwindling . Organized and juvenile crimes cost the taxpayers millions of dollars each year , making it essential that we have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards . The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience , and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage . Morality in private business has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business . A host of problems and projects in all 50 States , though not possible to include in this Message , deserves and will receive the attention of both the Congress and the Executive Branch . On most of these matters , Messages will be sent to the Congress within the next two weeks . But all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us around the world . No man entering upon this office , regardless of his party , regardless of his previous service in Washington , could fail to be staggered upon learning even in this brief 10 day period the harsh enormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years . Each day the crises multiply . Each day their solution grows more difficult . Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger , as weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger . I feel I must inform the Congress that our analyses over the last ten days make it clear that in each of the principal areas of crisis the tide of events has been running out and time has not been our friend . In Asia , the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the security of the entire area from the borders of India and South Viet Nam to the jungles of Laos , struggling to protect its newly won independence . We seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia , and , indeed , in all of the world freedom for the people and independence for the government . And this Nation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objectives . In Africa , the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife , political unrest and public disorder . We shall continue to support the heroic efforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order efforts which are now endangered by mounting tensions , unsolved problems , and decreasing support from many member states . In Latin America , Communist agents seeking to exploit that region s peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores . Our objection with Cuba is not over the people s drive for a better life . Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic tyrannies . Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged . Questions of economic and trade policy can always be negotiated . But Communist domination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated . We are pledged to work with our sister republics to free the Americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny , working toward the goal of a free hemisphere of free governments , extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle . In Europe our alliances are unfulfilled and in some disarray . The unity of NATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by national interest . It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor fully achieved a common outlook . Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual problems now facing us in defense , foreign aid , monetary reserves , and a host of other areas and our close ties with those whose hopes and interests we share are among this Nation s most powerful assets . Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold War but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China . We must never be lulled into believing that either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination ambitions which they forcefully restated only a short time ago . On the contrary , our task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be profitable routes to pursue these ends . Open and peaceful competition for prestige , for markets , for scientific achievement , even for men s minds is something else again . For if Freedom and Communism were to compete for man s allegiance in a world at peace , I would look to the future with ever increasing confidence . To meet this array of challenges to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on the world scene we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tools military , economic and political . One must not overshadow the other On the Presidential Coat of Arms , the American eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch , while in his left he holds a bundle of arrows . We intend to give equal attention to both . First , we must strengthen our military tools . We are moving into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and diplomatic possibilities require a Free World force so powerful as to make any aggression clearly futile . Yet in the past , lack of a consistent , coherent military strategy , the absence of basic assumptions about our national requirements and the faulty estimates and duplication arising from inter service rivalries have all made it difficult to assess accurately how adequate or inadequate our defenses really are . I have , therefore , instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy our ability to fulfill our commitments the effectiveness , vulnerability , and dispersal of our strategic bases , forces and warning systems the efficiency and economy of our operation and organization the elimination of obsolete bases and installations and the adequacy , modernization and mobility of our present conventional and nuclear forces and weapons systems in the light of present and future dangers . I have asked for preliminary conclusions by the end of February and I then shah recommend whatever legislative , budgetary or executive action is needed in the light of these conclusions . In the meantime , I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate immediately three new steps most clearly needed now First , l have directed prompt attention to increase our air lift capacity . Obtaining additional air transport mobility and obtaining it now will better assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond , with discrimination and speed , to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment s notice . In particular it will enable us to meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our forces by starting limited wars in widely scattered parts of the globe . I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program . Using unobligated ship building funds now will build and place on station at least nine months earlier than planned substantially more units of a crucial deterrent a fleet that will never attack first , but possess sufficient powers of retaliation , concealed beneath the seas , to discourage any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security . I have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program . Until the Secretary of Defense s reappraisal is completed , the emphasis here will be largely on improved organization and decision making on cutting down the wasteful duplications and the time lag that have handicapped our whole family of missiles . If we are to keep the peace , we need an invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressor from even threatening an attack that he would know could not destroy enough of our force to prevent his own destruction . For as I said upon taking the oath of office Only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed . Secondly , we must improve our economic tools . Our role is essential and unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for the entire non communist world , helping other nations build the strength to meet their own problems , to satisfy their own aspirations to surmount their own dangers . The problems in achieving this goal are towering and unprecedented the response must be towering and unprecedented as well , much as Lend Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years , which brought such fruitful results . I intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and more effective program for assisting the economic , educational and social development of other countries and continents . That program must stimulate and take more effectively into account the contributions of our allies , and provide central policy direction for all our own programs that now so often overlap , conflict or diffuse our energies and resources . Such a program , compared to past programs , will require more flexibility for short run emergencies more commitment to long term development new attention to education at all levels greater emphasis on the recipient nation s role , their effort , their purpose , with greater social justice for their people , broader distribution and participation by their people and more efficient public administration and more efficient tax systems of their own and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of a piecemeal approach . I hope the Senate will take early action approving the Convention establishing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . This will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies this development effort working toward the time when each nation will contribute in proportion to its ability to pay . For , while we are prepared to assume our full share of these huge burdens , we cannot and must not be expected to bear them alone . To our sister republics to the south , we have pledged a new alliance for progress alianza para progreso . Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin America , realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of culture , intellect and liberty . To start this nation s role at this time in that alliance of neighbors , I am recommending the following That the Congress appropriate in full the 500 million fund pledged by the Act of Bogota , to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War , but as a first step in the sound development of the Americas . That a new Inter Departmental Task Force be established under the leadership of the Department of State , to coordinate at the highest level all policies and programs of concern to the Americas . That our delegates to the OAworking with those of other members , strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent foreign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere . That , in cooperation with other nations , we launch a new hemispheric attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities to all levels and , finally , That a Food for Peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America to explore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help end hunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our own hemisphere . This Administration is expanding its Food for Peace Program in every possible way . The product of our abundance must be used more effectively to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe . And I have asked the Director of this Program to recommend additional ways in which these surpluses can advance the interests of world peace including the establishment of world food reserves . An even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men and women not only on our college campuses but in every age group who have indicated their desire to contribute their skills , their efforts , and a part of their lives to the fight for world order . We can mobilize this talent through the formation of a National Peace Corps , enlisting the services of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign lands meet their urgent needs for trained personnel . Finally , while our attention is centered on the development of the noncommunist world , we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom and welfare of the Eastern European peoples . In order to be prepared to help re establish historic ties of friendship , I am asking the Congress for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever this is found to be clearly in the national interest . This will require amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I proposed as a member of the Senate , and upon which the Senate voted last summer . Meanwhile , I hope to explore with the Polish government the possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that will demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people of Poland . Third , we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools the means of cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must ultimately rest . I have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmament effort to increase our programs of research and study and to make arms control a central goal of our national policy under my direction . The deadly arms race , and the huge resources it absorbs , have too long overshadowed all else we must do . We must prevent that arms race from spreading to new nations , to new nuclear powers and to the reaches of outer space . We must make certain that our negotiators are better informed and better prepared to formulate workable proposals of our own and to make sound judgments about the proposals of others . I have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable delay in the talks on a nuclear test ban and it is our intention to resume negotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation that is equally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty . We must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it . In recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its membership we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the N . we shall help insure that it is properly financed . we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the Secretary General is maintained . And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the world to join with us in strengthening this organization , which is far more essential to their security than it is to ours the only body in the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure , where every nation has an equal voice , and where any nation can exert influence not according to the strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas . It deserves the support of all . Finally , this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors . Specifically , I now invite all nations including the Soviet Union to join with us in developing a weather prediction program , in a new communications satellite program and in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus , probes which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe . Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space , while the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into orbit . Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by ten moving these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the Cold War . The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits of this new knowledge available to all and , beyond that , in an effort to extend farm technology to hungry nations to wipe out disease to increase the exchanges of scientists and . their knowledge and to make our own laboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the facilities to pursue their own work . Where nature makes natural allies of us all , we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even with those with whom we most deeply disagree and this must someday be the basis of world peace and world law . I have commented on the state of the domestic economy , our balance of payments , our Federal and social budget and the state of the world . I would like to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the Executive branch . We have found it full of honest and useful public servants but their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action is needed has too often been muffled in the morass of committees , timidities and fictitious theories which have created a growing gap between decision and execution , between planning and reality . In a time of rapidly deteriorating situations at home and abroad , this is bad for the public service and particularly bad for the country and we mean to make a change . I have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative , responsibility and energy in serving the public interest . Let every public servant know , whether his post is high or low , that a man s rank and reputation in this Administration will be determined by the size of the job he does , and not by the size of his staff , his office or his budget . Let it be clear that this Administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change . Let the public service be a proud and lively career . And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government , in any branch , at any level , be able to say with pride and with honor in future years I served the United States government in that hour of our nation s need . For only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can we bring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead . Our problems are critical . The tide is unfavorable . The news will be worse before it is better . And while hoping and working for the best , we should prepare ourselves now for the worst . We cannot escape our dangers neither must we let them drive us into panic or narrow isolation . In many areas of the world where the balance of power already rests with our adversaries , the forces of freedom are sharply divided . It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor in its servants . while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for privilege , materialism and a life of case . But I have a different view of liberty . Life in 1961 will not be easy . Wishing it , predicting it , even asking for it , will not make it so . There will be further setbacks before the tide is turned . But turn it we must . The hopes of all mankind rest upon us not simply upon those of us in this chamber , but upon the peasant in Laos , the fisherman in Nigeria , the exile from Cuba , the spirit that moves every man and Nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the future . And in the final analysis , they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance of our fellow citizens of the great Republic . In the words of a great President , whose birthday we honor today , closing his final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago , We pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us .<speech_sep>Chancellor , Vanderbilt , Senator Kefauver , Senator Gore , Congressman Fulton , Congressman Evins , Congressman Bass , Congressman Everett , Tom Murray , distinguished guests , members of the judiciary , the Army Corps of Engineers of the Tennessee Valley I first of all want to express my warm appreciation to the Governor and to the Mayor of this State and city and to the people for a very generous welcome , and particularly to all those young men and women who lined the street and played music for us as we drove into this stadium . We are glad they are here with us , and we feel the musical future of this city and State is assured . Many things bring us together today . We are saluting the 90th anniversary of Vanderbilt University , which has grown from a small Tennessee university and institution to one of our Nation s greatest , with 7 different colleges , and with more than half of its 4200 students from outside of the State of Tennessee . And we are saluting the 30th anniversary of the Tennessee Valley Authority , which transformed a parched , depressed , and floodravaged region into a fertile , productive center of industry , science , and agriculture . We are saluting by initiating construction of a dam in his name a great Tennessee statesman , Cordell Hull , the father of reciprocal trade , the grandfather of the United Nations , the Secretary of State who presided over the transformation of this Nation from a life of isolation and almost indifference to a state of responsible world leadership . And finally , we are saluting by the recognition of a forthcoming dam in his name Percy Priest , a former colleague of mine in the House of Representatives , who represented this district , this State , and this Nation in the Congress for 16 turbulent years years which witnessed the crumbling of empires , the splitting of the atom , the conquest of one threat to freedom , and the emergence of still another . If there is one unchanging theme that runs throughout these separate stories , it is that everything changes but change itself . We live in an age of movement and change , both evolutionary and revolutionary , both good and evil and in such an age a university has a special obligation to hold fast to the best of the past and move fast to the best of the future . Nearly 100 years ago Prince Bismarck said that one third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork , another third broke down from dissipation , and the other third ruled Germany . I do not know which third of the student body of Vanderbilt is here today , but I am confident we are talking to the future rulers of Tennessee and America in the spirit of this university . The essence of Vanderbilt is still learning , the essence of its outlook is still liberty , and liberty and learning will be and must be the touchstones of Vanderbilt University and of any free university in this country or the world . I say two touchstones , yet they are almost inseparable , inseparable if not indistinguishable , for liberty without learning is always in peril , and learning without liberty is always in vain . This State , this city , this campus , have stood long for both human rights and human enlightenment and let that forever be true . This Nation is now engaged in a continuing debate about the rights of a portion of its citizens . That will go on , and those rights will expand until the standard first forged by the Nation s founders has been reached , and all Americans enjoy equal opportunity and liberty under law . But this Nation was not founded solely on the principle of citizens rights . Equally important , though too often not discussed , is the citizen s responsibility . For our privileges can be no greater than our obligations . The protection of our rights can endure no longer than the performance of our responsibilities . Each can be neglected only at the peril of the other . I speak to you today , therefore , not of your rights as Americans , but of your responsibilities . They are many in number and different in nature . They do not rest with equal weight upon the shoulders of all . Equality of opportunity does not mean equality of responsibility . All Americans must be responsible citizens , but some must be more responsible than others , by virtue of their public or their private position , their role in the family or community , their prospects for the future , or their legacy from the past . Increased responsibility goes with increased ability , for of those to whom much is given , much is required . Commodore Vanderbilt recognized this responsibility and his recognition made possible the establishment of a great institution of learning for which he will be long remembered after his steamboats and railroads have been forgotten . I speak in particular , therefore , of the responsibility of the educated citizen , including the students , the faculty , and the alumni of this great institution . The creation and maintenance of Vanderbilt University , like that of all great universities , has required considerable effort and expenditure , and I cannot believe that all of this was undertaken merely to give this school s graduates an economic advantage in the life struggle . Every man sent out from a university , said Professor Woodrow Wilson , Every man sent out from a university should be a man of his Nation , as well as a man of his time . You have responsibilities , in short , to use your talents for the benefit of the society which helped develop those talents . You must decide , as Goethe put it , whether you will be an anvil or a hammer , whether you will give to the world in which you were reared and educated the broadest possible benefits of that education . Of the many special obligations incumbent upon an educated citizen , I would cite three as outstanding your obligation to the pursuit of learning , your obligation to serve the public , your obligation to uphold the law . If the pursuit of learning is not defended by the educated citizen , it will not be defended at all . For there will always be those who scoff at intellectuals , who cry out against research , who seek to limit our educational system . Modern cynics and skeptics see no more reason for landing a man on the moon , which we shall do , than the cynics and skeptics of half a millennium ago saw for the discovery of this country . They see no harm in paying those to whom they entrust the minds of their children a smaller wage than is paid to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing . But the educated citizen knows how much more there is to know . He knows that knowledge is power , more so today than ever before . He knows that only an educated and informed people will be a free people , that the ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all , and that if we can , as Jefferson put it , enlighten the people generally . . . tyranny and the oppressions of mind and body will vanish , like evil spirits at the dawn of day . And , therefore , the educated citizen has a special obligation to encourage the pursuit of learning , to promote exploration of the unknown , to preserve the freedom of inquiry , to support the advancement of research , and to assist at every level of government the improvement of education for all Americans , from grade school to graduate school . Secondly , the educated citizen has an obligation to serve the public . He may be a precinct worker or President . He may give his talents at the courthouse , the State house , the White House . He may be a civil servant or a Senator , a candidate or a campaign worker , a winner or a loser . But he must be a participant and not a spectator . At the Olympic games , Aristotle wrote , it is not the finest and strongest men who are crowned , but they who enter the lists for out of these the prize men are elected . So , too , in life , of the honorable and the good , it is they who act who rightly win the prizes . I urge all of you today , especially those who are students , to act , to enter the lists of public service and rightly win or lose the prize . For we can have only one form of aristocracy in this country , as Jefferson wrote long ago in rejecting John Adams suggestion of an artificial aristocracy of wealth and birth . It is , he wrote , the natural aristocracy of character and talent , and the best form of government , he added , was that which selected these men for positions of responsibility . I would hope that all educated citizens would fulfill this obligation in politics , in Government , here in Nashville , here in this State , in the Peace Corps , in the Foreign Service , in the Government Service , in the Tennessee Valley , in the world . You will find the pressures greater than the pay . You may endure more public attacks than support . But you will have the unequaled satisfaction of knowing that your character and talent are contributing to the direction and success of this free society . Third , and finally , the educated citizen has an obligation to uphold the law . This is the obligation of every citizen in a free and peaceful society but the educated citizen has a special responsibility by the virtue of his greater understanding . For whether he has ever studied history or current events , ethics or civics , the rules of a profession or the tools of a trade , he knows that only a respect for the law makes it possible for free men to dwell together in peace and progress . He knows that law is the adhesive force in the cement of society , creating order out of chaos and coherence in place of anarchy . He knows that for one man to defy a law or court order he does not like is to invite others to defy those which they do not like , leading to a breakdown of all justice and all order . He knows , too , that every fellowman is entitled to be regarded with decency and treated with dignity . Any educated citizen who seeks to subvert the law , to suppress freedom , or to subject other human beings to acts that are less than human , degrades his heritage , ignores his learning , and betrays his obligation . Certain other societies may respect the rule of force we respect the rule of law . The Nation , indeed the whole world , has watched recent events in the United States with alarm and dismay . No one can deny the complexity of the problems involved in assuring to all of our citizens their full fights as Americans . But no one can gainsay the fact that the determination to secure these rights is in the highest traditions of American freedom . In these moments of tragic disorder , a special burden rests on the educated men and women of our country to reject the temptations of prejudice and violence , and to reaffirm the values of freedom and law on which our free society depends . When Bishop McTyeire , 90 years ago , proposed it to Commodore Vanderbilt , he said , Commodore , our country has been torn to pieces by a civil war . . . . We want to repair this damage . And Commodore Vanderbilt reportedly replied , I want to unite this country , and all sections of it , so that all our people will be one . His response , his recognition of his obligation and opportunity gave Vanderbilt University not only an endowment but also a mission . Now , 90 years later , in a time of tension , it is more important than ever to unite this country and strengthen these ties so that all of our people will be one . Ninety years from now I have no doubt that Vanderbilt University will still be fulfilling this mission . It will still uphold learning , encourage public service , and teach respect for the law . It will neither turn its back on proven wisdom or turn its face from newborn challenge . It will still pass on to the youth of our land the full meaning of their rights and their responsibilities . And it will still be teaching the truth the truth that makes us free and will keep us free . Thank you .<speech_sep>Good evening , Howe . Howe , Vice President . First uh let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu . I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955 . I have sustained it since then . I have said that I agree with the Administration policy . Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands , two miles off the coast of China , were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores . I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa , which is part of the Eisenhower policy . I have supported that policy . In the last week , as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , I have re read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959 , and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958 , and I have accurately described the Administration policy , and I support it wholeheartedly . So that really is not an issue in this campaign . It is not an issue with Nixon , who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy . Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign . The question is are we moving in the direction of peace and security Is our relative strength growing Is , as Nixon says , our prestige at an all time high , as he said a week ago , and that of the Communists at an all time low I do not believe it is . I do not believe that our relative strength is increasing . And I say that not as the Democratic standard bearer , but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States . I look at Cuba , ninety miles off the coast of the United States . In 1957 I was in Havana . I talked to the American Ambassador there . He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba . And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner , both Republican Ambassadors , both warned of Castro , the Marxist influences around Castro , the Communist influences around Castro , both of them have testified in the last six weeks , that in spite of their warnings to the American government , nothing was done . Our d security depends upon Latin America . Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what is happening today , when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call not on Washington during the campaign but on Castro in Havana , in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil At the American Conference Inter American Conference this summer , when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists , we could not even get the Inter American group to join together in denouncing Castro . It was rather a vague statement that they finally made . Do you know today that the Com the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do Do you know we do not have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba to tell them our story , to tell them that we are their friends , that we want them to be free again Africa is now the emerging area of the world . It contains twenty five percent of all the members of the General Assembly . We did not even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957 . In the Africa south of the Sahara , which is the major new section , we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand . If there is one thing Africa needs it is technical assistance . And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world . We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact , and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed , the Baghdad Pact broke down . We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East , which passed the Senate . There is not one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine . We look to Europe uh to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world . Which system , Communism or freedom , will triumph in the next five or ten years That is what should concern us , not the history of ten , or fifteen , or twenty years ago . But are we doing enough in these areas What are freedom s chances in those areas By 1965 or 1970 , will there be other Cubas in Latin America Will Guinea and Ghana , which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa will there be others Will the Congo go Communist Will other countries Are we doing enough in that area And what about Asia Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years Communism The Chinese Or will freedom The question which we have to decide as Americans are we doing enough today Is our strength and prestige rising Do people want to be identified with us Do they want to follow United States leadership I do not think they do , enough . And that is what concerns me . In Africa these countries that have newly joined the United Nations . On the question of admission of Red China , only two countries in all of Africa voted with us Liberia and the Union of South Africa . The rest either abstained or voted against us . More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us . I believe that this struggle is going to go on , and it may be well decided in the next decade . I have seen Cuba go to the Communists . I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America . I have seen us ignore Africa . There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations . There is not a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six . When Guinea became independent , the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day . We did not recognize them for two months the American Ambassador did not show up for nearly eight months . I believe that the world is changing fast . And I do not think this Administration has shown the foresight , has shown the knowledge , has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free , to get a better standard of living , to live better . The average income in some of those countries is twenty five dollars a year . The Communists say , Come with us look what we have done . And we have been in on the whole , uninterested . I think we are going to have to do better . Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world . I think we are today . But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago , and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them . They made a breakthrough in missiles , and by nineteen sixty one , two , and three , they will be outnumbering us in missiles . I am not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963 . He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom . I agree with him . What we do in this country , the kind of society that we build , that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world . And yet , in the last nine months of this year , we have had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain . We have had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world . I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon . The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them . And yet they were polled by the S . The point of all this is , this is a struggle in which we are engaged . We want peace . We want freedom . We want security . We want to be stronger . We want freedom to gain . But I do not believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing has identified itself with that change . I think the Communists have been moving with vigor Laos , Africa , Cuba all around the world today they are on the move . I think we have to revita1ize our society . I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we are determined in this free country of ours to be first not first if , and not first but , and not first when but first . And when we are strong and when we are first , then freedom gains then the prospects for peace increase then the prospects for our society gain . Nixon uh shows himself i misinformed . He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States , flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains . There is not any doubt about that , number one . Number two , I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral . They have to include the other countries of Latin America . The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba s economy I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America , through Europe , and through Eastern Europe . If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro . That is the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime and also the countries of Western Europe , Canada , Japan and the others . Number three , Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America . The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries Mexico , Panama , Bolivia , Colombia . We are going to have to try to provide closer ties , to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we are going to prevent Castro s influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America . His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine . His influence is growing mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America . You yourself said , Vice President , a month ago , that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro . Why did not we Edwards , I do not think it is a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively , or to suggest four people indicate that one of them surely will be appointed . This is a decision that the president of the United States must make . The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Dewey in 1948 . This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States . There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state . I have made no judgment about who should be secretary of state . I think that judgment could be made after election , if I am successful . The people have to make a choice between Nixon and myself , between the Republican party and the Democratic party , between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power . The president bears the constitutional responsibility , not the secretary of state , for the conduct of foreign affairs . Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy others have relied heavily on the secretary of state . I have been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility , really , given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events , is in the field of foreign affairs . I am asking the people s support as president . We will select the best man we can get . But I have not made a judgment , and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people , among whom would be the candidate . I really do not need uh Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen . I have served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service . I have just as high a devotion , just as high an opinion . What I downgrade , Nixon , is the leadership the country is getting , not the country . Now I did not make most of the statements that you said I made . The s I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space . We have may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest you yourself said to Khrushchev , You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we are ahead of you in color television in your famous discussion in the kitchen . I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust . Secondly , I did not say we had the worst slums in the world . I said we had too many slums . And that they are bad , and we ought to do something about them , and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed . I did not say we had the worst education in the world . What I said was that ten years ago , we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they are producing twice as many as we are , and that this affects our security around the world . And fourth , I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago . Part of that is because we have stood still here at home , because we have not met our problems in the United States , because we have not had a moving economy . Part of that , as the Gallup Polls show , is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space . George Allen , head of your Information Service , has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science . We are first in other areas of science but in space , which is the new science , we are not first . Yes , I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests , number one . I think we should go back to Geneva , who is ever elected president , Nixon or myself , and try once again . If we fail then , if we are unable to come to an agreement and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States , Britain , France , and the Soviet Union as atomic powers . Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there is some indications that by the time the next president s term of office has come to an end , there may be ten , fifteen , or twenty countries with an atomic capacity , perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity , with more and more chance of war . So one more effort should be made . I do not think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere . They can be carried out underground , they c could be carried on in outer space . But I believe the effort should be made once more by who is ever elected president of the United States . If we fail , it is been a great serious failure for everyone for the human race . I hope we can succeed . But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we will have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States , and there may have to be testing underground . I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it . There may be testing in outer space . I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh testing in the atmosphere . It is possible to detect those kind of tests . The kind of tests which you cannot detect are underground or in in uh perhaps in outer space . So that I am hopeful we can try once more . If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves . But I am most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons . China may have it by 1963 , Egypt . War has been the constant companion of mankind , so to have these weapons disseminated around the world , I believe means that we are going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years . We ought to make one last effort . Well , I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he had go to the summit in May he did last fall , he indicated that there should be some agenda , that there should be some prior agreement . He hoped that there would be uh b be an agreement in part in disarmament . He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin . The Soviet Union refused to agree to that , and we went to the summit and it was disastrous . I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin , outer space , or general disarmament including nuclear testing . In addition , I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States . The Soviet Union does understand strength . We arm to parley , Winston Churchill said ten years ago . If we are strong , particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin which we may in the spring , or in the winter it is important that we maintain our determination here that we indicate that we are building our strength that we are determined to protect our position that we are determined to protect our commitment . And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world . But until we are strong here , until we are moving here , I believe a summit could not be successful . I hope that before we do meet , there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions , or at least two of them , or even one of them , which would warrant such a meeting . I think if we had stuck by that position last winter , we would have been in a better position in May . One of the areas , and of course the most vulnerable area is I have felt , has been Eastern Europe . I have been critical of the Administration s failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish , for example , closer relations with Poland , particularly after the fifty five fifty six period and the Hungarian revolution . We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily . But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn di distance away from the Soviet Union . I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties . We received the support first of the Administration and then not , and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate . We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it did not pass the House . I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh s of the Soviet Union . Secondly , the relations between Russia and China . They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion , infiltration , economic struggles and all the rest . No one can say what that course of action will be , but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully . If those two powers should split , it could have great effects throughout the entire world . Thirdly , I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world . India started from about the same place that China did . Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years . India under a free society has been making some progress . But if India does not succeed with her four hundred and fifty million people , if she cannot make freedom work then people around the world are going to determine particularly in the underdeveloped world that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system . Fourth , let me say that in Africa , Asia , Latin America , Eastern Europe , the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free . This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe . It is expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe . They want to be free . And my judgment is that they do not want to give their freedom up to become Communists . They want to stay free , independent perhaps of us , but certainly independent of the Communists . And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force , if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln , as Wilson did , as Franklin Roosevelt did , if we become known as the friend of freedom , sustaining freedom , helping freedom , helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease , helping them build their lives , I believe in Latin America , Africa , and Asia , eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East , certainly in Western Europe , we can strengthen freedom . We can make it move . We can put the Communists on the defensive . Well , Nixon , to go back to 1955 . The resolution commits the president in the United States , which I supported , to defend uh Formosa , the Pescadores , and if it was his military judgment , these islands . Then the President sent a mission , composed of Admiral Radford and Robertson , to persuade Chiang Kai shek in the spring of fifty five to withdraw from the two islands , because they were exposed . The President was unsuccessful Chiang Kai shek would not withdraw . I refer to the fact that in 1958 , as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , I am very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands . General Twining , in January , fifty nine , described the position of the United States . The position of the United States has been that this build up , in the words of the president , has been foolish . Herter has said these islands are indefensible . Chiang Kai shek will not withdraw . Because he will not withdraw , because he is committed to these islands , because we have been unable to persuade him to withdraw , we are in a very difficult position . And therefore , the President s judgment has been that we should defend the islands if , in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field , the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa . I support that . In view of the difficulties we have had with the islands , in view of the difficulties and disputes we have had with Chiang Kai shek , that is the only position we can take . That is not the position you took , however . The first position you took , when this matter first came up , was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves , as a matter of principle , to defend these islands . Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores . You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands . And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai shek s withdrawal from these islands . And that is the testimony of uh General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty eight . I uh said that I have served this country for fourteen years . I served it uh in the war . I am devoted to it . If I lose this election , I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country . But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward , to make a determination here at home and around the world , that it is going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society . My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States , and it is also stood still around the world . Uh We are using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today . We had a recession in fifty eight . We had a recession in fifty four . We are not moving ahead in education the way we should . We did not make a judgment in fifty seven and fifty six and fifty five and fifty four that outer space would be important . If we stand still here , if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook , who do not recognize that this is a revolutionary time , then the United States does not maintain its influence . And if we fail , the cause of freedom fails . I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again , to get our economy moving ahead , to set before the American people its goals , its unfinished business . And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get , ambassadors who can speak the language no mere not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language . Bring students here let them see what kind of a country we have . Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war we should identify ourselves with them . If that were true , why did not we identify ourselves with the people of Africa Why did not we bring students over here Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government . I believe that this party Republican party has stood still really for twenty five years its leadership has . It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources , the Tennessee Valley and all the rest . And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement , which believes in going ahead , then we can reestablish our position in the world strong defense , strong in economic growth , justice for our people , co guarantee of constitutional rights , so that people will believe that we practice what we preach , and then around the world , particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt . He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States because they saw us as a society that was compassionate , that cared about people , that was moving this country ahead . I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still . We can no longer afford to be second best . I want people all over the world to look to the United States again , to feel that we are on the move , to feel that our high noon is in the future . I want Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States , and that they are going to put this country back to work again . I do not believe that there is anything this country cannot do . I do not believe there is any burden , or any responsibility , that any American would not assume to protect his country , to protect our security , to advance the cause of freedom . And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that . Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny . I believe in 1960 and sixty one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny . And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom and to do that , we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again .<speech_sep>
