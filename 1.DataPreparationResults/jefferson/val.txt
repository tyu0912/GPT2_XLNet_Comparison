TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATEAgreeably to the request of the House of Representatives , communicated in their resolution of the 16th instant , I proceed to state under the reserve therein expressed , information received touching an illegal combination of private individuals against the peace and safety of the Union , and a military expedition planned by them against the territories of a power in amity with the United States , with the measures I have pursued for suppressing the same . I had for some time been in the constant expectation of receiving such further information as would have enabled me to lay before the legislature the termination as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity , so far it has been acted on the Ohio and its waters . From this the state and safety of the lower country might have been estimated on probable grounds , and the delay was indulged the rather , because no circumstance had yet made it necessary to call in the aid of the legislative functions . Information now recently communicated has brought us nearly to the period contemplated . The mass of what I have received , in the course of these transactions , is voluminous , but little has been given under the sanction of an oath , so as to constitute formal and legal evidence . It is chiefly in the form of letters , often containing such a mixture of rumors , conjectures , and suspicions , as render it difficult to sift out the real facts , and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines , strengthened by concurrent information , or the particular credibility of the relater . In this state of the evidence , delivered sometimes too under the restriction of private confidence , neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names , except that of the principal actor , whose guilt is placed beyond question . Some time in the latter part of September , I received intimations that designs were in agitation in the western country , unlawful and unfriendly to the peace of the Union and that the prime mover in these was Aaron Burr , heretofore distinguished by the favor of his country . The grounds of these intimations being inconclusive , the objects uncertain , and the fidelity of that country known to be firm , the only measure taken was to urge the informants to use their best endeavors to get further insight into the designs and proceedings of the suspected persons , and to communicate them to me . It was not until the latter part of October , that the objects of the conspiracy began to be perceived , but still so blended and involved in mystery that nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit . In this state of uncertainty as to the crime contemplated , the acts done , and the legal course to be pursued , I thought it best to send to the scene where these things were principally in transaction , a person , in whose integrity , understanding , and discretion , entire confidence could be reposed , with instructions to investigate the plots going on , to enter into conference for which he had sufficient credentials with the governors and all other officers , civil and military , and with their aid to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the designs of the conspirators , arrest their means , bring their persons to punishment , and to call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which it should be found they were engaged . By this time it was known that many boats were under preparation , stores of provisions collecting , and an unusual number of suspicious characters in motion on the Ohio and its waters . Besides despatching the confidential agent to that quarter , orders were at the same time sent to the governors of the Orleans and Mississippi territories , and to the commanders of the land and naval forces there , to be on their guard against surprise , and in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which might be attempted on the vessels , posts , or other objects under their care and on the 8th of November , instructions were forwarded to General Wilkinson to hasten an accommodation with the Spanish commander on the Sabine , and as soon as that was effected , to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the Mississippi , for the defence of the intersecting points on that river . By a letter received from that officer on the 25th of November , but dated October 21st , we learn that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him , with communications partly written in cipher and partly oral , explaining his designs , exaggerating his resources , and making such offers of emolument and command , to engage him and the army in his unlawful enterprise , as he had flattered himself would be successful . The general , with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a good citizen , immediately despatched a trusty officer to me with information of what had passed , proceeding to establish such an understanding with the Spanish commandant on the Sabine as permitted him to withdraw his force across the Mississippi , and to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise . The general s letter , which came to hand on the 25th of November , as has been mentioned , and some other information received a few days earlier , when brought together , developed Burr s general designs , different parts of which only had been revealed to different informants . It appeared that he contemplated two distinct objects , which might be carried on either jointly or separately , and either the one or the other first , as circumstances should direct . One of these was the severance of the Union of these States by the Alleghany mountains the other , an attack on Mexico . A third object was provided , merely ostensible , to wit the settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the Washita , claimed by a Baron Bastrop . This was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations , an allurement for such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country , and a cover under which to retreat in the event of final discomfiture of both branches of his real design . He found at once that the attachment of the western country to the present Union was not to be shaken that its dissolution could not be effected with the consent of its inhabitants , and that his resources were inadequate , as yet , to effect it by force . He took his course then at once , determined to seize on New Orleans , plunder the bank there , possess himself of the military and naval stores , and proceed on his expedition to Mexico and to this object all his means and preparations were now directed . He collected from all the quarters where himself or his agents possessed influence , all the ardent , restless , desperate , and disaffected persons who were ready for any enterprise analogous to their characters . He seduced good and well meaning citizens , some by assurances that he possessed the confidence of the government and was acting under its secret patronage , a pretence which obtained some credit from the state of our differences with Spain and others by offers of land in Bastrop s claim on the Washita . This was the state of my information of his proceedings about the last of November , at which time , therefore , it was first possible to take specific measures to meet them . The proclamation of November 27 , two days after the receipt of General Wilkinson s information , was now issued . Orders were despatched to every intersecting point on the Ohio and Mississippi , from Pittsburg to New Orleans , for the employment of such force either of the regulars or of the militia , and of such proceedings also of the civil authorities , as might enable them to seize on all the boats and stores provided for the enterprise , to arrest the persons concerned , and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise . A little before the receipt of these orders in the State of Ohio , our confidential agent , who had been diligently employed in investigating the conspiracy , had acquired sufficient information to open himself to the governor of that State , and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the State to crush the combination . Governor Tiffin and the legislature , with a promptitude , an energy , and patriotic zeal , which entitle them to a distinguished place in the affection of their sister States , effected the seizure of all the boats , provisions , and other preparations within their reach , and thus gave a first blow , materially disabling the enterprise in its outset . In Kentucky , a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice , without sufficient evidence for his conviction , had produced a popular impression in his favor , and a general disbelief of his guilt . This gave him an unfortunate opportunity of hastening his equipments . The arrival of the proclamation and orders , and the application and information of our confidential agent , at length awakened the authorities of that State to the truth , and then produced the same promptitude and energy of which the neighboring State had set the example . Under an act of their legislature of December 23 , militia was instantly ordered to different important points , and measures taken for doing whatever could yet be done . Some boats accounts vary from five to double or treble that number and persons differently estimated from one to three hundred had in the meantime passed the falls of the Ohio , to rendezvous at the mouth of the Cumberland , with others expected down that river . Not apprized , till very late , that any boats were building on Cumberland , the effect of the proclamation had been trusted to for some time in the State of Tennessee but on the 19th of December , similar communications and instructions with those of the neighboring States were despatched by express to the governor , and a general officer of the western division of the State , and on the 23rd of December our confidential agent left Frankfort for Nashville , to put into activity the means of that State also . But by information received yesterday I learn that on the 22rd of December , Burr descended the Cumberland with two boats merely of accommodation , carrying with him from that State no quota toward his unlawful enterprise . Whether after the arrival of the proclamation , of the orders , or of our agent , any exertion which could be made by that State , or the orders of the governor of Kentucky for calling out the militia at the mouth of Cumberland , would be in time to arrest these boats , and those from the falls of the Ohio , is still doubtful . On the whole , the fugitives from Ohio , with their associates from Cumberland , or any other place in that quarter , cannot threaten serious danger to the city of New Orleans . By the same express of December nineteenth , orders were sent to the governors of New Orleans and Mississippi , supplementary to those which had been given on the 25th of November , to hold the militia of their territories in readiness to co operate for their defence , with the regular troops and armed vessels then under command of General Wilkinson . Great alarm , indeed , was excited at New Orleans by the exaggerated accounts of Burr , disseminated through his emissaries , of the armies and navies he was to assemble there . General Wilkinson had arrived there himself on the 24th of November and had immediately put into activity the resources of the place for the purpose of its defence and on the tenth of December he was joined by his troops from the Sabine . Great zeal was shown by the inhabitants generally , the merchants of the place readily agreeing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for manning the armed vessels with their seamen , and the other citizens manifesting unequivocal fidelity to the Union , and a spirit of determined resistance to their expected assailants . Surmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive aid from certain foreign powers . But these surmises are without proof or probability . The wisdom of the measures sanctioned by Congress at its last session had placed us in the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with whom we had any differences , and nothing has happened since which makes it either their interest or ours to pursue another course . No change of measures has taken place on our part none ought to take place at this time . With the one , friendly arrangement was then proposed , and the law deemed necessary on the failure of that was suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue . With the same power , negotiation is still preferred and provisional measures only are necessary to meet the event of rupture . While , therefore , we do not deflect in the slightest degree from the course we then assumed , and are still pursuing , with mutual consent , to restore a good understanding , we are not to impute to them practices as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith , and changing necessarily the relations of peace and justice between us to those of war . These surmises are , therefore , to be imputed to the vauntings of the author of this enterprise , to multiply his partisans by magnifying the belief of his prospects and support . By letters from General Wilkinson , of the 14th and 18th of September , which came to hand two days after date of the resolution of the House of Representatives , that is to say , on the morning of the 18th instant , I received the important affidavit , a copy of which I now communicate , with extracts of so much of the letters as come within the scope of the resolution . By these it will be seen that of three of the principal emissaries of Burr , whom the general had caused to be apprehended , one had been liberated by habeas corpus , and the two others , being those particularly employed in the endeavor to corrupt the general and army of the United States , have been embarked by him for our ports in the Atlantic States , probably on the consideration that an impartial trial could not be expected during the present agitations of New Orleans , and that that city was not as yet a safe place of confinement . As soon as these persons shall arrive , they will be delivered to the custody of the law , and left to such course of trial , both as to place and process , as its functionaries may direct . The presence of the highest judicial authorities , to be assembled at this place within a few days , the means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere , and the aid of the executive means , should the judges have occasion to use them , render it equally desirable for the criminals as for the public , that being already removed from the place where they were first apprehended , the first regular arrest should take place here , and the course of proceedings receive here its proper direction .<speech_sep>TO BROTHER HANDSOME LAKI have received the message in writing which you sent me through Captain Irvine , our confidential agent , placed near you for the purpose of communicating and transacting between us , whatever may be useful for both nations . I am happy to learn you have been so far favored by the Divine spirit as to be made sensible of those things which are for your good and that of your people , and of those which are hurtful to you and particularly that you and they see the ruinous effects which the abuse of spirituous liquors have produced upon them . It has weakened their bodies , enervated their minds , exposed them to hunger , cold , nakedness , and poverty , kept them in perpetual broils , and reduced their population . I do not wonder then , brother , at your censures , not only on your own people , who have voluntarily gone into these fatal habits , but on all the nations of white people who have supplied their calls for this article . But these nations have done to you only what they do among themselves . They have sold what individuals wish to buy , leaving to every one to be the guardian of his own health and happiness . Spirituous liquors are not in themselves bad , they are often found to be an excellent medicine for the sick it is the improper and intemperate use of them , by those in health , which makes them injurious . But as you find that your people cannot refrain from an ill use of them , I greatly applaud your resolution not to use them at all . We have too affectionate a concern for your happiness to place the paltry gain on the sale of these articles in competition with the injury they do you . And as it is the desire of your nation , that no spirits should be sent among them , I am authorized by the great council of the United States to prohibit them . I will sincerely cooperate with your wise men in any proper measures for this purpose , which shall be agreeable to them . You remind me , brother , of what I said to you , when you visited me the last winter , that the lands you then held would remain yours , and shall never go from you but when you should be disposed to sell . This I now repeat , and will ever abide by . We , indeed , are always ready to buy land but we will never ask but when you wish to sell and our laws , in order to protect you against imposition , have forbidden individuals to purchase lands from you and have rendered it necessary , when you desire to sell , even to a State , that an agent from the United States should attend the sale , see that your consent is freely given , a satisfactory price paid , and report to us what has been done , for our approbation . This was done in the late case of which you complain . The deputies of your nation came forward , in all the forms which we have been used to consider as evidence of the will of your nation . They proposed to sell to the State of New York certain parcels of land , of small extent , and detached from the body of your other lands the State of New York was desirous to buy . I sent an agent , in whom we could trust , to see that your consent was free , and the sale fair . All was reported to be free and fair . The lands were your property . The right to sell is one of the rights of property . To forbid you the exercise of that right would be a wrong to your nation . Nor do I think , brother , that the sale of lands is , under all circumstances , injurious to your people . While they depended on hunting , the more extensive the forest around them , the more game they would yield . But going into a state of agriculture , it may be as advantageous to a society , as it is to an individual , who has more land than he can improve , to sell a part , and lay out the money in stocks and implements of agriculture , for the better improvement of the residue . A little land well stocked and improved , will yield more than a great deal without stock or improvement . I hope , therefore , that on further reflection , you will see this transaction in a more favorable light , both as it concerns the interest of your nation , and the exercise of that superintending care which I am sincerely anxious to employ for their subsistence and happiness . Go on then , brother , in the great reformation you have undertaken . Persuade our red brethren then to be sober , and to cultivate their lands and their women to spin and weave for their families . You will soon see your women and children well fed and clothed , your men living happily in peace and plenty , and your numbers increasing from year to year . It will be a great glory to you to have been the instrument of so happy a change , and your children s children , from generation to generation , will repeat your name with love and gratitude forever . In all your enterprises for the good of your people , you may count with confidence on the aid and protection of the United States , and on the sincerity and zeal with which I am myself animated in the furthering of this humane work . You are our brethren of the same land we wish your prosperity as brethren should do . Farewell .<speech_sep>We have long heard of your nation as a numerous , peaceable , and friendly people but this is the first visit we have had from its great men at the seat of our government . I welcome you here am glad to take you by the hand , and to assure you , for your nation , that we are their friends . Born in the same land , we ought to live as brothers , doing to each other all the good we can , and not listening to wicked men , who may endeavor to make us enemies . By living in peace , we can help and prosper one another by waging war , we can kill and destroy many on both sides but those who survive will not be the happier for that . Then , brothers , let it forever be peace and good neighborhood between us . Our seventeen States compose a great and growing nation . Their children are as the leaves of the trees , which the winds are spreading over the forest . But we are just also . We take from no nation what belongs to it . Our growing numbers make us always willing to buy lands from our red brethren , when they are willing to sell . But be assured we never mean to disturb them in their possessions . On the contrary , the lines established between us by mutual consent , shall be sacredly preserved , and will protect your lands from all encroachments by our own people or any others . We will give you a copy of the law , made by our great Council , for punishing our people , who may encroach on your lands , or injure you otherwise . Carry it with you to your homes , and preserve it , as the shield which we spread over you , to protect your land , your property and persons . It is at the request which you sent me in September , signed by Puckshanublee and other chiefs , and which you now repeat , that I listen to your proposition to sell us lands . You say you owe a great debt to your merchants , that you have nothing to pay it with but lands , and you pray us to take lands , and pay your debt . The sum you have occasion for , brothers , is a very great one . We have never yet paid as much to any of our red brethren for the purchase of lands . You propose to us some on the Tombigbee , and some on the Mississippi . Those on the Mississippi suit us well . We wish to have establishments on that river , as resting places for our boats , to furnish them provisions , and to receive our people who fall sick on the way to or from New Orleans , which is now ours . In that quarter , therefore , we are willing to purchase as much as you will spare . But as to the manner in which the line shall be run , we are not judges of it here , nor qualified to make any bargain . But we will appoint persons hereafter to treat with you on the spot , who , knowing the country and quality of the lands , will be better able to agree with you on a line which will give us a just equivalent for the sum of money you want paid . You have spoken , brothers , of the lands which your fathers formerly sold and marked off to the English , and which they ceded to us with the rest of the country they held here and you say that , though you do not know whether your fathers were paid for them , you have marked the line over again for us , and do not ask repayment . It has always been the custom , brothers , when lands were bought of the red men , to pay for them immediately , and none of us have ever seen an example of such a debt remaining unpaid . It is to satisfy their immediate wants that the red men have usually sold lands and in such a case , they would not let the debt be unpaid . The presumption from custom then is strong so it is also from the great length of time since your fathers sold these lands . But we have , moreover , been informed by persons now living , and who assisted the English in making the purchase , that the price was paid at the time . Were it otherwise , as it was their contract , it would be their debt , not ours . I rejoice , brothers , to hear you propose to become cultivators of the earth for the maintenance of your families . Be assured you will support them better and with less labor , by raising stock and bread , and by spinning and weaving clothes , than by hunting . A little land cultivated , and a little labor , will procure more provisions than the most successful hunt and a woman will clothe more by spinning and weaving , than a man by hunting . Compared with you , we are but as of yesterday in this land . Yet see how much more we have multiplied by industry , and the exercise of that reason which you possess in common with us . Follow then our example , brethren , and we will aid you with great pleasure . The clothes and other necessaries which we sent you the last year , were , as you supposed , a present from us . We never meant to ask land or any other payment for them and the store which we sent on , was at your request also and to accommodate you with necessaries at a reasonable price , you wished of course to have it on your land but the land would continue yours , not ours . As to the removal of the store , the interpreter , and the agent , and any other matters you may wish to speak about , the Secretary at War will enter into explanations with you , and whatever he says , you may consider as said by myself , and what he promises you will be faithfully performed . I am glad , brothers , you are willing to go and visit some other parts of our country . Carriages shall be ready to convey you , and you shall be taken care of on your journey and when you shall have returned here and rested yourselves to your own mind , you shall be sent home by land . We had provided for your coming by land , and were sorry for the mistake which carried you to Savannah instead of Augusta , and exposed you to the risks of a voyage by sea . Had any accident happened to you , though we could not help it , it would have been a cause of great mourning to us . But we thank the Great Spirit who took care of you on the ocean , and brought you safe and in good health to the seat of our great Council and we hope His care will accompany and protect you , on your journey and return home and that He will preserve and prosper your nation in all its just pursuits .<speech_sep>GENTLEMAI have received the remonstrance you were pleased to address to me , on the appointment of Samuel Bishop to the office of collector of New Haven , lately vacated by the death of David Austin . The right of our fellow citizens to represent to the public functionaries their opinion on proceedings interesting to them , is unquestionably a constitutional right , often useful , sometimes necessary , and will always be respectfully acknoleged by me . Of the various executive duties , no one excites more anxious concern than that of placing the interests of our fellow citizens in the hands of honest men , with understandings sufficient for their station . No duty , at the same time , is more difficult to fulfil . The knolege of characters possessed by a single individual is , of necessity , limited . To seek out the best through the whole Union , we must resort to other information , which , from the best of men , acting disinterestedly and with the purest motives , is sometimes incorrect . In the case of Samuel Bishop , however , the subject of your remonstrance , time was taken , information was sought , and such obtained as could leave no room for doubt of his fitness . From private sources it was learnt that his understanding was sound , his integrity pure , his character unstained . And the offices confided to him within his own State , are public evidences of the estimation in which he is held by the State in general , and the city and township particularly in which he lives . He is said to be the town clerk , a justice of the peace , mayor of the city of New Haven , an office held at the will of the legislature , chief judge of the court of common pleas for New Haven county , a court of high criminal and civil jurisdiction wherein most causes are decided without the right of appeal or review , and sole judge of the court of probates , wherein he singly decides all questions of wills , settlement of estates , testate and intestate , appoints guardians , settles their accounts , and in fact has under his jurisdiction and care all the property real and personal of persons dying . The two last offices , in the annual gift of the legislature , were given to him in May last . Is it possible that the man to whom the legislature of Connecticut has so recently committed trusts of such difficulty and magnitude , is unfit to be the collector of the district of New Haven , tho acknoleged in the same writing , to have obtained all this confidence by a long life of usefulness It is objected , indeed , in the remonstrance , that he is 77 . years of age but at a much more advanced age , our Franklin was the ornament of human nature . He may not be able to perform in person , all the details of his office but if he gives us the benefit of his understanding , his integrity , his watchfulness , and takes care that all the details are well performed by himself or his necessary assistants , all public purposes will be answered . The remonstrance , indeed , does not allege that the office has been illy conducted , but only apprehends that it will be so . Should this happen in event , be assured I will do in it what shall be just and necessary for the public service . In the meantime , he should be tried without being prejudged . The removal , as it is called , of Goodrich , forms another subject of complaint . Declarations by myself in favor of political tolerance , exhortations to harmony and affection in social intercourse , and to respect for the equal rights of the minority , have , on certain occasions , been quoted and misconstrued into assurances that the tenure of offices was to be undisturbed . But could candor apply such a construction It is not indeed in the remonstrance that we find it but it leads to the explanations which that calls for . When it is considered , that during the late administration , those who were not of a particular sect of politics were excluded from all office when , by a steady pursuit of this measure , nearly the whole offices of the U S were monopolized by that sect when the public sentiment at length declared itself , and burst open the doors of honor and confidence to those whose opinions they more approved , was it to be imagined that this monopoly of office was still to be continued in the hands of the minority Does it violate their equal rights , to assert some rights in the majority also Is it political intolerance to claim a proportionate share in the direction of the public affairs Can they not harmonize in society unless they have everything in their own hands If the will of the nation , manifested by their various elections , calls for an administration of government according with the opinions of those elected if , for the fulfilment of that will , displacements are necessary , with whom can they so justly begin as with persons appointed in the last moments of an administration , not for its own aid , but to begin a career at the same time with their successors , by whom they had never been approved , and who could scarcely expect from them a cordial cooperation Goodrich was one of these . Was it proper for him to place himself in office , without knowing whether those whose agent he was to be would have confidence in his agency Can the preference of another , as the successor to Austin , be candidly called a removal of Goodrich If a due participation of office is a matter of right , how are vacancies to be obtained Those by death are few by resignation , none . Can any other mode than that of removal be proposed This is a painful office but it is made my duty , and I meet it as such . I proceed in the operation with deliberation and inquiry , that it may injure the best men least , and effect the purposes of justice and public utility with the least private distress that it may be thrown , as much as possible , on delinquency , on oppression , on intolerance , on incompetence , on ante revolutionary adherence to our enemies . The remonstrance laments that a change in the administration must produce a change in the subordinate officers in other words , that it should be deemed necessary for all officers to think with their principal . But on whom does this imputation bear On those who have excluded from office every shade of opinion which was not theirs Or on those who have been so excluded lament sincerely that unessential differences of political opinion should ever have been deemed sufficient to interdict half the society from the rights and the blessings of self government , to proscribe them as characters unworthy of every trust . It would have been to me a circumstance of great relief , had I found a moderate participation of office in the hands of the majority . I would gladly have left to time and accident to raise them to their just share . But their total exclusion calls for prompter correctives . shall correct the procedure but that done , disdain to follow it , shall return with joy to that state of things , when the only questions concerning a candidate shall be , is he honest Is he capable Is he faithful to the Constitution I tender you the homage of my high respect .<speech_sep>GENTLEMAThe affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me , on behalf of the Danbury Baptist Association , give me the highest satisfaction . My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents , and in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties , the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing . Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legislative powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , thus building a wall of separation between church and State . Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience , I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights , convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties . I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common Father and Creator of man , and tender you for yourselves and your religious association , assurances of my high respect and esteem .<speech_sep>To Meriwether Lewis esq . Capt . of the 1st regimt . of infantry of the of A . Your situation as Secretary of the President of the has made you acquainted with the objects of my confidential message of Jan . 18 , 1803 to the legislature you have seen the act they passed , which , tho expressed in general terms , was meant to sanction those objects , and you are appointed to carry them into execution . Instruments for ascertaining , by celestial observations , the geography of the country through which you will pass , have been already provided . Light articles for barter and presents among the Indians , arms for your attendants , say for from 10 . to 12 . men , boats , tents , other travelling apparatus , with ammunition , medecine , surgical instruments and provisions you will have prepared with such aids as the Secretary at War can yield in his department from him also you will recieve authority to engage among our troops , by voluntary agreement , the number of attendants above mentioned , over whom you , as their commanding officer , are invested with all the powers the laws give in such a case . As your movements while within the limits of the will be better directed by occasional communications , adapted to circumstances as they arise , they will not be noticed here . What follows will respect your proceedings after your departure from the United states . Your mission has been communicated to the ministers here from France , Spain Great Britain , and through them to their governments such assurances given them as to its objects , as we trust will satisfy them . The country of Louisiana having been ceded by Spain to France , the passport you have from the minister of France , the representative of the present sovereign of the country , will be a protection with all its subjects that from the minister of England will entitle you to the friendly aid of any traders of that allegiance with whom you may happen to meet . The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river , such principal stream of it , as , by it is course communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean , whether the Columbia , Oregan , Colorado or and other river may offer the most direct practicable water communication across this continent , for the purposes of commerce . Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri , you will take careful observations of latitude longitude , at all remarkeable points on the river , especially at the mouths of rivers , at rapids , at islands , other places objects distinguished by such natural marks characters of a durable kind , as that they may with certainty be recognised hereafter . The courses of the river between these points of observation may be supplied by the compass the log line by time , corrected by the observations themselves . The variations of the compass too , in different places , should be noticed . The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri , of the water offering the best communication with the Pacific ocean , should also be fixed by observation , the course of that water to the ocean , in the same manner as that of the Missouri . Your observations are to be taken with great pains accuracy , to be entered distinctly intelligibly for others as well as yourself , to comprehend all the elements necessary , with the aid of the usual tables , to fix the latitude and longitude of the places at which they were taken , and are to be rendered to the war office , for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently by proper persons within the Several copies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at leisure times , put into the care of the most trustworthy of your attendants , to guard , by multiplying them , against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed . A further guard would be that one of these copies be on the paper of the birch , as less liable to injury from damp than common paper . The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will pursue , renders a knolege of those people important . You will therefore endeavor to make yourself acquainted , as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit , with the names of the nations their numbers the extent limits of their possessions their relations with other tribes of nations their language , traditions , monuments their ordinary occupations in agriculture , fishing , hunting , war , arts , the implements for these their food , clothing , domestic accommodations the diseases prevalent among them , the remedies they use moral physical circumstances which distinguish them from the tribes we know peculiarities in their laws , customs dispositions and articles of commerce they may need or furnish , to what extent . And , considering the interest which every nation has in extending strengthening the authority of reason justice among the people around them , it will be useful to acquire what knolege you can of the state of morality , religion , information among them as it may better enable those who endeavor to civilize instruct them , to adapt their measure to the existing notions practices of those on whom they are to operate . Other objects worthy of notice will be the soil face of the country , it is growth vegetable productions , especially those not of the the animals of the country generally , especially those not known in the the remains or accounts of any which may be deemed rare or extinct the mineral productions of every kind but more particularly metals , limestone , pit coal , saltpetre salines mineral waters , noting the temperature of the last , such circumstances as may indicate their character volcanic appearances climate , as characterized by the thermometer , by the proportion of rainy , cloudy , clear days , by lightening , hail , snow , ice , by the access recess of frost , by the winds prevailing at different seasons , the dates at which particular plants put forth or lose their flower , or leaf , times of appearance of particular birds , reptiles or insects . Altho your route will be along the channel of the Missouri , yet you will endeavor to inform yourself , by enquiry , of the character extent of the country watered by it is branches , especially on it is Southern side . The North river or Rio Bravo which runs into the gulph of Mexico , and the North river , or Rio colorado which runs into the gulph of California , are understood to be the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of the Missouri , and running Southwardly . Whether the dividing grounds between the Missouri them are mountains or flatlands , what are their distance from the Missouri , the character of the intermediate country , the people inhabiting it , are worthy of particular enquiry . The Northern waters of the Missouri are less to be enquired after , becaue they have been ascertained to a considerable degree , are still in a course of ascertainment by English traders , and travellers . But if you can learn any thing certain of the most Northern source of the Missisipi , of its position relatively to the lake of the woods , it will be interesting to us . Some account too of the path of the Canadian traders from the Missisipi , at the mouth of the Ouisconsin to where it strikes the Missouri , of the soil and rivers in it is course , is desireable . In all your intercourse with the natives , treat them in the most friendly conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit allay all jealousies as to the object of your journey , satisfy them of its innocence , make them acquainted with the position , extent , character , peaceable commercial dispositions of the of our wish to be neighborly , friendly useful to them , of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them confer with them on the points most convenient as mutual emporiums , and the articles of most desireable interchange for them us . If a few of their influential chiefs , within practicable distance , wish to visit us , arrange such a visit with them , and furnish them with authority to call on our officers , on their entering the S to have them conveyed to this place at the public expense . If any of them should wish to have some of their young people brought up with us , taught such arts as may be useful to them , we will receive , instruct take care of them . Such a mission , whether of influential chiefs or of young people , would give some security to your own party . Carry with you some matter of the kinepox inform those of them with whom you may be , of it s efficacy as a preservative from the small pox instruct incourage them in the use of it . This may be especially done wherever you winter . As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will be recieved by those people , whether with hospitality or hostility , so is it impossible to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance with which you are to pursue your journey . We value too much the lives of citizens to offer them to probable destruction . Your numbers will be sufficient to secure you against the unauthorised opposition of individuals or of small parties but if a superior force , authorised , or not authorised , by a nation , should be arrayed against your further passage , and inflexibly determined to arrest it , you must decline its further pursuit , and return . In the loss of yourselves , we should lose also the information you will have acquired . By returning safely with that , you may enable us to renew the essay with better calculated means . To your own discretion therefore must be left the degree of danger you may risk , and the point at which you should decline , only saying we wish you to err on the side of your safety , and to bring back your party safe even it if be with less information . As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend , an intercourse will probably be found to exist between them the Spanish post of Louis opposite Cahokia , or Ste . Genevieve opposite Kaskaskia . From still further up the river , the traders may furnish a conveyance for letters . Beyond that , you may perhaps be able to engage Indian to bring letters for the government to Cahokia or Kaskaskia , on promising that they shall there receive such special compensation as you shall have stipulated with them . Avail yourself of these means to communicate to us , at seasonable intervals , a copy of your journal , notes observations , of every kind , putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed . Should you reach the Pacific ocean inform yourself of the circumstances which may decide whether the furs of those parts may not be collected as advantageously at the head of the Missouri convenient as it supposed to the waters of the Colorado Oregan or Columbia as at Nootka sound , or any other point of that coast and that trade be consequently conducted through the Missouri more beneficially than by the circumnavigation now practised . On your arrival on that coast endeavor to learn if there be any port within your reach frequented by the sea vessels of any nation , to send two of your trusty people back by sea , in such way as shall appear practicable , with a copy of your notes and should you be of opinion that the return of your party by the way they went will be eminently dangerous , then ship the whole , return by sea , by way either of cape Horn , or the cape of good Hope , as you shall be able . As you will be without money , clothes or provisions , you must endeavor to use the credit of the to obtain them , for which purpose open letters of credit shall be furnished you , authorising you to draw upon the Executive of the or any of its officers , in any part of the world , on which draughts can be disposed of , to apply with our recommendations to the Consuls , agents , merchants , or citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse , assuring them , in our name , that any aids they may furnish you , shall be honorably repaid , and on demand . Our consuls Thomas Hewes at Batavia in Java , Win . Buchanan in the Isles of France Bourbon , John Elmslie at the Cape of good Hope will be able to supply your necessities by draughts on us . Should you find it safe to return by the way you go , after sending two of your party around by sea , or with your whole party , if no conveyance by sea can be found , do so making such observations on your return , as may serve to supply , correct or confirm those made on your outward journey . On re entering the and reaching a place of safety , discharge any of your attendants who may desire deserve it , procuring for them immediate paiment of all arrears of pay cloathing which may have incurred since their departure , and assure them that they shall be recommended to the liberality of the legislature for the grant of a souldier s portion of land each , as proposed in my message to Congress repair yourself with papers to the seat of government . To provide , on the accident of your death , against anarchy , dispersion , the consequent danger to your party , and total failure of the enterprize , you are hereby authorised , by any instrument signed written in your own hand , to name the person among them who shall succeed to the command on your decease , and by like instruments to change the nomination from time to time as further experience of the characters accompanying you shall point out superior fitness and all the powers and authorities given to yourself are , in the event of your death , transferred to , vested in the successor so named , with further power to him , and his successors in like manner to name each his successor , who , on the death of his predecessor , shall be invested with all the powers authorities given to yourself . Given under my hand at the city of Washington this 20th day of June 1803 . Th . Jefferson Pr . of America<speech_sep>MY FRIENDS AND CHILDRECHIEFLY OF THE CHEROKEE NATIOHaving now finished our business an to mutual satisfaction , I cannot take leave of you without expressing the satisfaction I have received from your visit . I see with my own eyes that the endeavors we have been making to encourage and lead you in the way of improving your situation have not been unsuccessful it has been like grain sown in good ground , producing abundantly . You are becoming farmers , learning the use of the plough and the hoe , enclosing your grounds and employing that labor in their cultivation which you formerly employed in hunting and in war and I see handsome specimens of cotton cloth raised , spun and wove by yourselves . You are also raising cattle and hogs for your food , and horses to assist your labors . Go on , my children , in the same way and be assured the further you advance in it the happier and more respectable you will be . Our brethren , whom you have happened to meet here from the West and Northwest , have enabled you to compare your situation now with what it was formerly . They also make the comparison , and they see how far you are ahead of them , and seeing what you are they are encouraged to do as you have done . You will find your next want to be mills to grind your corn , which by relieving your women from the loss of time in beating it into meal , will enable them to spin and weave more . When a man has enclosed and improved his farm , builds a good house on it and raised plentiful stocks of animals , he will wish when he dies that these things shall go to his wife and children , whom he loves more than he does his other relations , and for whom he will work with pleasure during his life . You will , therefore , find it necessary to establish laws for this . When a man has property , earned by his own labor , he will not like to see another come and take it from him because he happens to be stronger , or else to defend it by spilling blood . You will find it necessary then to appoint good men , as judges , to decide contests between man and man , according to reason and to the rules you shall establish . If you wish to be aided by our counsel and experience in these things we shall always be ready to assist you with our advice . My children , it is unnecessary for me to advise you against spending all your time and labor in warring with and destroying your fellow men , and wasting your own members . You already see the folly and iniquity of it . Your young men , however , are not yet sufficiently sensible of it . Some of them cross the Mississippi to go and destroy people who have never done them an injury . My children , this is wrong and must not be if we permit them to cross the Mississippi to war with the Indians on the other side of that river , we must let those Indians cross the river to take revenge on you . I say again , this must not be . The Mississippi now belongs to us . It must not be a river of blood . It is now the water path along which all our people of Natchez , Louis , Indiana , Ohio , Tennessee , Kentucky and the western parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia are constantly passing with their property , to and from New Orleans . Young men going to war are not easily restrained . Finding our people on the river they will rob them , perhaps kill them . This would bring on a war between us and you . It is better to stop this in time by forbidding your young men to go across the river to make war . If they go to visit or to live with the Cherokees on the other side of the river we shall not object to that . That country is ours . We will permit them to live in it . My children , this is what I wished to say to you . To go on in learning to cultivate the earth and to avoid war . If any of your neighbors injure you , our beloved men whom we place with you will endeavor to obtain justice for you and we will support them in it . If any of your bad people injure your neighbors , be ready to acknowledge it and to do them justice . It is more honorable to repair a wrong than to persist in it . Tell all your chiefs , your men , women and children , that I take them by the hand and hold it fast . That I am their father , wish their happiness and well being , and am always ready to promote their good . My children , I thank you for your visit and pray to the Great Spirit who made us all and planted us all in this land to live together like brothers that He will conduct you safely to your homes , and grant you to find your families and your friends in good health .<speech_sep>
