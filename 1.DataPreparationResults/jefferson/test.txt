FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENCalled upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country , I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me , to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents , and that I approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire . A rising nation , spread over a wide and fruitful land , traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry , engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right , advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye when I contemplate these transcendent objects , and see the honor , the happiness , and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day , I shrink from the contemplation , and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking . Utterly , indeed , should I despair did not the presence of many whom I here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources of wisdom , of virtue , and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties . To you , then , gentlemen , who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation , and to those associated with you , I look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world . During the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think but this being now decided by the voice of the nation , announced according to the rules of the Constitution , all will , of course , arrange themselves under the will of the law , and unite in common efforts for the common good . All , too , will bear in mind this sacred principle , that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail , that will to be rightful must be reasonable that the minority possess their equal rights , which equal law must protect , and to violate would be oppression . Let us , then , fellow citizens , unite with one heart and one mind . Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things . And let us reflect that , having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered , we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic , as wicked , and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions . During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world , during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man , seeking through blood and slaughter his long lost liberty , it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others , and should divide opinions as to measures of safety . But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle . We have called by different names brethren of the same principle . We are all Republicans , we are all Federalists . If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form , let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it . I know , indeed , that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong , that this Government is not strong enough but would the honest patriot , in the full tide of successful experiment , abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Government , the world s best hope , may by possibility want energy to preserve itself I trust not . I believe this , on the contrary , the strongest Government on earth . I believe it the only one where every man , at the call of the law , would fly to the standard of the law , and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern . Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself . Can he , then , be trusted with the government of others Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him Let history answer this question . Let us , then , with courage and confidence pursue our own Federal and Republican principles , our attachment to union and representative government . Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe too high minded to endure the degradations of the others possessing a chosen country , with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties , to the acquisitions of our own industry , to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens , resulting not from birth , but from our actions and their sense of them enlightened by a benign religion , professed , indeed , and practiced in various forms , yet all of them inculcating honesty , truth , temperance , gratitude , and the love of man acknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence , which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter with all these blessings , what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people Still one thing more , fellow citizens a wise and frugal Government , which shall restrain men from injuring one another , shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement , and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned . This is the sum of good government , and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities . About to enter , fellow citizens , on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you , it is proper you should understand what I deem the essential principles of our Government , and consequently those which ought to shape its Administration . I will compress them within the narrowest compass they will bear , stating the general principle , but not all its limitations . Equal and exact justice to all men , of whatever state or persuasion , religious or political peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations , entangling alliances with none the support of the State governments in all their rights , as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor , as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad a jealous care of the right of election by the people a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority , the vital principle of republics , from which is no appeal but to force , the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism a well disciplined militia , our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars may relieve them the supremacy of the civil over the military authority economy in the public expense , that labor may be lightly burthened the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith encouragement of agriculture , and of commerce as its handmaid the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason freedom of religion freedom of the press , and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus , and trial by juries impartially selected . These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation . The wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment . They should be the creed of our political faith , the text of civic instruction , the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm , let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace , liberty , and safety . I repair , then , fellow citizens , to the post you have assigned me . With experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest of all , I have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and the favor which bring him into it . Without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary character , whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place in his country s love and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history , I ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs . I shall often go wrong through defect of judgment . When right , I shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the whole ground . I ask your indulgence for my own errors , which will never be intentional , and your support against the errors of others , who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts . The approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past , and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance , to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power , and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all . Relying , then , on the patronage of your good will , I advance with obedience to the work , ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice it is in your power to make . And may that Infinite Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best , and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Circumstances , fellow citizens , which seriously threatened the peace of our country have made it a duty to convene you at an earlier period than usual . The love of peace so much cherished in the bosoms of our citizens , which has so long guided the proceedings of their public councils and induced forbearance under so many wrongs , may not insure our continuance in the quiet pursuits of industry . The many injuries and depredations committed on our commerce and navigation upon the high seas for years past , the successive innovations on those principles of public law which have been established by the reason and usage of nations and peace , and all the circumstances which induced the extraordinary mission to London are already known to you . The instructions given to our ministers were framed in the sincerest spirit of amity and moderation . They accordingly proceeded , in conformity therewith , to propose arrangements which might embrace and settle all the points in difference between us to a mutual understanding on our neutral and national rights provide for a commercial intercourse on conditions of some equality . After long and fruitless endeavors to effect the purposes of their mission and to obtain arrangements within the limits of their instructions , they concluded to sign such as could be obtained and to send them for consideration , candidly declaring to the other negotiations at the same time that they were acting against their instructions , and that their Government , therefore , could not be pledged for ratification . Some of the articles proposed might have been admitted on a principle of compromise , but others were too highly disadvantageous , and no sufficient provision was made against the principle source of the irritations and collisions which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations . The question , therefore , whether a treaty should be accepted in that form could have admitted but of one decision , even had no declarations of the other party impaired our confidence in it . Still anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment , new modifications were framed and further concessions authorized than could before have been supposed necessary and our ministers were instructed to resume their negotiations on these grounds . On this new reference to amicable discussion we were reposing in confidence , when on the 22d day of June last by a formal order from British admiral the frigate Cheapeake , leaving her port for a distant service , was attacked by one of those vessels which had been lying in our harbors under the indulgences of hospitality , was disabled from proceeding , had several of her crew killed and four taken away . On this outrage no commentaries are necessary . Its character has been pronounced by the indignant voice of our citizens with an emphasis and unanimity never exceeded . I immediately , by proclamation , interdicted our harbors and waters to all British armed vessels , forbade intercourse with them , and uncertain how far hostilities were intended , and the town of Norfolk , indeed being threatened with immediate attack , a sufficient force was ordered for the protection of that place , and such other preparations commenced and pursued as the prospect rendered proper . An armed vessel of the United States was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at London to call on that Government for the satisfaction and security required by the outrage . A very short interval ought now to bring the answer , which shall be communicated to you as soon as received then also , or as soon after as the public interests shall be found to admit the unratified treaty and proceedings relative to it shall be made known to you . The aggression thus begun has been continued on the part of the British commanders by remaining within our waters in defiance of the authority of the country , by habitual violations of its jurisdiction , and at length by putting to death one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on board the Chesapeake . These aggravations necessarily lead to the policy either of never admitting an armed vessel into our harbors or of maintaining in every harbor such an armed force as may constrain obedience to the laws and protect the lives and property of our citizens against their armed guests but the expense of such a standing force and its inconsistence with our principles dispense with those courtesies which would necessarily call for it , and leave us equally free to exclude the navy , as we are the army , of a foreign power from entering our limits . To former violations of maritime rights another is now added of very extensive effect . The Government of that nation has issued an order interdicting all trade by neutrals between ports not in amity with them and being now at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas , our vessels are required to sacrifice their cargos at the first port they touch or to return home without the benefit of going to any other market . Under this new law of the ocean our trade on the Mediterranean has been swept away by seizures and condemnations , and that in other seas is threatened with the same fate . Our differences with Spain remain still unsettled , no measure having been taken on her part since my last communications to Congress to bring them to a close . But under a state of things which may favor reconsideration they have been recently pressed , and an expectation is entertained that they may now soon be brought to an issue of some sort . With their subjects on our borders no new collisions have taken place nor seem immediately to be apprehended . To our former grounds of complaint has been added a very serious one , as you will see by the decree a copy of which is now communicated . Whether this decree , which professed to be conformable to that of the French Government of November 21 , 1806 , heretofore communicated to Congress , will also be conformed to that in its construction and application in relation to the United States had not been ascertained at the date of our last communications . These , however , gave reason to expect such a conformity . With the other nations of Europe our harmony has ben uninterrupted , and commerce and friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual footing . Our peace with the several states on the coast of Barbary appears as firm as at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other nation . Among our Indian neighbors in the northwestern quarter some fermentation was observed soon after the late occurences , threatening the continuance of our peace . Messages were said to be interchanged and tokens to be passing , which usually denote a state of restlessness among them , and the character of the agitators pointed to the sources of excitement . Measures were immediately taken for providing against that danger instructions were given to require explanations , and , with assurances of our continued friendship , to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home , taking no part in quarrels not belonging o them . As far as we are yet informed , the tribes in our vicinity , who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry , are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with us and to their peace with all others , while those more remote do not present appearances sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military precaution on our part . The great tribes on our southwestern quarter , much advanced beyond the others in agriculture and household arts , appear tranquil and identifying their views with ours in proportion to their advancement . With the whole of these people , in every quarter , I shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship with all their neighbors and perseverance in those occupations and pursuits which will best promote their own well being . The appropriations of the last session for the defense of our seaport towns and harbors were made under expectation that a continuance of peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience . It has been thought better to apply the sums then given toward the defense of New York , Charleston , and New Orleans chiefly as most open and most likely first to need protection , and to leave places less immediately in danger to the provisions of the present session . The gunboats , too already provided have on a like principle been chiefly assigned to New York , New Orleans , and the Chesapeake . Whether our movable force on th e water , so material in aid of the defensive works on the land , should be augmented in this or any other form is left to the wisdom of the Legislature . For the purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attacks on our harbors it is a matter for consideration whether the seamen of the United States may not justly be formed into a special militia , to be called on for tours of duty in defense of the harbors where they shall happen to be , the ordinary militia of the place furnishing that portion which may consist of landsmen . The moment our peace was threatened I deemed it indispensable to secure a greater provision of those articles of military stores with which our magazines were not sufficiently furnished . To have awaited a previous and special sanction by law would have lost occasions which might not be retrieved . I did not hesitate , therefore to authorize engagements for such supplements to our existing stock would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us , and I trust that the legislature , feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our country , so materially advanced by this precaution , will approve , when done , what they would have seen so important to be done if then assembled . Expenses , also unprovided for , arose out of the necessity of calling all our gunboats into actual service for the defense of our harbors of all which accounts will be laid before you . When a regular army is to be raised , and to what extent , must depend on the information so shortly expected . In the meantime I have called on the States for quotas of militia , to be in readiness for present defense , and have , moreover , encouraged the acceptance of volunteers and I am happy to inform you that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in every part of the Union . They are ordered to be organized and ready at a moment s warning to proceed on any service to which they may be called , and every preparation within the Executive powers has been made to insure us the benefit of earl exertions . I informed Congress at their last session of the enterprises against the public peace which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and his associates , of the measures taken to defeat them and to bring the offenders to justice . Their enterprises were happily defeated by the patriotic exertions of the militias whenever called into action , by the fidelity of the Army , and energy of the commander in chief in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves on the Sabine , repairing to meet those arising on the Mississippi , and dissipating before their explosion plots engendering there . I shall think it my duty to lay before you the proceedings and the evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the principle offenders before the circuit court of Virginia . You will be enabled to judge whether the defect was in the testimony , in the law , or in the administration of the law and whenever it shall be found , the Legislation alone can apply or originate the remedy . The framers of our Constitution certainly supposed they had guarded as well their Government against destruction by treason as their citizens against oppression under pretense of it , and if these ends are not attained it is of importance to inquire by what means more effectual they may be secured . The accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on the 30th day of September last being not yet made up , a correct statement will be hereafter transmitted from the Treasury . In the meantime , it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near 16 , 000 , 000which , with the five millions and a half in the Treasury at the beginning of the year , have enabled us , after meeting the current demands and interest incurred , to pay more than four millions of the principle of our funded debt . These payments , with those of the preceding five and a half years , have extinguished of the funded debt 25 , 500 , 000 , being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and of our contracts , and have left us in the Treasury 8 , 500 , 000 . A portion of this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumulation of the surpluses of revenue which after paying the installments of debt as they shall become payable , will remain without any specific object . It may partly , indeed , be applied toward completing the defense of the exposed points of our country , on such a scale as shall be adapted to our principles and circumstances . This object is doubtless among the first entitled to attention in such a state of our finances , and it is one which , whether we have peace or war , will provide security where it is due . Whether what shall remain of this , with the future surpluses , may be usefully applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully to others requiring new authorities , or how otherwise they shall be disposed of , are questions calling for the notice of Congress , unless , indeed , they shall be superceded by a change in our public relations now awaiting the determination of others . Whatever be that determination , it is a great consolation that it will become known at a moment when the supreme council of the nation is assembled at its post , and ready to give the aids of its wisdom and authority to whatever course the good of our country shall then call us to pursue . Matters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications , and nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give information or dispatch to the proceedings of the Legislature in the excercise of their high duties , and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare .<speech_sep>Returning to the scenes of my birth and early life , to the society of those with whom I was raised , and who have been ever dear to me , I receive , fellow citizens and neighbors , with inexpressible pleasure , the cordial welcome you are so good as to give me . Long absent on duties which the history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to them , the pomp , the turmoil , the bustle and splendor of office , have drawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of private life , for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you , my neighbors and friends , and the endearments of family love , which nature has given us all , as the sweetener of every hour . For these I gladly lay down the distressing burthen of power , and seek , with my fellow citizens , repose and safety under the watchful cares , the labors , and perplexities of younger and abler minds . The anxieties you express to administer to my happiness , do , of themselves , confer that happiness and the measure will be complete , if my endeavors to fulfill my duties in the several public stations to which I have been called , have obtained for me the approbation of my country . The part which I have acted on the theatre of public life , has been before them and to their sentence I submit it but the testimony of my native country , of the individuals who have known me in private life , to my conduct in its various duties and relations , is the more grateful , as proceeding from eye witnesses and observers , from triers of the vicinage . Of you then , my neighbors , I may ask , in the face of the world , whose ox have I taken , or whom have defrauded Whom have I oppressed , or of whose hand have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith On your verdict I rest with conscious security . Your wishes for my happiness are received with just sensibility , and I offer sincere prayers for your own welfare and prosperity .<speech_sep>Proceeding , fellow citizens , to that qualification which the constitution requires , before my entrance on the charge again conferred upon me , it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large , and the zeal with which it inspires me , so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations . On taking this station on a former occasion , I declared the principles on which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth . My conscience tells me that I have , on every occasion , acted up to that declaration , according to its obvious import , and to the understanding of every candid mind . In the transaction of your foreign affairs , we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations , and especially of those with which we have the most important relations . We have done them justice on all occasions , favored where favor was lawful , and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms . We are firmly convinced , and we act on that conviction , that with nations , as with individuals , our interests soundly calculated , will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to the fact , that a just nation is taken on its word , when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others . At home , fellow citizens , you best know whether we have done well or ill . The suppression of unnecessary offices , of useless establishments and expenses , enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes . These covering our land with officers , and opening our doors to their intrusions , had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which , once entered , is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of produce and property . If among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient , it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them , and because , if they had any merit , the state authorities might adopt them , instead of others less approved . The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles , is paid cheerfully by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts , being collected on our seaboards and frontiers only , and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens , it may be the pleasure and pride of an American to ask , what farmer , what mechanic , what laborer , ever sees a tax gatherer of the United States These contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the government , to fulfil contracts with foreign nations , to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits , to extend those limits , and to apply such a surplus to our public debts , as places at a short day their final redemption , and that redemption once effected , the revenue thereby liberated may , by a just repartition among the states , and a corresponding amendment of the constitution , be applied , _in time of peace_ , to rivers , canals , roads , arts , manufactures , education , and other great objects within each state . _In time of war_ , if injustice , by ourselves or others , must sometimes produce war , increased as the same revenue will be increased by population and consumption , and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis , it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year , without encroaching on the rights of future generations , by burdening them with the debts of the past . War will then be but a suspension of useful works , and a return to a state of peace , a return to the progress of improvement . I have said , fellow citizens , that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on , and in the meantime , may keep down the accruing interest in all events , it will repay the advances we have made . I know that the acquisition of Louisiana has been disapproved by some , from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union . But who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively The larger our association , the less will it be shaken by local passions and in any view , is it not better that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children , than by strangers of another family With which shall we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse In matters of religion , I have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government . I have therefore undertaken , on no occasion , to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it but have left them , as the constitution found them , under the direction and discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies . The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires . Endowed with the faculties and the rights of men , breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence , and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed , the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores without power to divert , or habits to contend against , they have been overwhelmed by the current , or driven before it now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter s state , humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence , and to prepare them in time for that state of society , which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals . We have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves . But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life , to induce them to exercise their reason , follow its dictates , and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances , have powerful obstacles to encounter they are combated by the habits of their bodies , prejudice of their minds , ignorance , pride , and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them , who feel themselves something in the present order of things , and fear to become nothing in any other . These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors that whatsoever they did , must be done through all time that reason is a false guide , and to advance under its counsel , in their physical , moral , or political condition , is perilous innovation that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them , ignorance being safety , and knowledge full of danger in short , my friends , among them is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and bigotry they , too , have their anti philosophers , who find an interest in keeping things in their present state , who dread reformation , and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendency of habit over the duty of improving our reason , and obeying its mandates . In giving these outlines , I do not mean , fellow citizens , to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures that is due , in the first place , to the reflecting character of our citizens at large , who , by the weight of public opinion , influence and strengthen the public measures it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected , who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws , the execution of which alone remains for others and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries , whose patriotism has associated with me in the executive functions . During this course of administration , and in order to disturb it , the artillery of the press has been levelled against us , charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare . These abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science , are deeply to be regretted , inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness , and to sap its safety they might , indeed , have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved and provided by the laws of the several States against falsehood and defamation but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants , and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation . Nor was it uninteresting to the world , that an experiment should be fairly and fully made , whether freedom of discussion , unaided by power , is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth whether a government , conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution , with zeal and purity , and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness , can be written down by falsehood and defamation . The experiment has been tried you have witnessed the scene our fellow citizens have looked on , cool and collected they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded they gathered around their public functionaries , and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage , they pronounced their verdict , honorable to those who had served them , and consolatory to the friend of man , who believes he may be intrusted with his own affairs . No inference is here intended , that the laws , provided by the State against false and defamatory publications , should not be enforced he who has time , renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity , in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law but the experiment is noted , to prove that , since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts , the press , confined to truth , needs no other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasonings and opinions , on a full hearing of all parties and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness . If there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain , its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion . Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally , as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course , I offer to our country sincere congratulations . With those , too , not yet rallied to the same point , the disposition to do so is gaining strength facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them and our doubting brethren will at length see , that the mass of their fellow citizens , with whom they cannot yet resolve to act , as to principles and measures , think as they think , and desire what they desire that our wish , as well as theirs , is , that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good , that peace be cultivated , civil and religious liberty unassailed , law and order preserved equality of rights maintained , and that state of property , equal or unequal , which results to every man from his own industry , or that of his fathers . When satisfied of these views , it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them in the meantime , let us cherish them with patient affection let us do them justice , and more than justice , in all competitions of interest and we need not doubt that truth , reason , and their own interests , will at length prevail , will gather them into the fold of their country , and will complete their entire union of opinion , which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony , and the benefit of all its strength . I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me , and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved . I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice but the weakness of human nature , and the limits of my own understanding , will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests . I shall need , therefore , all the indulgence I have heretofore experienced the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years . I shall need , too , the favor of that Being in whose hands we are , who led our forefathers , as Israel of old , from their native land , and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life who has covered our infancy with his providence , and our riper years with his wisdom and power and to whose goodness I ask you to join with me in supplications , that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants , guide their councils , and prosper their measures , that whatsoever they do , shall result in your good , and shall secure to you the peace , friendship , and approbation of all nations .<speech_sep>TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLEIt would have given me , fellow citizens , great satisfaction to announce in the moment of your meeting that the difficulties in our foreign relations , existing at the time of your last separation , had been amicably and justly terminated . I lost no time in taking those measures which were most likely to bring them to such a termination , by special missions charged with such powers and instructions as in the event of failure could leave no imputation on either our moderation or forbearance . The delays which have since taken place in our negotiations with the British government appears to have proceeded from causes which do not forbid the expectation that during the course of the session I may be enabled to lay before you their final issue . What will be that of the negotiations for settling our differences with Spain , nothing which had taken place at the date of the last despatches enables us to pronounce . On the western side of the Mississippi she advanced in considerable force , and took post at the settlement of Bayou Pierre , on the Red river . This village was originally settled by France , was held by her as long as she held Louisiana , and was delivered to Spain only as a part of Louisiana . Being small , insulated , and distant , it was not observed , at the moment of redelivery to France and the United States , that she continued a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed there . A proposition , however , having been lately made by our commander in chief , to assume the Sabine river as a temporary line of separation between the troops of the two nations until the issue of our negotiations shall be known this has been referred by the Spanish commandant to his superior , and in the meantime , he has withdrawn his force to the western side of the Sabine river . The correspondence on this subject , now communicated , will exhibit more particularly the present state of things in that quarter . The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted infantry . In order , therefore , that the commanding officer might be enabled to act with effect , I had authorized him to call on the governors of Orleans and Mississippi for a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry . The temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary . But I inform you with great pleasure of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of those territories have tendered their services in defence of their country . It has done honor to themselves , entitled them to the confidence of their fellow citizens in every part of the Union , and must strengthen the general determination to protect them efficaciously under all circumstances which may occur . Having received information that in another part of the United States a great number of private individuals were combining together , arming and organizing themselves contrary to law , to carry on military expeditions against the territories of Spain , I thought it necessary , by proclamations as well as by special orders , to take measures for preventing and suppressing this enterprise , for seizing the vessels , arms , and other means provided for it , and for arresting and bringing to justice its authors and abettors . It was due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transactions it was due to good order and regular government , that while the public force was acting strictly on the defensive and merely to protect our citizens from aggression , the criminal attempts of private individuals to decide for their country the question of peace or war , by commencing active and unauthorized hostilities , should be promptly and efficaciously suppressed . Whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will depend on the result of our negotiation with Spain but as it is uncertain when that result will be known , the provisional measures requisite for that , and to meet any pressure intervening in that quarter , will be a subject for your early consideration . The possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a single point the defence of that river , its waters , and the country adjacent , it becomes highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security . Some position above its mouth , commanding the passage of the river , should be rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessels which may be stationed there for defence , and in conjunction with them to present an insuperable obstacle to any force attempting to pass . The approaches to the city of New Orleans , from the eastern quarter also , will require to be examined , and more effectually guarded . For the internal support of the country , the encouragement of a strong settlement on the western side of the Mississippi , within reach of New Orleans , will be worthy the consideration of the legislature . The gun boats authorized by an act of the last session are so advanced that they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring . Circumstances permitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction . As a much larger number will still be wanting to place our seaport towns and waters in that state of defence to which we are competent and they entitled , a similar appropriation for a further provision for them is recommended for the ensuing year . A further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications already established , and the erection of such works as may have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our seaport towns , or their remaining before them . In a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people , directly expressed by their free suffrages where the principal executive functionaries , and those of the legislature , are renewed by them at short periods where under the characters of jurors , they exercise in person the greatest portion of the judiciary powers where the laws are consequently so formed and administered as to bear with equal weight and favor on all , restraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry , and securing to every one the property which that acquires , it would not be supposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection or enterprise on the public peace or authority . The laws , however , aware that these should not be trusted to moral restraints only , have wisely provided punishments for these crimes when committed . But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission Where an enterprise is meditated by private individuals against a foreign nation in amity with the United States , powers of prevention to a certain extent are given by the laws would they not be as reasonable and useful were the enterprise preparing against the United States While adverting to this branch of the law , it is proper to observe , that in enterprises meditated against foreign nations , the ordinary process of binding to the observance of the peace and good behavior , could it be extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the United States , would be effectual in some cases where the offender is able to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on him the exercise of the powers now given by law . The states on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to respect our peace and friendship with Tunis alone some uncertainty remains . Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on equal terms , or not at all , I propose to send in due time a reinforcement into the Mediterranean , unless previous information shall show it to be unnecessary . We continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian neighbors , and of their disposition to place all their interests under the patronage of the United States . These dispositions are inspired by their confidence in our justice , and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare and as long as we discharge these high and honorable functions with the integrity and good faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance , we may expect to reap the just reward in their peace and friendship . The expedition of Lewis and Clarke , for exploring the river Missouri , and the best communication from that to the Pacific ocean , has had all the success which could have been expected . They have traced the Missouri nearly to its source , descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean , ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across our continent , learned the character of the country , of its commerce , and inhabitants and it is but justice to say that Lewis and Clarke , and their brave companions , have by this arduous service deserved well of their country . The attempt to explore the Red river , under the direction of Freeman , though conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation , has not been equally successful . After proceeding up it about six hundred miles , nearly as far as the French settlements had extended while the country was in their possession , our geographers were obliged to return without completing their work . Very useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the Mississippi by Lieutenant Pike , who has ascended to its source , and whose journal and map , giving the details of the journey , will shortly be ready for communication to both houses of Congress . Those of Lewis and Clarke , and Freeman , will require further time to be digested and prepared . These important surveys , in addition to those before possessed , furnish materials for commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi , and its western waters . Some principal rivers , however , remain still to be explored , toward which the authorization of Congress , by moderate appropriations , will be requisite . I congratulate you , fellow citizens , on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally , to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa , and which the morality , the reputation , and the best interests of our country , have long been eager to proscribe . Although no law you may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight , yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent , by timely notice , expeditions which cannot be completed before that day . The receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last , have amounted to near fifteen millions of dollars , which have enabled us , after meeting the current demands , to pay two millions seven hundred thousand dollars of the American claims , in part of the price of Louisiana to pay of the funded debt upward of three millions of principal , and nearly four of interest and in addition , to reimburse , in the course of the present month , near two millions of five and a half per cent . stock . These payments and reimbursements of the funded debt , with those which have been made in the four years and a half preceding , will , at the close of the present year , have extinguished upwards of twenty three millions of principal . The duties composing the Mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of the present season . Considering , however , that they are levied chiefly on luxuries , and that we have an impost on salt , a necessary of life , the free use of which other wise is so important , I recommend to your consideration the suppression of the duties on salt , and the continuation of the Mediterranean fund , instead thereof , for a short time , after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation . When both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be relinquished , there will still ere long be an accumulation of moneys in the treasury beyond the instalments of public debt which we are permitted by contract to pay . They cannot , then , without a modification assented to by the public creditors , be applied to the extinguishment of this debt , and the complete liberation of our revenues the most desirable of all objects nor , if our peace continues , will they be wanting for any other existing purpose . The question , therefore , now comes forward , to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated , and the whole surplus of impost , after the entire discharge of the public debt , and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them Shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures On a few articles of more general and necessary use , the suppression in due season will doubtless be right , but the great mass of the articles on which impost is paid is foreign luxuries , purchased by those only who are rich enough to afford themselves the use of them . Their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education , roads , rivers , canals , and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers . By these operations new channels of communication will be opened between the States the lines of separation will disappear , their interests will be identified , and their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties . Education is here placed among the articles of public care , not that it would be proposed to take its ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprise , which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal but a public institution can alone supply those sciences which , though rarely called for , are yet necessary to complete the circle , all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the country , and some of them to its preservation . The subject is now proposed for the consideration of Congress , because , if approved by the time the State legislatures shall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts , and the laws shall be passed , and other arrangements made for their execution , the necessary funds will be on hand and without employment . I suppose an amendment to the constitution , by consent of the States , necessary , because the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution , and to which it permits the public moneys to be applied . The present consideration of a national establishment for education , particularly , is rendered proper by this circumstance also , that if Congress , approving the proposition , shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands , they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income . This foundation would have the advantage of being independent on war , which may suspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes the resources destined for them . This , fellow citizens , is the state of the public interest at the present moment , and according to the information now possessed . But such is the situation of the nations of Europe , and such too the predicament in which we stand with some of them , that we cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affairs that may change from moment to moment , during the course of your session or after you shall have separated . Our duty is , therefore , to act upon things as they are , and to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be . Were armies to be raised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon , we never should have been without them . Our resources would have been exhausted on dangers which have never happened , instead of being reserved for what is really to take place . A steady , perhaps a quickened pace in preparations for the defence of our seaport towns and waters an early settlement of the most exposed and vulnerable parts of our country a militia so organized that its effective portions can be called to any point in the Union , or volunteers instead of them to serve a sufficient time , are means which may always be ready yet never preying on our resources until actually called into use . They will maintain the public interests while a more permanent force shall be in course of preparation . But much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be brought into activity . If war be forced upon us in spite of our long and vain appeals to the justice of nations , rapid and vigorous movements in its outset will go far toward securing us in its course and issue , and toward throwing its burdens on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force . The result of our negotiations , or such incidents in their course as may enable us to infer their probable issue such further movements also on our western frontiers as may show whether war is to be pressed there while negotiation is protracted elsewhere , shall be communicated to you from time to time as they become known to me , with whatever other information I possess or may receive , which may aid your deliberations on the great national interests committed to your charge .<speech_sep>TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATEIt would have been a source , fellow citizens , of much gratification , if our last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that the belligerent nations , whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce , had become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their unrighteous edicts . That no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effect , I lost no time in availing myself of the act authorizing a suspension , in whole or in part , of the several embargo laws . Our ministers at London and Paris were instructed to explain to the respective governments there , our disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which the aggressions were originally founded , and open a way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all sides had been reluctantly obstructed . As each of those governments had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only , and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other , it was reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity of their profession , and for restoring to the commerce of the United States its legitimate freedom . The instructions to our ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified with reference to their different circumstances , and to the condition annexed by law to the executive power of suspension , requiring a degree of security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of the decrees of France . Instead of a pledge , therefore , of a suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such a repeal , it was presumed that a sufficient inducement might be found in other considerations , and particularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent , and a refusal by the other , in the relations between the other and the United States . To Great Britain , whose power on the ocean is so ascendant , it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly , that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the United States their trade would be opened with her , and remain shut to her enemy , in case of his failure to rescind his decrees also . From France no answer has been received , nor any indication that the requisite change in her decrees is contemplated . The favorable reception of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be doubted , as her orders of council had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the United States no longer to be pretended , but as the arrangement proposed , while it resisted the illegal decrees of France , involved , moreover , substantially , the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British orders . The arrangement has nevertheless been rejected . This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed , and no other event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive was authorized , it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it . We have the satisfaction , however , to reflect , that in return for the privations by the measure , and which our fellow citizens in general have borne with patriotism , it has had the important effects of saving our mariners and our vast mercantile property , as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called for by the occasion . It has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and firmness which govern our councils , and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws and the rights of their country , and has thus long frustrated those usurpations and spoliations which , if resisted , involve war if submitted to , sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence . Under a continuance of the belligerent measures which , in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals , overspread the ocean with danger , it will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best adapted to such a state of things and bringing with them , as they do , from every part of the Union , the sentiments of our constituents , my confidence is strengthened , that in forming this decision they will , with an unerring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation , weigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made . Nor should I do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens , if I did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen , whatever it may be , will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire . The documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce , with the instructions given to our ministers at London and Paris , are now laid before you . The communications made to Congress at their last session explained the posture in which the close of the discussion relating to the attack by a British ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake left a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility . Every view of what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the British government for redressing a wrong , which , the more it was investigated , appeared the more clearly to require what had not been provided for in the special mission . It is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose . On the contrary , it will be seen , in the documents laid before you , that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to and , moreover , that it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council . The instructions which had been given to our ministers at London with a view to facilitate , if necessary , the reparation claimed by the United States , are included in the documents communicated . Our relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material changes since your last session . The important negotiations with Spain , which had been alternately suspended and resumed , necessarily experience a pause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguished her internal situation . With the Barbary powers we continue in harmony , with the exception of an unjustifiable proceeding of the dey of Algiers toward our consul to that regency . Its character and circumstances are now laid before you , and will enable you to decide how far it may , either now or hereafter , call for any measures not within the limits of the executive authority . With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained . Some instances of individual wrong have , as at other times , taken place , but in nowise implicating the will of the nation . Beyond the Mississippi , the Iowas , the Sacs , and the Alabamas , have delivered up for trial and punishment individuals from among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the United States . On this side of the Mississippi , the Creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly persons of their tribe . And , generally , from a conviction that we consider them as part of ourselves , and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests , the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily is extending from the nearer to the more remote , and will amply requite us for the justice and friendship practised towards them . Husbandry and household manufacture are advancing among them , more rapidly with the southern than the northern tribes , from circumstances of soil and climate and one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee nation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship of the United States , and to be identified with us in laws and government , in such progressive manner as we shall think best . In consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for the security of our seaport towns and harbors , such works of defence have been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places , their relative importance , and the scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation . These works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season , except at New York and New Orleans , where most was to be done and although a great proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place , yet some further views will be submitted by Congress for rendering its security entirely adequate against naval enterprise . A view of what has been done at the several places , and of what is proposed to be done , shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received . Of the gun boats authorized by the act of December last , it has been thought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year . These , with those before possessed , are sufficient for the harbors and waters exposed , and the residue will require little time for their construction when it is deemed necessary . Under the act of the last session for raising an additional military force , so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying on the business of recruiting , and in proportion as it advanced , others have been added . We have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory , although such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present to you a statement of the numbers engaged . I have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call for any general detachments of militia or volunteers under the law passed for that purpose . For the ensuing season , however , they will require to be in readiness should their services be wanted . Some small and special detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion , but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of new recruits . By the aid of these , and of the armed vessels called into actual service in other quarters , the spirit of disobedience and abuse which manifested itself early , and with sensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it , has been considerably repressed . Considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live , our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country . For a people who are free , and who mean to remain so , a well organized and armed militia is their best security . It is , therefore , incumbent on us , at every meeting , to revise the condition of the militia , and to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed to invasion . Some of the States have paid a laudable attention to this object but every degree of neglect is to be found among others . Congress alone have power to produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence the interests which they so deeply feel in their own and their country s security will present this as among the most important objects of their deliberation . Under the acts of March 11th and April 23d , respecting arms , the difficulty of procuring them from abroad , during the present situation and dispositions of Europe , induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal supply . The public factories have , therefore , been enlarged , additional machineries erected , and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed , their effect , already more than doubled , may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia . The annual sums appropriated by the latter act , have been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms , and contracts have been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the amount of the first year s appropriation . The suspension of our foreign commerce , produced by the injustice of the belligerent powers , and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens , are subjects of just concern . The situation into which we have thus been forced , has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufactures and improvements . The extent of this conversion is daily increasing , and little doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming will under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence , the freedom of labor from taxation with us , and of protecting duties and prohibitions become permanent . The commerce with the Indians , too , within our own boundaries , is likely to receive abundant aliment from the same internal source , and will secure to them peace and the progress of civilization , undisturbed by practices hostile to both . The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending on the 30th day of September last , being not yet made up , a correct statement will hereafter be transmitted from the Treasury . In the meantime , it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen millions of dollars , which , with the eight millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of the year , have enabled us , after meeting the current demands and interest incurred , to pay two millions three hundred thousand dollars of the principal of our funded debt , and left us in the treasury , on that day , near fourteen millions of dollars . Of these , five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary to pay what will be due on the first day of January next , which will complete the reimbursement of the eight per cent . stock . These payments , with those made in the six years and a half preceding , will have extinguished thirty three millions five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the funded debt , being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and our contracts and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from about two millions of dollars of interest , and added that sum annually to the disposable surplus . The probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public debt , whenever the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restored , merits the consideration of Congress . Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults Shall the revenue be reduced Or shall it rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads , canals , rivers , education , and other great foundations of prosperity and union , under the powers which Congress may already possess , or such amendment of the constitution as may be approved by the States While uncertain of the course of things , the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement , should that be thought best . Availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing the two houses of the legislature at their meeting , I cannot omit the expression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence manifested to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration , and the many indulgences experienced at their hands . The same grateful acknowledgments are due to my fellow citizens generally , whose support has been my great encouragement under all embarrassments . In the transaction of their business I cannot have escaped error . It is incident to our imperfect nature . But I may say with truth , my errors have been of the understanding , not of intention and that the advancement of their rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure . On these considerations I solicit their indulgence . Looking forward with anxiety to their future destinies , I trust that , in their steady character unshaken by difficulties , in their love of liberty , obedience to law , and support of the public authorities , I see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our republic and retiring from the charge of their affairs , I carry with me the consolation of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our beloved country long ages to come of prosperity and happiness .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives As the continuance of the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes will be under the consideration of the Legislature at its present session , I think it my duty to communicate the views which have guided me in the execution of that act , in order that you may decide on the policy of continuing it in the present or any other form , or discontinue it altogether if that shall , on the whole , seem most for the public good . The Indian tribes residing within the limits of the United States have for a considerable time been growing more and more uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy , although effected by their own voluntary sales , and the policy has long been gaining strength with them of refusing absolutely all further sale on any conditions , insomuch that at this time it hazards their friendship and excites dangerous jealousies and perturbations in their minds to make any overture for the purchase of the smallest portions of their land . A very few tribes only are not yet obstinately in these dispositions . In order peaceably to counteract this policy of theirs and to provide an extension of territory which the rapid increase of our numbers will call for , two measures are deemed expedient . First . To encourage them to abandon hunting , to apply to the raising stock , to agriculture , and domestic manufacture , and thereby prove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain them in this better than in their former mode of living . The extensive forests necessary in the hunting life will then become useless , and they will see advantage in exchanging them for the means of improving their farms and of increasing their domestic comforts . Secondly . To multiply trading houses among them , and place within their reach those things which will contribute more to their domestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated wilds . Experience and reflection will develop to them the wisdom of exchanging what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and they want . In leading them thus to agriculture , to factures , and civilization in bringing together their and our sentiments , and in preparing them ultimately to participate in the benefits of our Government , I trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good . At these trading houses we have pursued the principles of the act of Congress which directs that the commerce shall be carried on liberally , and requires only that the capital stock shall not be diminished . We consequently undersell private traders , foreign and domestic , drive them from the competition , and thus , with the good will of the Indians , rid ourselves of a description of men who are constantly endeavoring to excite in the Indian mind suspicions , fears , and irritations toward us . A letter now inclosed shows the effect of our competition on the operations of the traders , while the Indians , perceiving the advantage of purchasing from us , are soliciting generally our establishment of trading houses among them . In one quarter this is particularly interesting . The Legislature , reflecting on the late occurrences on the Mississippi , must be sensible how desirable it is to possess a respectable breadth of country on that river , from our southern limit to the Illinois , at least , so that we may present as firm a front on that as on our eastern border . We possess what is below the Yazoo , and can probably acquire a certain breadth from the Illinois and Wabash to the Ohio but between the Ohio and Yazoo the country all belongs to the Chickasaws , the most friendly tribe within our limits , but the most decided against the alienation of lands . The portion of their country most important for us is exactly that which they do not inhabit . Their settlements are not on the Mississippi , but in the interior country . They have lately shown a desire to become agricultural , and this leads to the desire of buying implements and comforts . In the strengthening and gratifying of these wants I see the only prospect of planting on the Mississippi itself the means of its own safety . Duty has required me to submit these views to the judgment of the Legislature , but as their disclosure might embarrass and defeat their effect , they are committed to the special confidence of the two Houses . While the extension of the public commerce among the Indian tribes may deprive of that source of profit such of our citizens as are engaged in it , it might be worthy the attention of Congress in their care of individual as well as of the general interest to point in another direction the enterprise of these citizens , as profitably for themselves and more usefully for the public . The river Missouri and the Indians inhabiting it are not as well known as is rendered desirable by their connection with the Mississippi , and consequently with us . It is , however , understood that the country on that river is inhabited by numerous tribes , who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation , carried on in a high latitude through an infinite number of portages and lakes shut up by ice through a long season . The commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of the Missouri , traversing a moderate climate , offering , according to the best accounts , a continued navigation from its source , and possibly with a single portage from the Western Ocean , and finding to the Atlantic a choice of channels through the Illinois or Wabash , the Lakes and Hudson , through the Ohio and Susquehanna , or Potomac or James rivers , and through the Tennessee and Savannah rivers . An intelligent officer , with ten or twelve chosen men , fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it , taken from our posts where they may be spared without inconvenience , might explore the whole line , even to the Western Ocean , have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial intercourse , get admission among them for our traders as others are admitted , agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles , and return with the information acquired in the course of two summers . Their arms and accouterments , some instruments of observation , and light and cheap presents for the Indians would be all the apparatus they could carry , and with an expectation of a soldier s portion of land on their return would constitute the whole expense . Their pay would be going on whether here or there . While other civilized nations have encountered great expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking voyages of discovery , and for other literary purposes , in various parts and directions , our nation seems to owe to the same object , as well as to its own interests , to explore this the only line of easy communication across the continent , and so directly traversing our own part of it . The interests of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional powers and care of Congress , and that it should incidentally advance the geographical knowledge of our own continent can not but be an additional gratification . The nation claiming the territory , regarding this as a literary pursuit , which it is in the habit of permitting within its dominions , would not be disposed to view it with jealousy , even if the expiring state of its interests there did not render it a matter of indifference . The appropriation of 2 , 500 for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States , while understood and considered by the Executive as giving the legislative sanction , would cover the undertaking from notice and prevent the obstructions which interested individuals might otherwise previously prepare in its way .
