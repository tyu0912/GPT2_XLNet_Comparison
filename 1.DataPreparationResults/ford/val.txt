President , President Hurley , Senator Johnston , my good friends from the House of Representatives , Eddie Hebert , Dave Treen , Lindy Boggs , Lieutenant Governor Fitzmorris , students , faculty , alumni , and guests of Tulane University It is really a great privilege and a very high honor to have an opportunity of participating again in a student activity at Tulane University . And for this opportunity , I thank you very , very much . Each time that I have been privileged to visit Tulane , I have come away newly impressed with the intense application of the student body to the great issues of our time , and I am pleased tonight to observe that your interest has not changed one bit . As we came into the building tonight , I passed a student who looked up from his book and said , A journey of a thousand miles begins but with a single step . To indicate my interest in him , I asked , Are you trying to figure out how to get your goal in life He said , No , I am trying to figure out how to get to the Super Dome in September . Well , I do not think there is any doubt in my mind that all of you will get to the Super Dome . Of course , I hope it is to see the Green Wave have their very best season on the gridiron . I have sort of a feeling that you would not mind making this another year in which you put the Tigers in your tank . When I had the privilege of speaking here in 1968 at your Directions 68 forum , I had no idea that my own career and our entire Nation would move so soon in another direction . And I say again , I am extremely proud to be invited back . I am impressed , as I undoubtedly said before but I would reiterate it tonight by Tulane s unique distinction as the only American university to be converted from State sponsorship to private status . And I am also impressed by the Tulane graduates who serve in the United States Congress Bennett Johnston , Lindy Boggs , Dave Treen . Eddie Hebert , when I asked him the question whether he was or not , and he said he got a special degree Dropout 28 . But I think the fact that you have these three outstanding graduates testifies to the academic excellence and the inspiration of this historic university , rooted in the past with its eyes on the future . Just as Tulane has made a great transition from the past to the future , so has New Orleans , the legendary city that has made such a unique contribution to our great America . New Orleans is more , as I see it , than weathered bricks and cast iron balconies . It is a state of mind , a melting pot that represents the very , very best of America s evolution , an example of retention of a very special culture in a progressive environment of modern change . On January 8 , 1815 , a monumental American victory was achieved here the Battle of New Orleans . Louisiana had been a State for less than three years , but outnumbered Americans innovated , outnumbered Americans used the tactics of the frontier to defeat a veteran British force trained in the strategy of the Napoleonic wars . We as a nation had suffered humiliation and a measure of defeat in the War of 1812 . Our National Capital in Washington had been captured and burned . So , the illustrious victory in the Battle of New Orleans was a powerful restorative to our national pride . Yet , the victory at New Orleans actually took place two weeks after the signing of the armistice in Europe . Thousands died although a peace had been negotiated . The combatants had not gotten the word . Yet , the epic struggle nevertheless restored America s pride . Today , America can regain the sense of pride that existed before Vietnam . But it cannot be achieved by refighting a war that is finished as far as America is concerned . As I see it , the time has come to look forward to an agenda for the future , to unify , to bind up the Nation s wounds , and to restore its health and its optimistic self confidence . In New Orleans , a great battle was fought after a war was over . In New Orleans tonight , we can begin a great national reconciliation . The first engagement must be with the problems of today , but just as importantly , the problems of the future . That is why I think it is so appropriate that I find myself tonight at a university which addresses itself to preparing young people for the challenge of tomorrow . I ask that we stop refighting the battles and the recriminations of the past . I ask that we look now at what is right with America , at our possibilities and our potentialities for change and growth and achievement and sharing . I ask that we accept the responsibilities of leadership as a good neighbor to all peoples and the enemy of none . I ask that we strive to become , in the finest American tradition , something more tomorrow than we are today . Instead of my addressing the image of America , I prefer to consider the reality of America . It is true that we have launched our Bicentennial celebration without having achieved human perfection , but we have attained a very remarkable self governed society that possesses the flexibility and the dynamism to grow and undertake an entirely new agenda , an agenda for America s third century . So , I ask you to join me in helping to write that agenda . I am as determined as a President can be to seek national rediscovery of the belief in ourselves that characterized the most creative periods in our Nation s history . The greatest challenge of creativity , as I see it , lies ahead . We , of course , are saddened indeed by the events in Indochina . But these events , tragic as they are , portend neither the end of the world nor of America s leadership in the world . Let me put it this way , if I might . Some tend to feel that if we do not succeed in everything everywhere , then we have succeeded in nothing anywhere . I reject categorically such polarized thinking . We can and we should help others to help themselves . But the fate of responsible men and women everywhere , in the final decision , rests in their own hands , not in ours . America s future depends upon Americans especially your generation , which is now equipping itself to assume the challenges of the future , to help write the agenda for America . Earlier today , in this great community , I spoke about the need to maintain our defenses . Tonight , I would like to talk about another kind of strength , the true source of American power that transcends all of the deterrent powers for peace of our Armed Forces . I am speaking here of our belief in ourselves and our belief in our Nation . Abraham Lincoln asked , in his own words , and I quote , What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence And he answered , It is not our frowning battlements or bristling seacoasts , our Army or our Navy . Our defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as the heritage of all men , in all lands everywhere . It is in this spirit that we must now move beyond the discords of the past decade . It is in this spirit that I ask you to join me in writing an agenda for the future . I welcome your invitation particularly tonight , because I know it is at Tulane and other centers of thought throughout our great country that much consideration is being given to the kind of future Americans want and , just as importantly , will work for . Each of you are preparing yourselves for the future , and I am deeply interested in your preparations and your opinions and your goals . However , tonight , with your indulgence , let me share with you my own views . I envision a creative program that goes as far as our courage and our capacities can take us , both at home and abroad . My goal is for a cooperative world at peace , using its resources to build , not to destroy . As President , I am determined to offer leadership to overcome our current economic problems . My goal is for jobs for all who want to work and economic opportunity for all who want to achieve . I am determined to seek self sufficiency in energy as an urgent national priority . My goal is to make America independent of foreign energy sources by 1985 . Of course , I will pursue interdependence with other nations and a reformed international economic system . My goal is for a world in which consuming and producing nations achieve a working balance . I will address the humanitarian issues of hunger and famine , of health and of healing . My goal is to achieve or to assure basic needs and an effective system to achieve this result . I recognize the need for technology that enriches life while preserving our natural environment . My goal is to stimulate productivity , but use technology to redeem , not to destroy our environment . I will strive for new cooperation rather than conflict in the peaceful exploration of our oceans and our space . My goal is to use resources for peaceful progress rather than war and destruction . Let America symbolize humanity s struggle to conquer nature and master technology . The time has now come for our Government to facilitate the individual s control over his or her future and of the future of America . But the future requires more than Americans congratulating themselves on how much we know and how many products that we can produce . It requires new knowledge to meet new problems . We must not only be motivated to build a better America , we must know how to do it . If we really want a humane America that will , for instance , contribute to the alleviation of the world s hunger , we must realize that good intentions do not feed people . Some problems , as anyone who served in the Congress knows , are complex . There are no easy answers . Willpower alone does not grow food . We thought , in a well intentioned past , that we could export our technology lock , stock , and barrel to developing nations . We did it with the best of intentions . But we are now learning that a strain of rice that grows in one place will not grow in another that factories that produce at 100 percent in one nation produce less than half as much in a society where temperaments and work habits are somewhat different . Yet , the world economy has become interdependent . Not only food technology but money management , natural resources and energy , research and development all kinds of this group require an organized world society that makes the maximum effective use of the world s resources . I want to tell the world Let us grow food together , but let us also learn more about nutrition , about weather forecasting , about irrigation , about the many other specialties involved in helping people to help themselves . We must learn more about people , about the development of communities , architecture , engineering , education , motivation , productivity , public health and medicine , arts and sciences , political , legal , and social organization . All of these specialities and many , many more are required if young people like you are to help this Nation develop an agenda for our future your future , our country s future . I challenge , for example , the medical students in this audience to put on their agenda the achievement of a cure for cancer . I challenge the engineers in this audience to devise new techniques for developing cheap , clean , and plentiful energy , and as a byproduct , to control floods . I challenge the law students in this audience to find ways to speed the administration of equal justice and make good citizens out of convicted criminals . I challenge education , those of you as education majors , to do real teaching for real life . I challenge the arts majors in this audience to compose the great American symphony , to write the great American novel , and to enrich and inspire our daily lives . America s leadership is essential . America s resources are vast . America s opportunities are unprecedented . As we strive together to prefect a new agenda , I put high on the list of important points the maintenance of alliances and partnerships with other people and other nations . These do provide a basis of shared values , even as we stand up with determination for what we believe . This , of course , requires a continuing commitment to peace and a determination to use our good offices wherever possible to promote better relations between nations of this world . The new agenda , that which is developed by you and by us , must place a high priority on the need to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to work for the mutual reduction in strategic arms and control of other weapons . And I must say , parenthetically , the successful negotiations at Vladivostok , in my opinion , are just a beginning . Your generation of Americans is uniquely endowed by history to give new meaning to the pride and spirit of America . The magnetism of an American society , confident of its own strength , will attract the good will and the esteem of all people wherever they might be in this globe in which we live . It will enhance our own perception of ourselves and our pride in being an American . We can , we can and I say it with emphasis write a new agenda for our future . I am glad that Tulane University and other great American educational institutions are reaching out to others in programs to work with developing nations , and I look forward with confidence to your participation in every aspect of America s future . And I urge Americans of all ages to unite in this Bicentennial year , to take responsibility for themselves as our ancestors did . Let us resolve tonight to rediscover the old virtues of confidence and stir reliance and capability that characterized our forefathers two centuries ago . I pledge , as I know you do , each one of us , to do our part . Let the beacon light of the past shine forth from historic New Orleans and from Tulane University and from every other corner of this land to illuminate a boundless future for all Americans and a peace for all mankind . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Chairman , my distinguished colleagues May I begin by expressing to the Governments of Finland and Switzerland , which have been superb hosts for the several phases of this Conference , my gratitude and that of my associates for their efficiency and hospitality . Particularly to you , President Kekkonen , I must convey to the people of the Republic of Finland , on behalf of the 214 million people of the United States of America , a reaffirmation of the longstanding affection and admiration which all my countrymen hold for your brave and beautiful land . We are bound together by the most powerful of all ties , our fervent love for freedom and independence , which knows no homeland but the human heart . It is a sentiment as enduring as the granite rock on which this city stands and as moving as the music of Sibelius . Our visit here , though short , has brought us a deeper appreciation of the pride , industry , and friendliness which Americans always associate with the Finnish nation . The nations assembled here have kept the general peace in Europe for 30 years . Yet there have been too many narrow escapes from major conflict . There remains , to this day , the urgent issue of how to construct a just and lasting peace for all peoples . I have not come across the Atlantic to say what all of us already know that nations now have the capacity to destroy civilization and , therefore , all our foreign policies must have as their one supreme objective the prevention of a thermonuclear war . Nor have I come to dwell upon the hard realities of continuing ideological differences , political rivalries , and military competition that persist among us . I have come to Helsinki as a spokesman for a nation whose vision has always been forward , whose people have always demanded that the future be brighter than the past , and whose united will and purpose at this hour is to work diligently to promote peace and progress not only for ourselves but for all mankind . I am simply here to say to my colleagues We owe it to our children , to the children of all continents , not to miss any opportunity , not to malinger for one minute , not to spare ourselves or allow others to shirk in the monumental task of building a better and a safer world . The American people , like the people of Europe , know well that mere assertions of good will , passing changes in the political mood of governments , laudable declarations of principles are not enough . But if we proceed with care , with commitment to real progress , there is now an opportunity to turn our peoples hopes into realities . In recent years , nations represented here have sought to ease potential conflicts . But much more remains to be done before we prematurely congratulate ourselves . Military competition must be controlled . Political competition must be restrained . Crises must not be manipulated or exploited for unilateral advantages that could lead us again to the brink of war . The process of negotiation must be sustained , not at a snail s pace , but with demonstrated enthusiasm and visible progress . Nowhere are the challenges and the opportunities greater and more evident than in Europe . That is why this Conference brings us all together . Conflict in Europe shakes the world . Twice in this century we have paid dearly for this lesson at other times , we have come perilously close to calamity . We dare not forget the tragedy and the terror of those times . Peace is not a piece of paper . But lasting peace is at least possible today because we have learned from the experiences of the last 30 years that peace is a process requiring mutual restraint and practical arrangements . This Conference is a part of that process a challenge , not a conclusion . We face unresolved problems of military security in Europe we face them with very real differences in values and in aims . But if we deal with them with careful preparation , if we focus on concrete issues , if we maintain forward movement , we have the right to expect real progress . The era of confrontation that has divided Europe since the end of the Second World War may now be ending . There is a new perception and a shared perception of a change for the better , away from confrontation and toward new possibilities for secure and mutually beneficial cooperation . That is what we all have been saying here . I welcome and I share these hopes for the future . The postwar policy of the United States has been consistently directed toward the rebuilding of Europe and the rebirth of Europe s historic identity . The nations of the West have worked together for peace and progress throughout Europe . From the very start , we have taken the initiative by stating clear goals and areas for negotiation . We have sought a structure of European relations , tempering rivalry with restraint , power with moderation , building upon the traditional bonds that link us with old friends and reaching out to forge new ties with former and potential adversaries . In recent years , there have been some substantial achievements . We see the Four Power Agreement on Berlin of 1971 as the end of a perennial crisis that on at least three occasions brought the world to the brink of doom . The agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and the states of Eastern Europe and the related intra German accords enable Central Europe and the world to breathe easier . The start of East West talks on mutual and balanced force reductions demonstrate a determination to deal with military security problems of the continent . The 1972 treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union to limit antiballistic missiles and the interim agreement limiting strategic offensive arms were the first solid breakthroughs in what must be a continuing , long term process of limiting strategic nuclear arsenals . I profoundly hope that this Conference will spur further practical and concrete results . It affords a welcome opportunity to widen the circle of those countries involved in easing tensions between East and West . Participation in the work of detente and participation in the benefits of detente must be everybody s business in Europe and elsewhere . But detente can succeed only if everybody understands what detente actually is . First , detente is an evolutionary process , not a static condition . Many formidable challenges yet remain . Second , the success of detente , of the process of detente , depends on new behavior patterns that give life to all our solemn declarations . The goals we are stating today are the yardstick by which our performance will be measured . The people of all Europe and , I assure you , the people of North America are thoroughly tired of having their hopes raised and then shattered by empty words and unfulfilled pledges . We had better say what we mean and mean what we say , or we will have the anger of our citizens to answer . While we must not expect miracles , we can and we do expect steady progress that comes in steps steps that are related to each other that link our actions with words in various areas of our relations . Finally , there must be an acceptance of mutual obligation . Detente , as I have often said , must be a two way street . Tensions cannot be eased by one side alone . Both sides must want detente and work to achieve it . Both sides must benefit from it . Chairman , my colleagues , this extraordinary gathering in Helsinki proves that all our peoples share a concern for Europe s future and for a better and more peaceful world . But what else does it prove How shall we assess the results Our delegations have worked long and hard to produce documents which restate noble and praiseworthy political principles . They spell out guidelines for national behavior and international cooperation . But every signatory should know that if these are to be more than the latest chapter in a long and sorry volume of unfulfilled declarations , every party must be dedicated to making them come true . These documents which we will sign represent another step how long or short a step only time will tell in the process of detente and reconcilation in Europe . Our peoples will be watching and measuring our progress . They will ask how these noble sentiments are being translated into actions that bring about a more secure and just order in the daily lives of each of our nations and its citizens . The documents produced here represent compromises , like all international negotiations , but these principles we have agreed upon are more than the lowest common denominator of governmental positions . They affirm the most fundamental human rights liberty of thought , conscience , and faith the exercise of civil and political rights the rights of minorities . They call for a freer flow of information , ideas , and people greater scope for the press , cultural and educational exchange , family reunification , the right to travel and to marriage between nationals of different states and for the protection of the priceless heritage of our diverse cultures . They offer wide areas for greater cooperation trade , industrial production , science and technology , the environment , transportation , health , space , and the oceans . They reaffirm the basic principles of relations between states nonintervention , sovereign equality , self determination , territorial integrity , inviolability of frontiers , and the possibility of change by peaceful means . The United States gladly subscribes to this document because we subscribe to every one of these principles . Almost 200 years ago , the United States of America was born as a free and independent nation . The descendants of Europeans who proclaimed their independence in America expressed in that declaration a decent respect for the opinions of mankind and asserted not only that all men are created equal but they are endowed with inalienable rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . The founders of my country did not merely say that all Americans should have these rights but all men everywhere should have these rights . And these principles have guided the United States of America throughout its two centuries of nationhood . They have given hopes to millions in Europe and on every continent . I have been asked why I am here today . I am here because I believe , and my countrymen believe , in the interdependence of Europe and North America indeed in the interdependence of the entire family of man . I am here because the leaders of 34 other governments are here the states of Europe and of our good neighbor , Canada , with whom we share an open border of 5 , 526 miles , along which there stands not a single armed soldier and across which our two peoples have moved in friendship and mutual respect for 160 years . I can say without fear of contradiction that there is not a single people represented here whose blood does not flow in the veins of Americans and whose culture and traditions have not enriched the heritage which we Americans prize so highly . When two centuries ago the United States of America issued a declaration of high principles , the cynics and doubters of that day jeered and scoffed . Yet 11 long years later , our independence was won and the stability of our Republic was really achieved through the incorporation of the same principles in our Constitution . But those principles , though they are still being perfected , remain the guiding lights of an American policy . And the American people are still dedicated , as they were then , to a decent respect for the opinions of mankind and to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness for all peoples everywhere . To our fellow participants in this Conference My presence here symbolizes my country s vital interest in Europe s future . Our future is bound with yours . Our economic well being , as well as our security , is linked increasingly with yours . The distance of geography is bridged by our common heritage and our common destiny . The United States , therefore , intends to participate fully in the affairs of Europe and in turning the results of this Conference into a living reality . To America s allies We in the West must vigorously pursue the course upon which we have embarked together , reinforced by one another s strength and mutual confidence . Stability in Europe requires equilibrium in Europe . Therefore , I assure you that my country will continue to be a concerned and reliable partner . Our partnership is far more than a matter of formal agreements . It is a reflection of beliefs , traditions , and ties that are of deep significance to the American people . We are proud that these values are expressed in this document . To the countries of the East The United States considers that the principles on which this Conference has agreed are a part of the great heritage of European civilization , which we all hold in trust for all mankind . To my country , they are not cliches or empty phrases . We take this work and these words very seriously . We will spare no effort to ease tensions and to solve problems between us . But it is important that you recognize the deep devotion of the American people and their Government to human rights and fundamental freedoms and thus to the pledges that this Conference has made regarding the freer movement of people , ideas , information . In building a political relationship between East and West , we face many challenges . Berlin has a special significance . It has been a flashpoint of confrontation in the past it can provide an example of peaceful settlement in the future . The United States regards it as a test of detente and of the principles of this Conference . We welcome the fact that , subject to Four Power rights and responsibilities , the results of CSCE apply to Berlin as they do throughout Europe . Military stability in Europe has kept the peace . While maintaining that stability , it is now time to reduce substantially the high levels of military forces on both sides . Negotiations now underway in Vienna on mutual and balanced force reductions so far have not produced the results for which I had hoped . The United States stands ready to demonstrate flexibility in moving these negotiations forward , if others will do the same . An agreement that enhances mutual security is feasible and essential . The United States also intends to pursue vigorously a further agreement on strategic arms limitations with the Soviet Union . This remains a priority of American policy . General Secretary Brezhnev and I agreed last November in Vladivostok on the essentials of a new accord limiting strategic offensive weapons for the next 10 years . We are moving forward in our bilateral discussions here in Helsinki . The world faces an unprecedented danger in the spread of nuclear weapons technology . The nations of Europe share a great responsibility for an international solution to this problem . The benefits of peaceful nuclear energy are becoming more and more important . We must find ways to spread these benefits while safeguarding the world against the menace of weapons proliferation . To the other nations of Europe represented at this Conference We value the work you have done here to help bring all of Europe together . Your right to live in peace and independence is one of the major goals of our effort . Your continuing contribution will be indispensable . To those nations not participating and to all the peoples of the world The solemn obligation undertaken in these documents to promote fundamental rights , economic and social progress , and well being applies ultimately to all peoples . Can we truly speak of peace and security without addressing the spread of nuclear weapons in the world or the creation of more sophisticated forms of warfare Can peace be divisible between areas of tranquillity and regions of conflict Can Europe truly flourish if we do not all address ourselves to the evil of hunger in countries less fortunate than we To the new dimensions of economic and energy issues that underline our own progress To the dialog between producers and consumers , between exporters and importers , between industrial countries and less developed ones And can there be stability and progress in the absence of justice and fundamental freedoms Our people want a better future . Their expectations have been raised by the very real steps that have already been taken in arms control , political negotiations , and expansion of contacts and economic relations . Our presence here offers them further hope . We must not let them down . If the Soviet Union and the United States can reach agreement so that our astronauts can fit together the most intricate scientific equipment , work together , and shake hands 137 miles out in space , we as statesmen have an obligation to do as well on Earth . History will judge this Conference not by what we say here today , but by what we do tomorrow not by the promises we make , but by the promises we keep . Thank you very much , Chairman .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of the 94th Congress , and distinguished guests As we begin our Bicentennial , America is still one of the youngest nations in recorded history . Long before our forefathers came to these shores , men and women had been struggling on this planet to forge a better life for themselves and their families . In man s long , upward march from savagery and slavery throughout the nearly 2 , 000 years of the Christian calendar , the nearly 6 , 000 years of Jewish reckoning there have been many deep , terrifying valleys , but also many bright and towering peaks . One peak stands highest in the ranges of human history . One example shines forth of a people uniting to produce abundance and to share the good life fairly and with freedom . One union holds out the promise of justice and opportunity for every citizen That union is the United States of America . We have not remade paradise on Earth . We know perfection will not be found here . But think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years . We came from many roots , and we have many branches . Yet all Americans across the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of 1776 , those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge among our shores , say in unison I am proud of America , and I am proud to be an American . Life will be a little better here for my children than for me . I believe this not because I am told to believe it , but because life has been better for me than it was for my father and my mother . I know it will be better for my children because my hands , my brains , my voice , and my vote can help make it happen . It has happened here in America . It has happened to you and to me . Government exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can translate their ideas into practical reality . In the best of times , much is lost in translation . But we try . Sometimes we have tried and failed . Always we have had the best of intentions . But in the recent past , we sometimes forgot the sound principles that guided us through most of our history . We wanted to accomplish great things and solve age old problems . And we became overconfident of our abilities . We tried to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home . We thought we could transform the country through massive national programs , but often the programs did not work . Too often they only made things worse . In our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly , we trampled on sound principles of restraint and endangered the rights of individuals . We unbalanced our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of federal expenditures and borrowing . And we were not totally honest with ourselves about how much these programs would cost and how we would pay for them . Finally , we shifted our emphasis from defense to domestic problems while our adversaries continued a massive buildup of arms . The time has now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new realism that is true to the great principles upon which this nation was founded . We must introduce a new balance to our economy a balance that favors not only sound , active government but also a much more vigorous , healthy economy that can create new jobs and hold down prices . We must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government a balance that favors greater individual freedom and self reliance . We must strike a new balance in our system of federalism a balance that favors greater responsibility and freedom for the leaders of our state and local governments . We must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic programs and spending on defense a balance that ensures we will fully meet our obligation to the needy while also protecting our security in a world that is still hostile to freedom . And in all that we do , we must be more honest with the American people , promising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we promise . The genius of America has been its incredible ability to improve the lives of its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity . History and experience tells us that moral progress cannot come in comfortable and in complacent times , but out of trial and out of confusion . Tom Paine aroused the troubled Americans of 1776 to stand up to the times that try men s souls because the harder the conflict , the more glorious the triumph . Just a year ago I reported that the state of the Union was not good . Tonight , I report that the state of our Union is better in many ways a lot better but still not good enough . To paraphrase Tom Paine , 1975 was not a year for summer soldiers and sum shine patriots . It was a year of fears and alarms and of dire forecasts most of which never happened and will not happen . As you recall , the year 1975 opened with rancor and with bitterness . Political misdeeds of the past had neither been forgotten nor forgiven . The longest , most divisive war in our history was winding toward an unhappy conclusion . Many feared that the end of that foreign war of men and machines meant the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and reprisal . Friends and adversaries abroad were asking whether America had lost its nerve . Finally , our economy was ravaged by inflation inflation that was plunging us into the worse recession in four decades . At the same time , Americans became increasingly alienated from big institutions . They were steadily losing confidence , not just in big government but in big business , big labor , and big education , among others . Ours was a troubled land . And so , 1975 was a year of hard decisions , difficult compromises , and a new realism that taught us something important about America . It brought back a needed measure of common sense , steadfastness , and self discipline . Americans did not panic or demand instant but useless cures . In all sectors , people met their difficult problems with the restraint and with responsibility worthy of their great heritage . Add up the separate pieces of progress in 1975 , subtract the setbacks , and the sum total shows that we are not only headed in a new direction , a direction which I proposed 12 months ago , but it turned out to be the right direction . It is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary American concept of 1776 , which holds that in a free society the making of public policy and successful problemsolving involves much more than government . It involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government , private institutions , and individual citizens . Common sense tells me to stick to that steady course . Take the state of our economy . Last January , most things were rapidly getting worse . This January , most things are slowly but surely getting better . The worst recession since World War II turned around in April . The best cost of living news of the past year is that double digit inflation of 12 percent or higher was cut almost in half . The worst unemployment remains far too high . Today , nearly 1 , 700 , 000 more Americans are working than at the bottom of the recession . At year s end , people were again being hired much faster than they were being laid off . Yet , let us be honest . Many Americans have not yet felt these changes in their daily lives . They still see prices going up far too fast , and they still know the fear of unemployment . We are also a growing nation . We need more and more jobs every year . Today s economy has produced over 85 million jobs for Americans , but we need a lot more jobs , especially for the young . My first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation . We all know from recent experience what runaway inflation does to ruin every other worthy purpose . We are slowing it . We must stop it cold . For many Americans , the way to a healthy , noninflationary economy has become increasingly apparent . The government must stop spending so much and stop borrowing so much of our money . More money must remain in private hands where it will do the most good . To hold down the cost of living , we must hold down the cost of government . In the past decade , the federal budget has been growing at an average rate of over 10 percent a year . The budget I am submitting Wednesday cuts this rate of growth in half . I have kept my promise to submit a budget for the next fiscal year of 395 billion . In fact , it is 394 . 2 billion . By holding down the growth of federal spending , we can afford additional tax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking power over their own lives . Last month I signed legislation to extend the 1975 tax reductions for the first six months of this year . I now propose that effective July 1 , 1976 , we give our taxpayers a tax cut of approximately 10 billion more than Congress agreed to in December . My broader tax reduction would mean that for a family of four making 15 , 000 a year , there will be 227 more in take home pay annually . Hardworking Americans caught in the middle can really use that kind of extra cash . My recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of federal spending and for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward . For every dollar saved in cutting the growth in the federal budget , we can have an added dollar of federal tax reduction . We can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of federal spending . One test of a healthy economy is a job for every American who wants to work . Government our kind of government cannot create that many jobs . But the federal government can create conditions and incentives for private business and industry to make more and more jobs . Five out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in industry . Common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs and to find them faster . I mean real , rewarding , permanent jobs . To achieve this we must offer the American people greater incentives to invest in the future . My tax proposals are a major step in that direction . To supplement these proposals , I ask that Congress enact changes in federal tax laws that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new equipment . My recommendations will concentrate this job creation tax incentive in areas where the unemployment rate now runs over 7 percent . Legislation to get this started must be approved at the earliest possible date . Within the strict budget total that I will recommend for the coming year , I will ask for additional housing assistance for 500 , 000 families . These programs will expand housing opportunities , spur construction , and help to house moderate and low income families . We had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975 . But with lower interest rates and available mortgage money , we can have a healthy recovery in 1976 . A necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty tyranny of massive government regulation . We are wasting literally millions of working hours costing billions of taxpayers and consumers dollars because of bureaucratic redtape . The American farmer , who now feeds 215 million Americans , but also millions worldwide , has shown how touch more he can produce without the shackles of government control . Now , we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy the airlines , trucking , railroads , and financial institutions . I have submitted concrete plans in each of these areas , not to help this or that industry , but to foster competition and to bring prices down for the consumer . This administration , in addition , will strictly enforce the federal antitrust laws for the very same purposes . Taking a longer look at America s future , there can be neither sustained growth nor more jobs unless we continue to have an assured supply of energy to run our economy . Domestic production of oil and gas is still declining . Our dependence on foreign oil at high prices is still too great , draining jobs and dollars away from our own economy at the rate of 125 per year for every American . Last month , I signed a compromise national energy bill which enacts a part of my comprehensive energy independence program . This legislation was late , not the complete answer to energy independence , but still a start in the right direction . I again urge the Congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my energy proposals to make America invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel . My proposals , as all of you know , would reduce domestic natural gas shortages allow production from federal petroleum reserves stimulate effective conservation , including revitalization of our railroads and the expansion of our urban transportation systems develop more and cleaner energy from our vast coal resources expedite clean and safe nuclear power production create a new national energy independence authority to stimulate vital energy investment and accelerate development of technology to capture energy from the sun and the Earth for this and future generations . Also , I ask , for the sake of future generations , that we preserve the family farm and family owned small business . Both strengthen America and give stability to our economy . I will propose estate tax changes so that family businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to generation without having to be sold to pay taxes . I propose tax changes to encourage people to invest in America s future , and their own , through a plan that gives moderate income families income tax benefits if they make long term investments in common stock in American companies . The federal government must and will respond to clear cut national needs for this and future generations . Hospital and medical services in America are among the best in the world , but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a family s lifetime savings . Increasing health costs are of deep concern to all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living . The burden of catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society . We must eliminate this fear from every family . I propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by Medicare . To finance this added protection , fees for short term care will go up somewhat , but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than 500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care , nor more than 250 for one year s doctor bills . We cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans . The experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of such plans . But I do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer more middle income families high quality health services at prices they can afford and shield them also from their catastrophic illnesses . Using resources now available , I propose improving the Medicare and other federal health programs to help those who really need protection older people and the poor . To help states and local governments give better health care to the poor , I propose that we combine 16 existing federal programs , including Medicaid , into a single 10 billion federal grant . Funds would be divided among states under a new formula which provides a larger share of federal money to those states that have a larger share of low income families . I will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for those who have served in our armed forces . Now let me speak about social security . Our federal social security system for people who have worked and contributed to it for all their lives is a vital part of our economic system . Its value is no longer debatable . In my budget for fiscal year 1977 , I am recommending that the full cost of living increases in the social security benefits be paid during the coming year . But I am concerned about the integrity of our Social Security Trust Fund that enables people those retired and those still working who will retire to count on this source of retirement income . Younger workers watch their deductions rise and wonder if they will be adequately protected in the future . We must meet this challenge head on . Simple arithmetic warns all of us that the Social Security Trust Fund is headed for trouble . Unless we act soon to make sure the fund takes in as much as it pays out , there will be no security for old or for young . I must , therefore , recommend a three tenths of 1 percent increase in both employer and employee social security taxes effective January 1 , 1977 . This will cost each covered employee less than one extra dollar a week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund . As we rebuild our economy , we have a continuing responsibility to provide a temporary cushion to the unemployed . At my request , the Congress enacted two extensions and two expansions in unemployment insurance which helped those who were jobless during 1975 . These programs will continue in 1976 . In my fiscal year 1977 budget , I am also requesting funds to continue proven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of other Americans . Compassion and a sense of community two of America s greatest strengths throughout our history tell us we must take care of our neighbors who cannot take care of themselves . The host of federal programs in this field reflect our generosity as a people . But everyone realizes that when it comes to welfare , government at all levels is not doing the job well . Too many of our welfare programs are inequitable and invite abuse . Too many of our welfare programs have problems from beginning to end . Worse , we are wasting badly needed resources without reaching many of the truly needy . Complex welfare programs cannot be reformed overnight . Surely we cannot simply dump welfare into the laps of the 50 states , their local taxpayers , or their private charities , and just walk away from it . Nor is it the right time for massive and sweeping changes while we are still recovering from the recession . Nevertheless , there are still plenty of improvements that we can make . I will ask Congress for Presidential authority to tighten up the rules for eligibility and benefits . Last year I twice sought long overdue reform of the scandal riddled food stamp program . This year I say again Let us give food stamps to those most in need . Let us not give any to those who do not need them . Protecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the responsibility of all public officials , but is primarily the job of local and state law enforcement authorities . Americans have always found the very thought of a federal police force repugnant , and so do But there are proper ways in which we can help to insure domestic tranquility as the Constitution charges us . My recommendations on how to control violent crime were submitted to the Congress last June with strong emphasis on protecting the innocent victims of crime . To keep a convicted criminal from committing more crimes , we must put him in prison so he cannot harm more law abiding citizens . To be effective , this punishment must be swift and it must be certain . Too often , criminals are not sent to prison after conviction but are allowed to return to the streets . Some judges are reluctant to send convicted criminals to prison because of inadequate facilities . To alleviate this problem at the federal level , my new budget proposes the construction of four new federal facilities . To speed federal justice , I propose an increase this year in the United States attorneys prosecuting federal crimes and the reinforcement of the number of United States marshals . Additional federal judges are needed , as recommended by me and the Judicial Conference . Another major threat to every American s person and property is the criminal carrying a handgun . The way to cut down on the criminal use of guns is not to take guns away from the law abiding citizen , but to impose mandatory sentences for crimes in which a gun is used , make it harder to obtain cheap guns for criminal purposes , and concentrate gun control enforcement in highcrime areas . My budget recommends 500 additional federal agents in the 11 largest metropolitan high crime areas to help local authorities stop criminals from selling and using handguns . The sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again . I have directed all agencies of the federal government to step up law enforcement efforts against those who deal in drugs . In 1975 , I am glad to report , federal agents seized substantially more heroin coming into our country than in 1974 . As President , I have talked personally with the leaders of Mexico , Colombia , and Turkey to urge greater efforts by their governments to control effectively the production and shipment of hard drugs . I recommended months ago that the Congress enact mandatory fixed sentences for persons convicted of federal crimes involving the sale of hard drugs . Hard drugs , we all know , degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of their users . It is unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the federal government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime . Under the Constitution , the greatest responsibility for curbing crime lies with state and local authorities . They are the frontline fighters in the war against crime . There are definite ways in which the federal government can help them . I will propose in the new budget that Congress authorize almost 7 billion over the next five years to assist state and local governments to protect the safety and property of all their citizens . As President , I pledge the strict enforcement of federal laws and by example , support , and leadership to help state and local authorities enforce their laws . Together , we must protect the victims of crime and ensure domestic tranquility . Last year I strongly recommended a five year extension of the existing revenue sharing legislation , which thus far has provided 23 billion to help state and local units of government solve problems at home . This program has been effective with decisionmaking transferred from the federal government to locally elected officials . Congress must act this year , or state and local units of government will have to drop programs or raise local taxes . Including my health care program reforms , I propose to consolidate some 59 separate federal programs and provide flexible federal dollar grants to help states , cities , and local agencies in such important areas as education , child nutrition , and social services . This flexible system will do the job better and do it closer to home . The protection of the lives and property of Americans from foreign enemies is one of my primary responsibilities as President . In a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic missiles , in a world economy that is global and interdependent , our relations with other nations become more , not less , important to the lives of Americans . America has had a unique role in the world since the day of our independence 200 years ago . And ever since the end of World War Iwe have borne successfully a heavy responsibility for ensuring a stable world order and hope for human progress . Today , the state of our foreign policy is sound and strong . We are at peace , and I will do all in my power to keep it that way . Our military forces are capable and ready . Our military power is without equal , and I intend to keep it that way . Our principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the Atlantic community and Japan have never been more solid . A further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved . We have an improving relationship with China , the world s most populous nation . The key elements for peace among the nations of the Middle East now exist . Our traditional friendships in Latin America , Africa , and Asia continue . We have taken the role of leadership in launching a serious and hopeful dialog between the industrial world and the developing world . We have helped to achieve significant reform of the international monetary system . We should be proud of what America , what our country , has accomplished in these areas , and I believe the American people are . The American people have heard too much about how terrible our mistakes , how evil our deeds , and how misguided our purposes . The American people know better . The truth is we are the world s greatest democracy . We remain the symbol of man s aspiration for liberty and well being . We are the embodiment of hope for progress . I say it is time we quit downgrading ourselves as a nation . Of course , it is our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistakes . It is our duty to see that they never happen again . But our greater duty is to look to the future . The world s troubles will not go away . The American people want strong and effective international and defense policies . In our constitutional system , these policies should reflect consultation and accommodation between the President and the Congress . But in the final analysis , as the framers of our Constitution knew from hard experience , the foreign relations of the United States can be conducted effectively only if there is strong central direction that allows flexibility of action . That responsibility clearly rests with the President . I pledge to the American people policies which seek a secure , just , and peaceful world . I pledge to the Congress to work with you to that end . We must not face a future in which we can no longer help our friends , such as Angola , even in limited and carefully controlled ways . We must not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention . Some hasty actions of the Congress during the past year most recently in respect to Angola were , in my view , very shortsighted . Unfortunately , they are still very much on the minds of our allies and our adversaries . A strong defense posture gives weight to our values and our views in international negotiations . It assures the vigor of our alliances . And it sustains our efforts to promote settlements of international conflicts . Only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arms . Only a balanced agreement will serve our interests and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation . The defense budget I will submit to the Congress for fiscal year 1977 will show an essential increase over the current year . It provides for real growth in purchasing power over this year s defense budget , which includes the cost of the all volunteer force . We are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our military forces . But the budget I will submit represents the necessity of American strength for the real world in which we live . As conflict and rivalry persist in the world , our United States intelligence capabilities must be the best in the world . The crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger of American involvement in direct armed conflict . Our adversaries are encouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor events and to influence events short of military action is undermined . Without effective intelligence capability , the United States stands blindfolded and hobbled . In the near future , I will take actions to reform and strengthen our intelligence community . I ask for your positive cooperation . It is time to go beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective , responsible , and responsive intelligence capability . Tonight I have spoken about our problems at home and abroad . I have recommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century . I have no doubt that our Union will endure , better , stronger , and with more individual freedom . We can see forward only dimly one year , five years , a generation perhaps . Like our forefathers , we know that if we meet the challenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction , if we remain true to our Constitution and to our ideals , then we can know that the future will be better than the past . I see America today crossing a threshold , not just because it is our Bicentennial but because we have been tested in adversity . We have taken a new look at what we want to be and what we want our nation to become . I see America resurgent , certain once again that life will be better for our children than it is for us , seeking strength that cannot be counted in megatons and riches that cannot be eroded by inflation . I see these United States of America moving forward as before toward a more perfect Union where the government serves and the people rule . We will not make this happen simply by making speeches , good or bad , yours or mine , but by hard work and hard decisions made with courage and with common sense . I have heard many inspiring Presidential speeches , but the words I remember best were spoken by Dwight Eisenhower . America is not good because it is great , the President said . America is great because it is good . President Eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the heart of America . His simple words echoed President Lincoln s eloquent testament that right makes might . And Lincoln in turn evoked the silent image of George Washington kneeling in prayer at Valley Forge . So , all these magic memories which link eight generations of Americans are summed up in the inscription just above me . How many times have we seen it In God We Trust . Let us engrave it now in each of our hearts as we begin our Bicentennial .<speech_sep>President , Secretary General , your Excellencies In 1946 , President Harry Truman welcomed representatives of 55 nations to the first General Assembly of the United Nations . Since then , every American President has had the great honor of addressing this Assembly . Today , with pleasure and humility , I take my turn in welcoming you , the distinguished representatives of 138 nations . When I took office , I told the American people that my remarks would be just a little straight talk among friends . Straight talk is what I propose here today in the first of my addresses to the representatives of the world . Next week , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will present in specifics the overall principles which I will outline in my remarks today . It should be emphatically understood that the Secretary of State has my full support and the unquestioned backing of the American people . As a party leader in the Congress of the United States , as Vice President , and now as President of the United States of America , I have had the closest working relationship with Secretary of State Kissinger . I have supported and will continue to endorse his many efforts as Secretary of State and in our National Security Council system to build a world of peace . Since the United Nations was rounded , the world has experienced conflicts and threats to peace , but we have avoided the greatest danger another world war . Today , we have the opportunity to make the remainder of this century an era of peace and cooperation and economic well being . The harsh hostilities which once held great powers in their rigid grasp have now begun to moderate . Many of the crises which dominated past General Assemblies are fortunately behind us . And technological progress holds out the hope that one day all men can achieve a decent life . Nations too often have had no choice but to be either hammer or anvil , to strike or to be struck . Now we have a new opportunity to forge , in concert with others , a framework of international cooperation . That is the course the United States has chosen for itself . On behalf of the American people , I renew these basic pledges to you today We are committed to a pursuit of a more peaceful , stable , and cooperative world . While we are determined never to be bested in a test of strength , we will devote our strength to what is best . And in the nuclear era , there is no rational alternative to accords of mutual restraint between the United States and the Soviet Union , two nations which have the power to destroy mankind . We will bolster our partnerships with traditional friends in Europe , Asia , and Latin America to meet new challenges in a rapidly changing world . The maintenance of such relationships underpins rather than undercuts the search for peace . We will seek out , we will expand our relations with old adversaries . For example , our new rapport with the People s Republic of China best serves the purposes of each nation and the interests of the entire world . We will strive to heal old wounds , reopened in recent conflicts in Cyprus , the Middle East , and in Indochina . Peace cannot be imposed from without , but we will do whatever is within our capacity to help achieve it . We rededicate ourselves to the search for justice , equality , and freedom . Recent developments in Africa signal the welcome end of colonialism . Behavior appropriate to an era of dependence must give way to the new responsibilities of an era of interdependence . No single nation , no single group of nations , no single organization can meet all of the challenges before the community of nations . We must act in concert . Progress toward a better world must come through cooperative efforts across the whole range of bilateral and multilateral relations . America s revolutionary birth and centuries of experience in adjusting democratic government to changing conditions have made Americans practical as well as idealistic . As idealists , we are proud of our role in the founding of the United Nations and in supporting its many accomplishments . As practical people , we are sometimes impatient at what we see as shortcomings . In my 25 years as a Member of the Congress of the United States , I learned two basic , practical lessons First , men of differing political persuasions can find common ground for cooperation . We need not agree on all issues in order to agree on most . Differences of principle , of purpose , of perspective , will not disappear . But neither will our mutual problems disappear unless we are determined to find mutually helpful solutions . Second , a majority must take into account the proper interest of a minority if the decisions of the majority are to be accepted . We who believe in and live by majority rule must always be alert to the danger of the tyranny of the majority . Majority rule thrives on the habits of accommodation , moderation , and consideration of the interests of others . A very stark reality has tempered America s actions for decades and must now temper the actions of all nations . Prevention of full scale warfare in the nuclear age has become everybody s responsibility . Today s regional conflict must not become tomorrow s world disaster . We must assure by every means at our disposal that local crises are quickly contained and resolved . The challenge before the United States is very clear . This organization can place the weight of the world community on the side of world peace . And this organization can provide impartial forces to maintain the peace . And at this point I wish to pay tribute on behalf of the American people to the 37 members of the United Nations peacekeeping forces who have given their lives in the Middle East and in Cyprus in the past 10 months , and I convey our deepest sympathies to their loved ones . Let the quality of our response measure up to the magnitude of the challenge that we face . I pledge to you that America will continue to be constructive , innovative , and responsive to the work of this great body . The nations in this hall are united by a deep concern for peace . We are united as well by our desire to ensure a better life for all people . Today , the economy of the world is under unprecedented stress . We need new approaches to international cooperation to respond effectively to the problems that we face . Developing and developed countries , market and nonmarket countries we are all a part of one interdependent economic system . The food and oil crises demonstrate the extent of our interdependence . Many developing nations need the food surplus of a few developed nations . And many industrialized nations need the oil production of a few developing nations . Energy is required to produce food and food to produce energy and both to provide a decent life for everyone . The problems of food and energy can be resolved on the basis of cooperation , or can , I should say , made unmanageable on the basis of confrontation . Runaway inflation , propelled by food and oil price increases , is an early warning signal to all of us . Let us not delude ourselves . Failure to cooperate on oil and food and inflation could spell disaster for every nation represented in this room . The United Nations must not and need not allow this to occur . A global strategy for food and energy is urgently required . The United States believes four principles should guide a global approach First , all nations must substantially increase production . Just to maintain the present standards of living the world must almost double its output of food and energy to match the expected increase in the world s population by the end of this century . To meet aspirations for a better life , production will have to expand at a significantly faster rate than population growth . Second , all nations must seek to achieve a level of prices which not only provides an incentive to producers but which consumers can afford . It should now be clear that the developed nations are not the only countries which demand and receive an adequate return for their goods . But it should also be clear that by confronting consumers with production restrictions , artificial pricing , and the prospect of ultimate bankruptcy , producers will eventually become the victims of their own actions . Third , all nations must avoid the abuse of man s fundamental needs for the sake of narrow national or bloc advantage . The attempt by any nation to use one commodity for political purposes will inevitably tempt other countries to use their commodities for their own purposes . Fourth , the nations of the world must assure that the poorest among us are not overwhelmed by rising prices of the imports necessary for their survival . The traditional aid donors and the increasingly wealthy oil producers must join in this effort . The United States recognizes the special responsibility we bear as the world s largest producer of food . That is why Secretary of State Kissinger proposed from this very podium last year a world food conference to define a global food policy . And that is one reason why we have removed domestic restrictions on food productions in the United States . It has not been our policy to use food as a political weapon , despite the oil embargo and recent oil prices and production decisions . It would be tempting for the United States beset by inflation and soaring energy prices to turn a deaf ear to external appeals for food assistance , or to respond with internal appeals for export controls . But however difficult our own economic situation , we recognize that the plight of others is worse . Americans have always responded to human emergencies in the past , and we respond again here today . In response to Secretary General Waldheim s appeal and to help meet the long term challenge in food , I reiterate To help developing nations realize their aspirations to grow more of their own food , the United States will substantially increase its assistance to agricultural production programs in other countries . Next , to ensure that the survival of millions of our fellow men does not depend upon the vagaries of weather , the United States is prepared to join in a worldwide effort to negotiate , establish , and maintain an international system of food reserves . This system will work best if each nation is made responsible for managing the reserves that it will have available . Finally , to make certain that the more immediate needs for food are met this year , the United States will not only maintain the amount it spends for food shipments to nations in need but it will increase this amount this year . Thus , the United States is striving to help define and help contribute to a cooperative global policy to meet man s immediate and long term need for food . We will set forth our comprehensive proposals at the World Food Conference in November . Now is the time for oil producers to define their conception of a global policy on energy to meet the growing need and to do this without imposing unacceptable burdens on the international monetary and trade system . A world of economic confrontation cannot be a world of political cooperation . If we fail to satisfy man s fundamental needs for energy and food , we face a threat not just to our aspirations for a better life for all our peoples but to our hopes for a more stable and a more peaceful world . By working together to overcome our common problems , mankind can turn from fear towards hope . From the time of the founding of the United Nations , America volunteered to help nations in need , frequently as the main benefactor . We were able to do it . We were glad to do it . But as new economic forces alter and reshape today s complex world , no nation can be expected to feed all the world s hungry peoples . Fortunately , however , many nations are increasingly able to help . And I call on them to join with us as truly united nations in the struggle to produce , to provide more food at lower prices for the hungry and , in general , a better life for the needy of this world . America will continue to do more than its share . But there are realistic limits to our capacities . There is no limit , however , to our determination to act in concert with other nations to fulfill the vision of the United Nations Charter , to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , and to promote social progress and better standards , better standards of life in a larger freedom . Thank you very , very much .<speech_sep>
