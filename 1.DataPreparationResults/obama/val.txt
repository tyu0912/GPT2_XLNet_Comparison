Thank you . Well , I am excited , too . Of the many responsibilities granted to a President by our Constitution , few are more serious or more consequential than selecting a Supreme Court justice . The members of our highest court are granted life tenure , often serving long after the Presidents who appointed them . And they are charged with the vital task of applying principles put to paper more than 20 centuries ago to some of the most difficult questions of our time . So I do not take this decision lightly . I have made it only after deep reflection and careful deliberation . While there are many qualities that I admire in judges across the spectrum of judicial philosophy , and that I seek in my own nominee , there are few that stand out that I just want to mention . First and foremost is a rigorous intellect a mastery of the law , an ability to hone in on the key issues and provide clear answers to complex legal questions . Second is a recognition of the limits of the judicial role , an understanding that a judge s job is to interpret , not make , law to approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda , but rather a commitment to impartial justice a respect for precedent and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand . These two qualities are essential , I believe , for anyone who would sit on our nation s highest court . And yet , these qualities alone are insufficient . We need something more . For as Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said , The life of the law has not been logic it has been experience . Experience being tested by obstacles and barriers , by hardship and misfortune experience insisting , persisting , and ultimately overcoming those barriers . It is experience that can give a person a common touch and a sense of compassion an understanding of how the world works and how ordinary people live . And that is why it is a necessary ingredient in the kind of justice we need on the Supreme Court . The process of reviewing and selecting a successor to Justice Souter has been rigorous and comprehensive , not least because of the standard that Justice Souter himself has set with his formidable intellect and fair mindedness and decency . I have sought the advice of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle , including every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee . My team has reached out to constitutional scholars , advocacy organizations , and bar associations representing an array of interests and opinions . And I want to thank members of my staff and administration who have worked so hard and given so much of their time as part of this effort . After completing this exhaustive process , I have decided to nominate an inspiring woman who I believe will make a great justice Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the great state of New York . Over a distinguished career that spans three decades , Judge Sotomayor has worked at almost every level of our judicial system , providing her with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a Supreme Court justice . It is a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the District Court by a Republican President , George Bush , and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat , Bill Clinton . Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench , and more varied experience on the bench , than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed . Judge Sotomayor is a distinguished graduate of two of America s leading universities . She is been a big city prosecutor and a corporate litigator . She spent six years as a trial judge on the District Court , and would replace Justice Souter as the only justice with experience as a trial judge , a perspective that would enrich the judgments of the Court . For the past 11 years she has been a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of New York , one of the most demanding circuits in the country . There she has handed down decisions on a range of constitutional and legal questions that are notable for their careful reasoning , earning the respect of colleagues on the bench , the admiration of many lawyers who argue cases in her court , and the adoration of her clerks who look to her as a mentor . During her tenure on the District Court , she presided over roughly 450 cases . One case in particular involved a matter of enormous concern to many Americans , including me the baseball strike of 1994 1995 . In a decision that reportedly took her just 15 minutes to announce , a swiftness much appreciated by baseball fans everywhere she issued an injunction that helped end the strike . Some say that Judge Sotomayor saved baseball . Judge Sotomayor came to the District Court from a law firm where she was a partner focused on complex commercial litigation , gaining insight into the workings of a global economy . Before that she was a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA s office , serving under the legendary Robert Morgenthau , an early mentor of Sonia s who still sings her praises today . There , Sonia learned what crime can do to a family and a community , and what it takes to fight it . It is a career that has given her not only a sweeping overview of the American judicial system , but a practical understanding of how the law works in the everyday lives of the American people . But as impressive and meaningful as Judge Sotomayor s sterling credentials in the law is her own extraordinary journey . Born in the South Bronx , she was raised in a housing project not far from Yankee Stadium , making her a lifelong Yankee s fan . I hope this will not disqualify her in the eyes of the New Englanders in the Senate . Sonia s parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during the second world war , her mother as part of the Women s Army Corps . And , in fact , her mother is here today and I had like us all to acknowledge Sonia s mom . Sonia s mom has been a little choked up . But she , Sonia s mother , began a family tradition of giving back to this country . Sonia s father was a factory worker with a 3rd grade education who did not speak English . But like Sonia s mother , he had a willingness to work hard , a strong sense of family , and a belief in the American Dream . When Sonia was nine , her father passed away . And her mother worked six days a week as a nurse to provide for Sonia and her brother who is also here today , is a doctor and a terrific success in his own right . But Sonia s mom bought the only set of encyclopedias in the neighborhood , sent her children to a Catholic school called Cardinal Spellman out of the belief that with a good education here in America all things are possible . With the support of family , friends , and teachers , Sonia earned scholarships to Princeton , where she graduated at the top of her class , and Yale Law School , where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal , stepping onto the path that led her here today . Along the way she is faced down barriers , overcome the odds , lived out the American Dream that brought her parents here so long ago . And even as she has accomplished so much in her life , she has never forgotten where she began , never lost touch with the community that supported her . What Sonia will bring to the Court , then , is not only the knowledge and experience acquired over a course of a brilliant legal career , but the wisdom accumulated from an inspiring life s journey . It is my understanding that Judge Sotomayor s interest in the law was sparked as a young girl by reading the Nancy Drew series and that when she was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of eight , she was informed that people with diabetes cannot grow up to be police officers or private investigators like Nancy Drew . And that is when she was told she had have to scale back her dreams . Well , Sonia , what you have shown in your life is that it does not matter where you come from , what you look like , or what challenges life throws your way no dream is beyond reach in the United States of America . And when Sonia Sotomayor ascends those marble steps to assume her seat on the highest court of the land , America will have taken another important step towards realizing the ideal that is etched above its entrance Equal justice under the law . I hope the Senate acts in a bipartisan fashion , as it has in confirming Judge Sotomayor twice before , and as swiftly as possible so that she can take her seat on the Court in September and participate in deliberations as the Court chooses which cases it will hear this coming year . And with that , I had like all of you to give a warm greeting as I invite Judge Sotomayor to say a few words .Thank you so much . Good afternoon . I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions . For over a thousand years , Al Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning , and for over a century , Cairo University has been a source of Egypt s advancement . And together , you represent the harmony between tradition and progress . I am grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt . And I am also proud to carry with me the good will of the American people and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country As salaamu alaykum . We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world , tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate . The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation , but also conflict and religious wars . More recently , tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims and a cold war in which Muslim majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations . Moreover , the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam . Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small , but potent minority of Muslims . The attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries , but also to human rights . All this has bred more fear and more mistrust . So long as our relationship is defined by our differences , we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace , those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity . And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end . I have come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world , one based on mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition . Instead , they overlap and share common principles , principles of justice and progress , tolerance and the dignity of all human beings . I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight . I know there is been a lot of publicity about this speech , but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust . Nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point . But I am convinced that in order to move forward , we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors . There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other , to learn from each other , to respect one another , and to seek common ground . As the Holy Koran tells us Be conscious of God and speak always the truth . That is what I will try to do today , to speak the truth as best I can , humbled by the task before us and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart . Now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience . I am a Christian , but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims . As a boy , I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk . As a young man , I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith . As a student of history , I also know civilization s debt to Islam . It was Islam , at places like Al Azhar , that carried the light of learning through so many centuries , paving the way for Europe s renaissance and enlightenment . It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra , our magnetic compass and tools of navigation , our mastery of pens and printing , our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed . Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires , timeless poetry and cherished music , elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation . And throughout history , Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality . I also know that Islam has always been a part of America s story . The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco . In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796 , our second President , John Adams , wrote The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion , or tranquillity of Muslims . And since our founding , American Muslims have enriched the United States . They have fought in our wars they have served in our government they have stood for civil rights they have started businesses they have taught at our universities they have excelled in our sports arenas they have won Nobel Prizes , built our tallest building , and lit the Olympic Torch . And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress , he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers , Thomas Jefferson , kept in his personal library . So , I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed . That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is , not what it is not . And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear . But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America . Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype , America is not the crude stereotype of a self interested empire . The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known . We were born out of revolution against an empire . We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal , and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words , within our borders and around the world . We are shaped by every culture , drawn from every end of the Earth , and dedicated to a simple concept E pluribus unum Out of many , one . Now , much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President . But my personal story is not so unique . The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America , but its promise exists for all who come to our shores , and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today , who , by the way , enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the American average . Moreover , freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one s religion . That is why there is a mosque in every State in our Union and over 1 , 200 mosques within our borders . That is why the United States Government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab and to punish those who would deny it . So let there be no doubt , Islam is a part of America . And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race , religion , or station in life , all of us share common aspirations to live in peace and security , to get an education and to work with dignity , to love our families , our communities , and our God . These things we share . This is the hope of all humanity . Of course , recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task . Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people . These needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all . For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country , prosperity is hurt everywhere . When a new flu infects one human being , all are at risk . When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon , the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations . When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains , people are endangered across an ocean . When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered , that is a stain on our collective conscience . That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century . That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings . And this is a difficult responsibility to embrace , for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes and , yes , religions subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests . Yet in this new age , such attitudes are self defeating . Given our interdependence , any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail . So whatever we think of the past , we must not be prisoners to it . Our problems must be dealt with through partnership our progress must be shared . Now , that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension . Indeed , it suggests the opposite . We must face these tensions squarely . And so in that spirit , let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together . The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms . In Ankara , I made clear that America is not , and never will be , at war with Islam . We will , however , relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security , because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject the killing of innocent men , women , and children . And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people . The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America s goals and our need to work together . Over 7 years ago , the United States pursued Al Qaida and the Taliban with broad international support . We did not go by choice we went because of necessity . I am aware that there is still some who would question or even justify the events of 9 11 . But let us be clear Al Qaida killed nearly 3 , 000 people on that day . The victims were innocent men , women , and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody . And yet , Al Qaida chose to ruthlessly murder these people , claimed credit for the attack , and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale . They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach . These are not opinions to be debated these are facts to be dealt with . Make no mistake , we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan . We see no we seek no military bases there . It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women . It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict . We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home , if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can . But that is not yet the case . And that is why we are partnering with a coalition of 46 countries . And despite the costs involved , America s commitment will not weaken . Indeed , none of us should tolerate these extremists . They have killed in many countries . They have killed people of different faiths , but more than any other , they have killed Muslims . Their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings , the progress of nations , and with Islam . The Holy Koran teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as it is as if he has killed all mankind . And the Holy Koran also says , whoever saves a person , it is as if he has saved all mankind . The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few . Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism , it is an important part of promoting peace . Now , we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan . That is why we plan to invest 1 . 5 billion each year over the next 5 years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals , roads and businesses , and hundreds of millions to help those who have been displaced . That is why we are providing more than 2 . 8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on . Let me also address the issue of Iraq . Unlike Afghanistan , Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world . Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein , I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible . Indeed , we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson , who said I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power , the greater it will be . Today , America has a dual responsibility to help Iraq forge a better future and to leave Iraq to Iraqis . And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases and no claim on their territory or resources . Iraq s sovereignty is its own . And that is why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August . That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq s democratically elected Government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012 . We will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy , but we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner , and never as a patron . And finally , just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists , we must never alter or forget our principles . Nine eleven was an enormous trauma to our country . The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable , but in some cases , it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals . We are taking concrete actions to change course . I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States , and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year . So America will defend itself , respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law , and we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities , which are also threatened . The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities , the sooner we will all be safer . The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis , Palestinians , and the Arab world . America s strong bonds with Israel are well known . This bond is unbreakable . It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied . Around the world , the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries , and anti Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust . Tomorrow I will visit Buchenwald , which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved , tortured , shot , and gassed to death by the Third Reich . Six million Jews were killed , more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today . Denying that fact is baseless , it is ignorant , and it is hateful . Threatening Israel with destruction or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve . On the other hand , it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people , Muslims and Christians , have suffered in pursuit of a homeland . For more than 60 years , they have endured the pain of dislocation . Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank , Gaza , and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead . They endure the daily humiliations , large and small , that come with occupation . So let there be no doubt , the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable , and America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity , opportunity , and a state of their own . For decades then , there has been a stalemate two peoples with legitimate aspirations , each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive . It is easy to point fingers , for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel s founding and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders , as well as beyond . But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other , then we will be blind to the truth . The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states , where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security . That is in Israel s interest , Palestine s interest , America s interest , and the world s interest . And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires . The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear . For peace to come , it is time for them , and all of us , to live up to our responsibilities . Palestinians must abandon violence . Resistance through violence and killing is wrong , and it does not succeed . For centuries , black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation . But it was not violence that won full and equal rights . It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America s founding . This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia , from Eastern Europe to Indonesia . It is a story with a simple truth Violence is a dead end . It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children or to blow up old women on a bus . That is not how moral authority is claimed that is how it is surrendered . Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build . The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern with institutions that serve the needs of its people . Hamas does have support among some Palestinians , but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities . To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations , to unify the Palestinian people , Hamas must put an end to violence , recognize past agreements , recognize Israel s right to exist . At the same time , Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel s right to exist cannot be denied , neither can Palestine s . The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements . This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace . It is time for these settlements to stop . And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society . Just as it devastates Palestinian families , the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel s security , neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank . Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace , and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress . And finally , the Arab States must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning , but not the end of their responsibilities . The Arab Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems . Instead , it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state , to recognize Israel s legitimacy , and to choose progress over a self defeating focus on the past . America will align our policies with those who pursue peace , and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs . We cannot impose peace . But privately , many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away . Likewise , many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state . It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true . Too many tears have been shed . Too much blood has been shed . All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear , when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be , when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra , when Moses , Jesus , and Muhammed , peace be upon them , joined in prayer . The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons . This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran . For many years , Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country , and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us . In the middle of the cold war , the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian Government . Since the Islamic Revolution , Iran has played a role in acts of hostage taking and violence against troops and civilians . This history is well known . Rather than remain trapped in the past , I have made it clear to Iran s leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward . The question now is not what Iran is against , but rather what future it wants to build . I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust , but we will proceed with courage , rectitude , and resolve . There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries , and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect . But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons , we have reached a decisive point . This is not simply about America s interests . It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path . I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not . No single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons . And that is why I strongly reaffirmed America s commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons . And any nation , including Iran , should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power , if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty . That commitment is at the core of the treaty , and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it . And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal . The fourth issue that I will address is democracy . I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years , and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq . So let me be clear No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other . That does not lessen my commitment , however , to governments that reflect the will of the people . Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way , grounded in the traditions of its own people . America does not presume to know what is best for everyone , just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election . But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed , confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice , government that is transparent and does not steal from the people , the freedom to live as you choose . These are not just American ideas , they are human rights . And that is why we will support them everywhere . Now , there is no straight line to realize this promise , but this much is clear Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable , successful , and secure . Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . America respects the right of all peaceful and law abiding voices to be heard around the world , even if we disagree with them . And we will welcome all elected , peaceful governments , provided they govern with respect for all their people . This last point is important , because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they are out of power . Once in power , they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others . So no matter where it takes hold , government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power . You must maintain your power through consent , not coercion you must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party . Without these ingredients , elections alone do not make true democracy . Audience member . We love you The President . Thank you . The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom . Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance . We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition . I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia , where devout Christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country . That is the spirit we need today . People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul . This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive , but it is being challenged in many different ways . Among some Muslims , there is a disturbing tendency to measure one s own faith by the rejection of somebody else s faith . The richness of religious diversity must be upheld , whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt . And if we are being honest , fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well , as the divisions between Sunni and Shi a have led to tragic violence , particularly in Iraq . Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together . We must always examine the ways in which we protect it . For instance , in the United States , rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation . That is why I am committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat . Likewise , it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit , for instance , by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear . We cannot disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism . In fact , faith should bring us together . And that is why we are forging service projects in America to bring together Christians , Muslims , and Jews . That is why we welcome efforts like Saudi Arabian King Abdallah s interfaith dialog and Turkey s leadership in the Alliance of Civilizations . Around the world , we can turn dialog into interfaith service , so bridges between peoples lead to action , whether it is combating malaria in Africa or providing relief after a natural disaster . The sixth issue that I want to address is women s rights . I know I know , and you can tell from this audience , that there is a healthy debate about this issue . I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal , but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality . And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to be prosperous . Now , let me be clear Issues of women s equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam . In Turkey , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Indonesia , we have seen Muslim majority countries elect a woman to lead . Meanwhile , the struggle for women s equality continues in many aspects of American life and in countries around the world . I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons . Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity , men and women , to reach their full potential . I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal , and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles . But it should be their choice . And that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim majority country to support expanded literacy for girls and to help young women pursue employment through microfinancing that helps people live their dreams . Finally , I want to discuss economic development and opportunity . I know that for many , the face of globalization is contradictory . The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information , but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home . Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities , but also huge disruptions and change in communities . In all nations , including America , this change can bring fear . Fear that because of modernity , we lose control over our economic choices , our politics , and , most importantly , our identities , those things we most cherish about our communities , our families , our traditions , and our faith . But I also know that human progress cannot be denied . There need not be contradictions between development and tradition . Countries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures . The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai . In ancient times and in our times , Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education . And this is important , because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground , nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work . Many Gulf States have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil , and some are beginning to focus it on broader development . But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century , and in too many Muslim communities there remains underinvestment in these areas . I am emphasizing such investment within my own country . And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world , we now seek a broader engagement . On education , we will expand exchange programs and increase scholarships like the one that brought my father to America . At the same time , we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities . And we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America , invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world , and create a new online network so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo . On economic development , we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim majority countries . And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders , foundations , and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world . On science and technology , we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim majority countries and to help transfer ideas to mark to the marketplace so they can create more jobs . We will open centers of scientific excellence in Africa , the Middle East , and Southeast Asia and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy , create green jobs , digitize records , clean water , grow new crops . Today I am announcing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio . And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health . All these things must be done in partnership . Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments , community organizations , religious leaders , and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life . And the issues that I have described will not be easy to address , but we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek , a world where extremists no longer threaten our people and American troops have come home , a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes , a world where governments serve their citizens and the rights of all God s children are respected . Those are mutual interests . That is the world we seek , but we can only achieve it together . I know there are many , Muslim and non Muslim , who question whether we can forge this new beginning . Some are eager to stoke the flames of division and to stand in the way of progress . Some suggest that it is not worth the effort , that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash . Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur . There is so much fear , so much mistrust that has built up over the years . But if we choose to be bound by the past , we will never move forward . And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country You , more than anyone , have the ability to reimagine the world , to remake this world . All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time . The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart , or whether we commit ourselves to an effort , a sustained effort to find common ground , to focus on the future we seek for our children , and to respect the dignity of all human beings . It is easier to start wars than to end them . It is easier to blame others than to look inward . It is easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share . But we should choose the right path , not just the easy path . There is one rule that lies at the heart of every religion , that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us . This truth transcends nations and peoples , a belief that is not new , that is not black or white or brown , that is not Christian or Muslim or Jew . It is a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world . It is a faith in other people , and it is what brought me here today . We have the power to make the world we seek , but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning , keeping in mind what has been written . The Holy Koran tells us O mankind We have created you male and a female , and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another . The Talmud tells us The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace . The Holy Bible tells us Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God . The people of the world can live together in peace . We know that is God s vision , now that must be our work here on Earth . Thank you , and may God s peace be upon you . Thank you very much . Thank you .Madam Speaker , Vice President Biden , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Our Constitution declares that from time to time , the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our Union . For 220 years , our leaders have fulfilled this duty . They have done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility , and they have done so in the midst of war and depression , at moments of great strife and great struggle . It is tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable , that America was always destined to succeed . But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach , victory was very much in doubt . When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday , the future was anything but certain . These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our Union . And despite all our divisions and disagreements , our hesitations and our fears , America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation , as one people . Again , we are tested . And again , we must answer history s call . One year ago , I took office amid two wars , an economy rocked by a severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a Government deeply in debt . Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act , we might face a second depression . So we acted , immediately and aggressively . And 1 year later , the worst of the storm has passed . But the devastation remains . One in 10 Americans still cannot find work . Many businesses have shuttered . Home values have declined . Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard . And for those who d already known poverty , life s become that much harder . This recession has also compounded the burdens that America s families have been dealing with for decades the burden of working harder and longer for less , of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college . So I know the anxieties that are out there right now . They are not new . These struggles are the reason I ran for President . These struggles are what I have witnessed for years , in places like Elkhart , Indiana Galesburg , Illinois . I hear about them in the letters that I read each night . The toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home , asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work . For these Americans and so many others , change has not come fast enough . Some are frustrated , some are angry . They do not understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded , but hard work on Main Street is not , or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems . They are tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness . They know we cannot afford it . Not now . So we face big and difficult challenges . And what the American people hope , what they deserve , is for all of us , Democrats and Republicans , to work through our differences , to overcome the numbing weight of our politics . For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds , different stories , different beliefs , the anxieties they face are the same . The aspirations they hold are shared a job that pays the bills a chance to get ahead most of all , the ability to give their children a better life . And you know what else they share They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity . After one of the most difficult years in our history , they remain busy building cars and teaching kids , starting businesses and going back to school . They are coaching Little League and helping their neighbors . One woman wrote to me and said , We are strained but hopeful , struggling but encouraged . It is because of this spirit , this great decency and great strength , that I have never been more hopeful about America s future than I am tonight . Despite our hardships , our Union is strong . We do not give up . We do not quit . We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit . In this new decade , it is time the American people get a Government that matches their decency , that embodies their strength . And tonight I had like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise . It begins with our economy . Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis . It was not easy to do . And if there is one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between , it is that we all hated the bank bailout . I hated it . I hated it you hated it . It was about as popular as a root canal . But when I ran for President , I promised I would not just do what was popular I would do what was necessary . And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system , unemployment might be double what it is today . More businesses would certainly have closed . More homes would have surely been lost . So I supported the last administration s efforts to create the financial rescue program . And when we took that program over , we made it more transparent and more accountable . And as a result , the markets are now stabilized , and we have recovered most of the money we spent on the banks most but not all . To recover the rest , I have proposed a fee on the biggest banks . Now , I know Wall Street is not keen on this idea . But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again , they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need . Now , as we stabilized the financial system , we also took steps to get our economy growing again , save as many jobs as possible , and help Americans who had become unemployed . That is why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans , made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRand passed 25 different tax cuts . Now , let me repeat We cut taxes . We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families . We cut taxes for small businesses . We cut taxes for first time home buyers . We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children . We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college . I thought I had get some applause on that one . As a result , millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities , all of which helped businesses keep more workers . And we have not raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person not a single dime . Now , because of the steps we took , there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed . Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy . Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers . Tens of thousands are cops , firefighters , correctional officers , first responders . And we are on track to add another 1 frac12 million jobs to this total by the end of the year . The plan that has made all of this possible , from the tax cuts to the jobs , is the Recovery Act . That is right , the Recovery Act , also known as the stimulus bill . Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster . But you do not have to take their word for it . Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act . Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act , until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created . Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act , she would not be laid off after all . There are stories like this all across America . And after 2 years of recession , the economy is growing again . Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value . Businesses are beginning to invest again , and slowly some are starting to hire again . But I realize that for every success story , there are other stories , of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from , who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response . That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010 , and that is why I am calling for a new jobs bill tonight . Now , the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America s businesses . I agree , absolutely . But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers . We should start where most new jobs do , in small businesses , companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it is time she became her own boss . Through sheer grit and determination , these companies have weathered the recession , and they are ready to grow . But when you talk to small business owners in places like Allentown , Pennsylvania , or Elyria , Ohio , you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again , they are mostly lending to bigger companies . Financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country , even those that are making a profit . So tonight I am proposing that we take 30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat . I am also proposing a new small business tax credit , one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages . While we are at it , let us also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment . Next , we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow . From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System , our Nation has always been built to compete . There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products . Tomorrow I will visit Tampa , Florida , where workers will soon break ground on a new high speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act . There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation s goods , services , and information . We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient , which supports clean energy jobs . And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders , it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America . Now , the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps . As the first order of business this year , I urge the Senate to do the same , and I know they will . They will . People are out of work . They are hurting . They need our help . And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay . But the truth is , these steps will not make up for the 7 million jobs that we have lost over the last 2 years . The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problems that America s families have confronted for years . We cannot afford another so called economic expansion like the one from the last decade , what some call the lost decade , where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion , where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs , where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation . From the day I took office , I have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious . I have been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while . For those who make these claims , I have one simple question How long should we wait How long should America put its future on hold You see , Washington has been telling us to wait for decades , even as the problems have grown worse . Meanwhile , China s not waiting to revamp its economy . Germany s not waiting . India s not waiting . These nations are they are not standing still . These nations are not playing for second place . They are putting more emphasis on math and science . They are rebuilding their infrastructure . They are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs . Well , I do not accept second place for the United States of America . As hard as it may be , as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become , it is time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth . Now , one place to start is serious financial reform . Look , I am not interested in punishing banks . I am interested in protecting our economy . A strong , healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs . It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes . But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy . We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions . We cannot allow financial institutions , including those that take your deposits , to take risks that threaten the whole economy . Now , the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes , and the lobbyists are trying to kill it . But we cannot let them win this fight . And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform , I will send it back until we get it right . We have got to get it right . Next , we need to encourage American innovation . Last year , we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history , an investment that could lead to the world s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched . And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy . You can see the results of last year s investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1 , 200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels . But to create more of these clean energy jobs , we need more production , more efficiency , more incentives . And that means building a new generation of safe , clean nuclear powerplants in this country . It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development . It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies . And , yes , it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America . Now , I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year . And this year , I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate . I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy . I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change . But here s the thing Even if you doubt the evidence , providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future , because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy . And America must be that nation . Third , we need to export more of our goods , because the more products we make and sell to other countries , the more jobs we support right here in America . So tonight we set a new goal We will double our exports over the next 5 years , an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America . To help meet this goal , we are launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security . We have to seek new markets aggressively , just as our competitors are . If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals , we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores . But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules . And that is why we will continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia . Fourth , we need to invest in the skills and education of our people . Now , this year , we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools . And the idea here is simple Instead of rewarding failure , we only reward success . Instead of funding the status quo , we only invest in reform , reform that raises student achievement , inspires students to excel in math and science , and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans , from rural communities to the inner city . In the 21st century , the best antipoverty program around is a world class education . And in this country , the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential . When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States . Still , in this economy , a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job . That is why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges , which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families . To make college more affordable , this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans . Instead , let us take that money and give families a 10 , 000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants . And let us tell another 1 million students that when they graduate , they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they chose to go to college . And by the way , it is time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs , because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem . Now , the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class . That is why last year , I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families . That is why we are nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg . That is why we are working to lift the value of a family s single largest investment , their home . The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of 1 , 500 on mortgage payments . This year , we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages . And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform . Yes , we do . Now , let us clear a few things up . I did not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt . And by now it should be fairly obvious that I did not take on health care because it was good politics . I took on health care because of the stories I have heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage , patients who have been denied coverage , families , even those with insurance , who are just one illness away from financial ruin . After nearly a century of trying Democratic administrations , Republican administrations we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans . The approach we have taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry . It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market . It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care . And by the way , I want to acknowledge our First Lady , Michelle Obama , who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier . Thank you , honey . She gets embarrassed . Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan . It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses . And according to the Congressional Budget Office , the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress , our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as 1 trillion over the next two decades . Still , this is a complex issue , and the longer it was debated , the more skeptical people became . I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people . And I know that with all the lobbying and horse trading , the process left most Americans wondering , What is in it for me But I also know this problem is not going away . By the time I am finished speaking tonight , more Americans will have lost their health insurance . Millions will lose it this year . Our deficit will grow . Premiums will go up . Patients will be denied the care they need . Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether . I will not walk away from these Americans , and neither should the people in this Chamber . So , as temperatures cool , I want everyone to take another look at the plan we have proposed . There is a reason why many doctors , nurses , and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo . But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums , bring down the deficit , cover the uninsured , strengthen Medicare for seniors , and stop insurance company abuses , let me know . Let me know . Let me know . I am eager to see it . Here s what I ask Congress , though Do not walk away from reform . Not now . Not when we are so close . Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . Now , even as health care reform would reduce our deficit , it is not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves . It is a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that is been subject to a lot of political posturing . So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight . At the beginning of the last decade , the year 2000 , America had a budget surplus of over 200 billion . By the time I took office , we had a 1 year deficit of over 1 trillion and projected deficits of 8 trillion over the next decade . Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars , two tax cuts , and an expensive prescription drug program . On top of that , the effects of the recession put a 3 trillion hole in our budget . All this was before I walked in the door . Now just stating the facts . Now , if we had taken office in ordinary times , I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit . But we took office amid a crisis . And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another 1 trillion to our national debt . That too is a fact . I am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do . But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions . The Federal Government should do the same . So tonight I am proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year . Starting in 2011 , we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years . Spending related to our national security , Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security will not be affected . But all other discretionary Government programs will . Like any cash strapped family , we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we do not . And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto , I will . We will continue to go through the budget , line by line , page by page , to eliminate programs that we cannot afford and do not work . We have already identified 20 billion in savings for next year . To help working families , we will extend our middle class tax cuts . But at a time of record deficits , we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies , for investment fund managers , and for those making over 250 , 000 a year . We just cannot afford it . Now , even after paying for what we spent on my watch , we will still face the massive deficit we had when I took office . More importantly , the cost of Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security will continue to skyrocket . That is why I have called for a bipartisan fiscal commission , modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad . This cannot be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem . The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline . Now , yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission , so I will issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward , because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans . And when the vote comes tomorrow , the Senate should restore the pay as you go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s . Now , I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting . And I agree , which is why this freeze will not take effect until next year , when the economy is stronger . That is how budgeting works . But understand , if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our debt , it could damage our markets , increase the cost of borrowing , and jeopardize our recovery , all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes . From some on the right , I expect we will hear a different argument , that if we just make fewer investments in our people , extend tax cuts , including those for the wealthier Americans , eliminate more regulations , maintain the status quo on health care , our deficits will go away . The problem is , that is what we did for 8 years . That is what helped us into this crisis . It is what helped lead to these deficits . We cannot do it again . Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades , it is time to try something new . Let us invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt . Let us meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here . Let us try common sense a novel concept . Now , to do that , we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now . We face a deficit of trust , deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years . To close that credibility gap , we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists , to do our work openly , to give our people the Government they deserve . Now , that is what I came to Washington to do . That is why , for the first time in history , my administration posts on our White House visitors online . That is why we have excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions . But we cannot stop there . It is time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client , with my administration or with Congress . It is time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office . With all due deference to separation of powers , last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations , to spend without limit in our elections . I do not think American elections should be bankrolled by America s most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities . They should be decided by the American people . And I had urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems . I am also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform , Democrats and Republicans Democrats and Republicans . Look , you have trimmed some of this spending , you have embraced some meaningful change , but restoring the public trust demands more . For example , some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online . Tonight I am calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there is a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent . Of course , none of these reforms will even happen if we do not also reform how we work with one another . Now , I am not naive . I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some postpartisan era . I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched . And on some issues , there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways . These disagreements , about the role of government in our lives , about our national priorities and our national security , they have been taking place for over 200 years . They are the very essence of our democracy . But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day . We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side , a belief that if you lose , I win . Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can . The confirmation of I am speaking to both parties now . The confirmation of well qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators . Washington may think that saying anything about the other side , no matter how false , no matter how malicious , is just part of the game . But it is precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people . Worse yet , it is sowing further division among our citizens , further distrust in our Government . So , no , I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics . I know it is an election year . And after last week , it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual . But we still need to govern . To Democrats , I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems , not run for the hills . And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town a supermajority then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well . Just saying no to everything may be good short term politics , but it is not leadership . We were sent here to serve our citizens , not our ambitions . So let us show the American people that we can do it together . This week , I will be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans . I had like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership . I know you cannot wait . Now , throughout our history , no issue has united this country more than our security . Sadly , some of the unity we felt after 9 11 has dissipated . And we can argue all we want about who is to blame for this , but I am not interested in relitigating the past . I know that all of us love this country . All of us are committed to its defense . So let us put aside the schoolyard taunts about who is tough . Let us reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values . Let us leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our Nation and forge a more hopeful future for America and for the world . That is the work we began last year . Since the day I took office , we have renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation . We have made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives . We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack , with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence . We have prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula . And in the last year , hundreds of Al Qaida s fighters and affiliates , including many senior leaders , have been captured or killed , far more than in 2008 . And in Afghanistan , we are increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home . We will reward good governance , work to reduce corruption , and support the rights of all Afghans , men and women alike . We are joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose . There will be difficult days ahead , but I am absolutely confident we will succeed . As we take the fight to Al Qaida , we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people . As a candidate , I promised that I would end this war , and that is what I am doing as President . We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August . We will support the Iraqi Government as they hold elections , and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity . But make no mistake This war is ending , and all of our troops are coming home . Tonight all of our men and women in uniform , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , and around the world , they have to know that we that they have our respect , our gratitude , our full support . And just as they must have the resources they need in war , we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home . That is why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year . That is why we are building a 21st century VAnd that is why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families . Now , even as we prosecute two wars , we are also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people , the threat of nuclear weapons . I have embraced the vision of John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them . To reduce our stockpiles and launchers , while ensuring our deterrent , the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades . And at April s Nuclear Security Summit , we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington , Dbehind a clear goal securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists . Now , these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons . That is why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions , sanctions that are being vigorously enforced . That is why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated . And as Iran s leaders continue to ignore their obligations , there should be no doubt They too will face growing consequences . That is a promise . That is the leadership we are providing engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people . We are working through the G 20 to sustain a lasting global recovery . We are working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation . We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change . We are helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV AIDAnd we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease , a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad . As we have for over 60 years , America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores . But we also do it because it is right . That is why , as we meet here tonight , over 10 , 000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild . That is why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan , why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran , why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea . For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity always . Abroad , America s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals . The same is true at home . We find unity in our incredible diversity , drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution The notion that we are all created equal that no matter who you are or what you look like , if you abide by the law , you should be protected by it if you adhere to our common values , you should be treated no different than anyone else . We must continually renew this promise . My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination . We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate . This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are . It is the right thing to do . We are going to crackdown on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal day s work . And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system , to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our Nation . In the end , it is our ideals , our values that built America , values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe , values that drive our citizens still . Every day , Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers . Time and again , they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country . They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit . These are not Republican values or Democratic values that they are living by , business values or labor values , they are American values . Unfortunately , too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions our corporations , our media , and , yes , our Government still reflect these same values . Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper . But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain , people s doubts grow . Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up , we lose faith . The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments , big issues into sound bites , our citizens turn away . No wonder there is so much cynicism out there . No wonder there is so much disappointment . I campaigned on the promise of change . Change we can believe in , the slogan went . And right now I know there are many Americans who are not sure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it . But remember this I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone . Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated . And when you try to do big things and make big changes , it stirs passions and controversy . That is just how it is . Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers . We can do what is necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election , instead of doing what is best for the next generation . But I also know this If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago , we would not be here tonight . The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard , to do what was needed even when success was uncertain , to do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their children and their grandchildren . Now , our administration has had some political setbacks this year , and some of them were deserved . But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year . And what keeps me going , what keeps me fighting , is that despite all these setbacks , that spirit of determination and optimism , that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people , that lives on . It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company , None of us , he said , . . . are willing to consider , even slightly , that we might fail . It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession , We are strong . We are resilient . We are American . It lives on in the 8 year old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti . And it lives on in all the Americans who have dropped everything to go someplace they have never been and pull people they have never known from the rubble , prompting chants of S . A . S . A . S . A when another life was saved . The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries lives on in you , its people . We have finished a difficult year . We have come through a difficult decade . But a new year has come . A new decade stretches before us . We do not quit . I do not quit . Let us seize this moment to start anew , to carry the dream forward , and to strengthen our Union once more . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless the United States of America .Your Majesties , Your Royal Highnesses , distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , citizens of America , and citizens of the world I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility . It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world , we are not mere prisoners of fate . Our actions matter , and can bend history in the direction of justice . And yet I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated . In part , this is because I am at the beginning , and not the end , of my labors on the world stage . Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize Schweitzer and King Marshall and Mandela my accomplishments are slight . And then there are the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics . I cannot argue with those who find these men and women some known , some obscure to all but those they help to be far more deserving of this honor than I . But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander in Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars . One of these wars is winding down . The other is a conflict that America did not seek one in which we are joined by 42 other countries including Norway in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks . Still , we are at war , and I am responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land . Some will kill , and some will be killed . And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace , and our effort to replace one with the other . Now these questions are not new . War , in one form or another , appeared with the first man . At the dawn of history , its morality was not questioned it was simply a fact , like drought or disease the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences . And over time , as codes of law sought to control violence within groups , so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war . The concept of a just war emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met if it is waged as a last resort or in self defense if the force used is proportional and if , whenever possible , civilians are spared from violence . Of course , we know that for most of history , this concept of just war was rarely observed . The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible , as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God . Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred . In the span of 30 years , such carnage would twice engulf this continent . And while it is hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers , World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished . In the wake of such destruction , and with the advent of the nuclear age , it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war . And so , a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace a Marshall Plan and a United Nations , mechanisms to govern the waging of war , treaties to protect human rights , prevent genocide , restrict the most dangerous weapons . In many ways , these efforts succeeded . Yes , terrible wars have been fought , and atrocities committed . But there has been no Third World War . The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall . Commerce has stitched much of the world together . Billions have been lifted from poverty . The ideals of liberty and self determination , equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced . We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past , and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud . And yet , a decade into a new century , this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats . The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers , but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe . Terrorism has long been a tactic , but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale . Moreover , wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations . The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts the growth of secessionist movements , insurgencies , and failed states all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos . In today s wars , many more civilians are killed than soldiers the seeds of future conflict are sown , economies are wrecked , civil societies torn asunder , refugees amassed , children scarred . I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war . What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision , hard work , and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago . And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace . We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes . There will be times when nations acting individually or in concert will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified . I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr . said in this same ceremony years ago Violence never brings permanent peace . It solves no social problem it merely creates new and more complicated ones . As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr . King s life work , I am living testimony to the moral force of non violence . I know there is nothing weak nothing passive nothing na iuml ve in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King . But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation , I cannot be guided by their examples alone . I face the world as it is , and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people . For make no mistake Evil does exist in the world . A non violent movement could not have halted Hitler s armies . Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda s leaders to lay down their arms . To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism it is a recognition of history the imperfections of man and the limits of reason . I raise this point , I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today , no matter what the cause . And at times , this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America , the world s sole military superpower . But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions not just treaties and declarations that brought stability to a post World War II world . Whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms . The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans . We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will . We have done so out of enlightened self interest because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren , and we believe that their lives will be better if others children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity . So yes , the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace . And yet this truth must coexist with another that no matter how justified , war promises human tragedy . The soldier s courage and sacrifice is full of glory , expressing devotion to country , to cause , to comrades in arms . But war itself is never glorious , and we must never trumpet it as such . So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly inreconcilable truths that war is sometimes necessary , and war at some level is an expression of human folly . Concretely , we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago . Let us focus , he said , on a more practical , more attainable peace , based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions . A gradual evolution of human institutions . What might this evolution look like What might these practical steps be To begin with , I believe that all nations strong and weak alike must adhere to standards that govern the use of force . I like any head of state reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation . Nevertheless , I am convinced that adhering to standards , international standards , strengthens those who do , and isolates and weakens those who do not . The world rallied around America after the 9 11 attacks , and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan , because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self defense . Likewise , the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression . Furthermore , America in fact , no nation can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves . For when we do not , our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions , no matter how justified . And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor . More and more , we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government , or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region . I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war . Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later . That is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace . America s commitment to global security will never waver . But in a world in which threats are more diffuse , and missions more complex , America cannot act alone . America alone cannot secure the peace . This is true in Afghanistan . This is true in failed states like Somalia , where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering . And sadly , it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come . The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries , and other friends and allies , demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they have shown in Afghanistan . But in many countries , there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public . I understand why war is not popular , but I also know this The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it . Peace requires responsibility . Peace entails sacrifice . That is why NATO continues to be indispensable . That is why we must strengthen and regional peacekeeping , and not leave the task to a few countries . That is why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome to Ottawa and Sydney to Dhaka and Kigali we honor them not as makers of war , but of wagers but as wagers of peace . Let me make one final point about the use of force . Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war , we must also think clearly about how we fight it . The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant the founder of the Red Cross , and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions . Where force is necessary , we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct . And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules , I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war . That is what makes us different from those whom we fight . That is a source of our strength . That is why I prohibited torture . That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed . And that is why I have reaffirmed America s commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions . We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend . And we honor we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it is easy , but when it is hard . I have spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war . But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices , and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace . First , in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws , I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior for if we want a lasting peace , then the words of the international community must mean something . Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable . Sanctions must exact a real price . Intransigence must be met with increased pressure and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one . One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , and to seek a world without them . In the middle of the last century , nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear All will have access to peaceful nuclear power those without nuclear weapons will forsake them and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament . I am committed to upholding this treaty . It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy . And I am working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia s nuclear stockpiles . But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system . Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted . Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia . Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war . The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people . When there is genocide in Darfur , systematic rape in Congo , repression in Burma there must be consequences . Yes , there will be engagement yes , there will be diplomacy but there must be consequences when those things fail . And the closer we stand together , the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression . This brings me to a second point the nature of the peace that we seek . For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict . Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting . It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War . In the wake of devastation , they recognized that if human rights are not protected , peace is a hollow promise . And yet too often , these words are ignored . For some countries , the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles , foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation s development . And within America , there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world . I reject these choices . I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please choose their own leaders or assemble without fear . Pent up grievances fester , and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence . We also know that the opposite is true . Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace . America has never fought a war against a democracy , and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens . No matter how callously defined , neither America s interests nor the world s are served by the denial of human aspirations . So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries , America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal . We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran . It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation . And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements these movements of hope and history they have us on their side . Let me also say this The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone . At times , it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy . I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation . But I also know that sanctions without outreach condemnation without discussion can carry forward only a crippling status quo . No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door . In light of the Cultural Revolution s horrors , Nixon s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies . Pope John Paul s engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church , but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa . Ronald Reagan s efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union , but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe . There is no simple formula here . But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement , pressure and incentives , so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time . Third , a just peace includes not only civil and political rights it must encompass economic security and opportunity . For true peace is not just freedom from fear , but freedom from want . It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food , or clean water , or the medicine and shelter they need to survive . It does not exist where children cannot aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family . The absence of hope can rot a society from within . And that is why helping farmers feed their own people or nations educate their children and care for the sick is not mere charity . It is also why the world must come together to confront climate change . There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing , we will face more drought , more famine , more mass displacement all of which will fuel more conflict for decades . For this reason , it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action it is military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance . Agreements among nations . Strong institutions . Support for human rights . Investments in development . All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about . And yet , I do not believe that we will have the will , the determination , the staying power , to complete this work without something more and that is the continued expansion of our moral imagination an insistence that there is something irreducible that we all share . As the world grows smaller , you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are to understand that we are all basically seeking the same things that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families . And yet somehow , given the dizzying pace of globalization , the cultural leveling of modernity , it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities their race , their tribe , and perhaps most powerfully their religion . In some places , this fear has led to conflict . At times , it even feels like we are moving backwards . We see it in the Middle East , as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden . We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines . And most dangerously , we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam , and who attacked my country from Afghanistan . These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded . But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war . For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will , then there is no need for restraint no need to spare the pregnant mother , or the medic , or the Red Cross worker , or even a person of one s own faith . Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace , but I believe it is incompatible with the very purpose of faith for the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us . Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature . For we are fallible . We make mistakes , and fall victim to the temptations of pride , and power , and sometimes evil . Even those of us with the best of intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us . But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected . We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place . The non violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance , but the love that they preached their fundamental faith in human progress that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey . For if we lose that faith if we dismiss it as silly or na iuml ve if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace then we lose what is best about humanity . We lose our sense of possibility . We lose our moral compass . Like generations have before us , we must reject that future . As Dr . King said at this occasion so many years ago , I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history . I refuse to accept the idea that the isness of man s present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal oughtness that forever confronts him . Let us reach for the world that ought to be that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls . Somewhere today , in the here and now , in the world as it is , a soldier sees he is outgunned , but stands firm to keep the peace . Somewhere today , in this world , a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government , but has the courage to march on . Somewhere today , a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child , scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child s dreams . Let us live by their example . We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us , and still strive for justice . We can admit the intractability of depravation , and still strive for dignity . Clear eyed , we can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace . We can do that for that is the story of human progress that is the hope of all the world and at this moment of challenge , that must be our work here on Earth . Thank you very much .Thank you very much . Everybody , please have a seat . Thank you very much . Well , thank you . It is good to be back . It is good to be back in New York , it is good to be back in the Great Hall at Cooper Union . We have got some special guests here that I want to acknowledge . Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is here in the house . Governor David Paterson is here . Attorney General Andrew Cuomo . State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is here . The Mayor of New York City , Michael Bloomberg . Dr . George Campbell , Jr . , president of Cooper Union . And all the citywide elected officials who are here . Thank you very much for your attendance . It is wonderful to be back in Cooper Union , where generations of leaders and citizens have come to defend their ideas and contest their differences . It is also good to be back in Lower Manhattan , a few blocks from Wall Street . It really is good to be back , because Wall Street is the heart of our nation s financial sector . Now , since I last spoke here two years ago , our country has been through a terrible trial . More than 8 million people have lost their jobs . Countless small businesses have had to shut their doors . Trillions of dollars in savings have been lost forcing seniors to put off retirement , young people to postpone college , entrepreneurs to give up on the dream of starting a company . And as a nation we were forced to take unprecedented steps to rescue the financial system and the broader economy . And as a result of the decisions we made some of which , let us face it , were very unpopular we are seeing hopeful signs . A little more than one year ago we were losing an average of 750 , 000 jobs each month . Today , America is adding jobs again . One year ago the economy was shrinking rapidly . Today the economy is growing . In fact , we have seen the fastest turnaround in growth in nearly three decades . But you are here and I am here because we have got more work to do . Until this progress is felt not just on Wall Street but on Main Street we cannot be satisfied . Until the millions of our neighbors who are looking for work can find a job , and wages are growing at a meaningful pace , we may be able to claim a technical recovery but we will not have truly recovered . And even as we seek to revive this economy , it is also incumbent on us to rebuild it stronger than before . We do not want an economy that has the same weaknesses that led to this crisis . And that means addressing some of the underlying problems that led to this turmoil and devastation in the first place . Now , one of the most significant contributors to this recession was a financial crisis as dire as any we have known in generations at least since the 30s . And that crisis was born of a failure of responsibility from Wall Street all the way to Washington that brought down many of the world s largest financial firms and nearly dragged our economy into a second Great Depression . It was that failure of responsibility that I spoke about when I came to New York more than two years ago before the worst of the crisis had unfolded . It was back in 2007 . And I take no satisfaction in noting that my comments then have largely been borne out by the events that followed . But I repeat what I said then because it is essential that we learn the lessons from this crisis so we do not doom ourselves to repeat it . And make no mistake , that is exactly what will happen if we allow this moment to pass and that is an outcome that is unacceptable to me and it is unacceptable to you , the American people . As I said on this stage two years ago , I believe in the power of the free market . I believe in a strong financial sector that helps people to raise capital and get loans and invest their savings . That is part of what has made America what it is . But a free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it . That is what happened too often in the years leading up to this crisis . Some and let me be clear , not all but some on Wall Street forgot that behind every dollar traded or leveraged there is family looking to buy a house , or pay for an education , open a business , save for retirement . What happens on Wall Street has real consequences across the country , across our economy . I have spoken before about the need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the 21st century . And given the importance of the financial sector , Wall Street reform is an absolutely essential part of that foundation . Without it , our house will continue to sit on shifting sands , and our families , businesses , and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crises . That is why I feel so strongly that we need to enact a set of updated , commonsense rules to ensure accountability on Wall Street and to protect consumers in our financial system . Now , here s the good news A comprehensive plan to achieve these reforms has already passed the House of Representatives . A Senate version is currently being debated , drawing on ideas from Democrats and Republicans . Both bills represent significant improvement on the flawed rules that we have in place today , despite the furious effort of industry lobbyists to shape this legislation to their special interests . And for those of you in the financial sector I am sure that some of these lobbyists work for you and they are doing what they are being paid to do . But I am here today specifically when I speak to the titans of industry here because I want to urge you to join us , instead of fighting us in this effort . I am here because I believe that these reforms are , in the end , not only in the best interest of our country , but in the best interest of the financial sector . And I am here to explain what reform will look like , and why it matters . Now , first , the bill being considered in the Senate would create what we did not have before , and that is a way to protect the financial system and the broader economy and American taxpayers in the event that a large financial firm begins to fail . If there is a Lehmans or an AIhow can we respond in a way that does not force taxpayers to pick up the tab or , alternatively , could bring down the whole system . In an ordinary local bank when it approaches insolvency , we have got a process , an orderly process through the FDIthat ensures that depositors are protected , maintains confidence in the banking system , and it works . Customers and taxpayers are protected and owners and management lose their equity . But we do not have that kind of process designed to contain the failure of a Lehman Brothers or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country . That is why , when this crisis began , crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world s biggest companies companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets had to take place in hurried discussions in the middle of the night . And that is why , to save the entire economy from an even worse catastrophe , we had to deploy taxpayer dollars . Now , much of that money has now been paid back and my administration has proposed a fee to be paid by large financial firms to recover all the money , every dime , because the American people should never have been put in that position in the first place . But this is why we need a system to shut these firms down with the least amount of collateral damage to innocent people and innocent businesses . And from the start , I have insisted that the financial industry , not taxpayers , shoulder the costs in the event that a large financial company should falter . The goal is to make certain that taxpayers are never again on the hook because a firm is deemed too big to fail . Now , there is a legitimate debate taking place about how best to ensure taxpayers are held harmless in this process . And that is a legitimate debate , and I encourage that debate . But what is not legitimate is to suggest that somehow the legislation being proposed is going to encourage future taxpayer bailouts , as some have claimed . That makes for a good sound bite , but it is not factually accurate . It is not true . In fact , the system as it stands the system as it stands is what led to a series of massive , costly taxpayer bailouts . And it is only with reform that we can avoid a similar outcome in the future . In other words , a vote for reform is a vote to put a stop to taxpayer funded bailouts . That is the truth . End of story . And nobody should be fooled in this debate . By the way , these changes have the added benefit of creating incentives within the industry to ensure that no one company can ever threaten to bring down the whole economy . To that end , the bill would also enact what is known as the Volcker Rule and there is a tall guy sitting in the front row here , Paul Volcker who we named it after . And it does something very simple It places some limits on the size of banks and the kinds of risks that banking institutions can take . This will not only safeguard our system against crises , this will also make our system stronger and more competitive by instilling confidence here at home and across the globe . Markets depend on that confidence . Part of what led to the turmoil of the past two years was that in the absence of clear rules and sound practices , people did not trust that our system was one in which it was safe to invest or lend . As we have seen , that harms all of us . So by enacting these reforms , we will help ensure that our financial system and our economy continues to be the envy of the world . That is the first thing , making sure that we can wind down one firm if it gets into trouble without bringing the whole system down or forcing taxpayers to fund a bailout . Number two , reform would bring new transparency to many financial markets . As you know , part of what led to this crisis was firms like AIG and others who were making huge and risky bets , using derivatives and other complicated financial instruments , in ways that defied accountability , or even common sense . In fact , many practices were so opaque , so confusing , so complex that the people inside the firms did not understand them , much less those who were charged with overseeing them . They were not fully aware of the massive bets that were being placed . That is what led Warren Buffett to describe derivatives that were bought and sold with little oversight as financial weapons of mass destruction . That is what he called them . And that is why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these kinds of transactions take place in the light of day . Now , there is been a great deal of concern about these changes . So I want to reiterate There is a legitimate role for these financial instruments in our economy . They can help allay risk and spur investment . And there are a lot of companies that use these instruments to that legitimate end they are managing exposure to fluctuating prices or currencies , fluctuating markets . For example , a business might hedge against rising oil prices by buying a financial product to secure stable fuel costs , so an airlines might have an interest in locking in a decent price . That is how markets are supposed to work . The problem is these markets operated in the shadows of our economy , invisible to regulators , invisible to the public . So reckless practices were rampant . Risks accrued until they threatened our entire financial system . And that is why these reforms are designed to respect legitimate activities but prevent reckless risk taking . That is why we want to ensure that financial products like standardized derivatives are traded out in the open , in the full view of businesses , investors , and those charged with oversight . And I was encouraged to see a Republican senator join with Democrats this week in moving forward on this issue . That is a good sign . That is a good sign . For without action , we will continue to see what amounts to highly leveraged , loosely monitored gambling in our financial system , putting taxpayers and the economy in jeopardy . And the only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that we are proposing are those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny . Third , this plan would enact the strongest consumer financial protections ever . And that is absolutely necessary because this financial crisis was not just the result of decisions made in the executive suites on Wall Street it was also the result of decisions made around kitchen tables across America , by folks who took on mortgages and credit cards and auto loans . And while it is true that many Americans took on financial obligations that they knew or should have known they could not have afforded , millions of others were , frankly , duped . They were misled by deceptive terms and conditions , buried deep in the fine print . And while a few companies made out like bandits by exploiting their customers , our entire economy was made more vulnerable . Millions of people have now lost their homes . Tens of millions more have lost value in their homes . Just about every sector of our economy has felt the pain , whether you are paving driveways in Arizona , or selling houses in Ohio , or you are doing home repairs in California , or you are using your home equity to start a small business in Florida . That is why we need to give consumers more protection and more power in our financial system . This is not about stifling competition , stifling innovation it is just the opposite . With a dedicated agency setting ground rules and looking out for ordinary people in our financial system , we will empower consumers with clear and concise information when they are making financial decisions . So instead of competing to offer confusing products , companies will compete the old fashioned way , by offering better products . And that will mean more choices for consumers , more opportunities for businesses , and more stability in our financial system . And unless your business model depends on bilking people , there is little to fear from these new rules . Number four , the last key component of reform . These Wall Street reforms will give shareholders new power in the financial system . They will get what we call a say on pay , a voice with respect to the salaries and bonuses awarded to top executives . And the SEC will have the authority to give shareholders more say in corporate elections , so that investors and pension holders have a stronger role in determining who manages the company in which they have placed their savings . Now , Americans do not begrudge anybody for success when that success is earned . But when we read in the past , and sometimes in the present , about enormous executive bonuses at firms even as they are relying on assistance from taxpayers or they are taking huge risks that threaten the system as a whole or their company is doing badly it offends our fundamental values . Not only that , some of the salaries and bonuses that we have seen creates perverse incentives to take reckless risks that contributed to the crisis . It is what helped lead to a relentless focus on a company s next quarter , to the detriment of its next year or its next decade . And it led to a situation in which folks with the most to lose stock and pension holders had the least to say in the process . And that has to change . Let me close by saying this . I have laid out a set of Wall Street reforms . These are reforms that would put an end to taxpayer bailouts that would bring complex financial dealings out of the shadows that would protect consumers and that would give shareholders more power in the financial system . But let us face it , we also need reform in Washington . And the debate the debate over these changes is a perfect example . I mean , we have seen battalions of financial industry lobbyists descending on Capitol Hill , firms spending millions to influence the outcome of this debate . We have seen misleading arguments and attacks that are designed not to improve the bill but to weaken or to kill it . We have seen a bipartisan process buckle under the weight of these withering forces , even as we have produced a proposal that by all accounts is a commonsense , reasonable , non ideological approach to target the root problems that led to the turmoil in our financial sector and ultimately in our entire economy . So we have seen business as usual in Washington , but I believe we can and must put this kind of cynical politics aside . We have got to put an end to it . That is why I am here today . That is why I am here today . And to those of you who are in the financial sector , let me say this , we will not always see eye to eye . We will not always agree . But that does not mean that we have got to choose between two extremes . We do not have to choose between markets that are unfettered by even modest protections against crisis , or markets that are stymied by onerous rules that suppress enterprise and innovation . That is a false choice . And we need no more proof than the crisis that we have just been through . You see , there has always been a tension between the desire to allow markets to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rules to prevent markets from falling out of kilter . But managing that tension , one that we have debated since the founding of this nation , is what has allowed our country to keep up with a changing world . For in taking up this debate , in figuring out how to apply well worn principles with each new age , we ensure that we do not tip too far one way or the other that our democracy remains as dynamic and our economy remains as dynamic as it has in the past . So , yes , this debate can be contentious . It can be heated . But in the end it serves only to make our country stronger . It has allowed us to adapt and to thrive . And I read a report recently that I think fairly illustrates this point . It is from Time Magazine . I am going to quote Through the great banking houses of Manhattan last week ran wild eyed alarm . Big bankers stared at one another in anger and astonishment . A bill just passed hellip would rivet upon their institutions what they considered a monstrous system hellip such a system , they felt , would not only rob them of their pride of profession but would reduce all banking to its lowest level . That appeared in Time Magazine in June of 1933 . The system that caused so much consternation , so much concern was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , also known as the FDIan institution that has successfully secured the deposits of generations of Americans . In the end , our system only works our markets are only free when there are basic safeguards that prevent abuse , that check excesses , that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system . And that is what the reforms we have been proposing are designed to achieve no more , no less . And because that is how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers , that it works for investors , and that it works for financial institutions in other words , that it works for all of us that is why we are working so hard to get this stuff passed . This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history . It is what I said when I spoke here two years ago . Because ultimately , there is no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street . We will rise or we will fall together as one nation . And that is why I urge all of you to join me . I urge all of you to join me , to join those who are seeking to pass these commonsense reforms . And for those of you in the financial industry , I urge you to join me not only because it is in the interest of your industry , but also because it is in the interest of your country . Thank you so much . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America . Thank you .Hello , everybody . I am glad to see that all of you braved the weather to be here . A little while ago I had a meeting with the Democratic and Republican congressional leaders , and it went very well . In fact , I understand that McConnell and Reid are out doing snow angels on the South Lawn together . Can you picture that , Chuck Not really The meeting did go well , and I appreciate them making the trek . We had a good and frank conversation and it is one that I hope we can continue on a more regular basis . We all understand that there are legitimate and genuine differences between the parties , but despite the political posturing that often paralyzes this town , there are many issues upon which we can and should agree . That is what the American people are demanding of us . I think they are tired of every day being Election Day in Washington . And at this critical time in our country , the people sent us here expect a seriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics . That is why I am going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as we work to tackle the pressing challenges ahead . I am confident , for example , that when one in 10 of our fellow citizens cannot work , we should be able to come together and help business create more jobs . We ought to be able to agree on providing small businesses with additional tax credits and much needed lines of credit . We ought to agree on investments in crumbling roads and bridges , and we should agree on tax breaks for making homes more energy efficient all of which will put more Americans to work . Many of the job proposals that I have laid out have passed the House and are soon going to be debated in the Senate . We spent a lot of time in this meeting discussing a jobs package and how we could move forward on that . And if there are additional ideas , I will consider them as well . What I will not consider is doing nothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country . We also talked about restoring fiscal responsibility . There are few matters on which there is as much vigorous bipartisan agreement , at least in public , but unfortunately there is also a lot of partisan wrangling behind closed doors . This is what we know for sure For us to solve this extraordinary problem that is so many years in the making , it is going to take the cooperation of both parties . It is not going to happen in any other way . I am pleased that Congress supported my request to restore the pay as you go rule , which was instrumental in turning deficits into surpluses during the 1990s . I have also called for a bipartisan fiscal commission . Unfortunately this measure , which originally had received the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate and was cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Gregg , Democrats and Republicans , was blocked there . So I am going to be creating this commission by executive order . And during our meeting I asked the leadership of both parties to join in this serious effort to address our long term deficits , because when the politics is put aside , the reality of our fiscal challenge is not subject to interpretation . Math is not partisan . There ought to be a debate about how to close our deficits . What we cannot accept is business as usual , and we cannot afford grandstanding at the expense of actually getting something done . During our meeting we also touched briefly on how we can move forward on health reform . I have already announced that in two weeks I will be holding a meeting with people from both parties , and as I told the congressional leadership , I am looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measured against this test . Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the federal government , which spends a huge amount on health care Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by the insurance industry Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of working Americans who do not have it right now And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability We also talked about why this is so urgent . Just this week , there was a report that Anthem Blue Cross , which is the largest insurer in the largest state , California , is planning on raising premiums for many individual policyholders by as much as 39 percent . If we do not act , this is just a preview of coming attractions . Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance millions more will lose their coverage altogether our deficits will continue to grow larger . And we have an obligation both parties to tackle this issue in a serious way . Now , bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside matters of party for the good of the country . I will not hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friends in the minority party , but I also will not hesitate to condemn what I consider to be obstinacy that is rooted not in substantive disagreements but in political expedience . We talked about this as well , particularly when it comes to the confirmation process . I respect the Senate s role to advise and consent , but for months , qualified , non controversial nominees for critical positions in government , often positions related to our national security , have been held up despite having overwhelming support . My nominee for one important job , the head of General Services Administration , which helps run the government , was denied a vote for nine months . When she finally got a vote on her nomination , she was confirmed 96 to nothing . That is not advise and consent that is delay and obstruct . One senator , as you all are aware , had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmarks in his state . In our meeting , I asked the congressional leadership to put a stop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months . Surely we can set aside partisanship and do what is traditionally been done to confirm these nominations . If the Senate does not act and I made this very clear if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees , I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess , because we cannot afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well functioning government . My hope is that this will be the first of a series of meetings that I have with leadership of both parties in Congress . We have got to get past the tired debates that have plagued our politics and left behind nothing but soaring debt and mounting challenges , greater hardships among the American people , and extraordinary frustrations among the American people . Those frustrations are what led me to run for President , and as long as I am here in Washington , I intend to try to make this government work on their behalf . So , you know , I am going to take a couple of questions , guys . Major . Well , here s how I responded to John in the meeting , and I have said this publicly before . There are some core goals that have to be met . We have got to control costs , both for families and businesses , but also for our government . Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledge that the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending . We cannot deal with our deficits and debt long term unless we get a handle on that . So that has to be part of a package . Number two , we have got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who have got health insurance . And number three , we have got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individual market , as I just mentioned , in California , who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent . That applies to the majority of small businesses , as well as sole proprietors . They are struggling . So I have got these goals . Now , we have a package , as we work through the differences between the House and the Senate , and we will put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time , that meets those criteria , meets those goals . But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans , they indicated , we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost . And I said , great , let me see it . And I have no interest in doing something that is more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way to do it . So I am going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote these goals . What I will not do , what I do not think makes sense and I do not think the American people want to see , would be another year of partisan wrangling around these issues another six months or eight months or nine months worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there is a lot of posturing . Let us get the relevant parties together let us put the best ideas on the table . My hope is that we can find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward , even if I do not get every single thing that I want . But here s the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell Bipartisanship cannot be that I agree to all the things that they believe in or want , and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want , and that is the price of bipartisanship , right But that is sometimes the way it gets presented . Mitch McConnell said something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coal technology and more drilling to increase oil production . Well , of course he likes that that is part of the Republican agenda for energy , which I accept . And I am willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway . But there is got to be some give from their side as well . That is true on health care that is true on energy that is true on financial reform . That is what I am hoping gets accomplished at the summit . What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over the last year . I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills . I think it is important for all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we are moving forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care , that there is complete transparency and all of these issues have been adequately vetted and adequately debated . And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here s what we think we should do , but it also gives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here s our plan here s why we think this will work . And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they did not think that the status quo was acceptable , and that is , right there , promising . That indicates that if all sides agree that we cannot just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done . Well , I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression and people were not sure whether the financial system was going to melt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession . So let us be clear about the sources of uncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years A huge contraction , trillions of dollars of losses in people s 401s people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that they still have not worked out the housing market losing a whole bunch of value . So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6 percent . The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments , and I anticipate that they are going to start hiring at a more rapid clip . What I have also heard is them saying that we would like to feel like Washington is working and able to get some things done . There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty . One way would be to say , well , you know what , we will just go back to what we were doing before on , let us say , the financial markets . We will not have the regulations that we need we will not make any changes in terms of too big to fail . That will provide certainty until the next financial crisis . That is not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need . The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets so that we do not have banks that are too big to fail that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts . That requires legislation . The sooner we can get that done , the better . The same would be true when it comes to health care . A lot of CEOs I hear from will say , boy , we had like you to get health care settled one way or another , but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent , that is the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment . So I guess my answer would be this The sooner the business community has a sense that we have got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big , serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling , I think the better off the entire country is going to be . I absolutely agree on that . What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform , for example , to say , boy , we had be doing fine if we just did not try to regulate the banks . That I think would be a mistake . The small businesses I talk to and I have been talking to a lot of them as I have been traveling around the country over the last several months their biggest problem is right now they cannot get credit out of their banks so they are uncertain about that . And they are still uncertain about orders do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more . It is looking better at this point . But that is not the rationale for people saying , I am not hiring . Let me put it this way . Most small businesses right now , if they have got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll , boost their inventory , and sell to those customers , they will do so . Okay Let us see , let us get a print guy here . David . You know , I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach . What do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy . So we have to move in that direction . What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth , produce jobs , make sure our businesses are competitive around the world , that we are going to need some of the old , traditional energy sources as we are developing these new ones and ramping them up . So we cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy . That just cannot happen . We are going to have needs in these traditional sources . And so the question then is , are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe , secure nuclear power that includes new technologies so that we can use coal which we have in abundance and is very cheap , but often is adding to our greenhouse gases can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy . And my hope is that my Republican friends , but also Democrats , say to themselves , let us be practical and let us do both . Let us not just do one or the other let us do both . Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix . But we have got to do both . I am just a eternal optimist and so it is the right thing to do . And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what is right for the country and assume that over time people , regardless of party , regardless of their particular political positions , are going to gravitate towards the truth . Okay I am going to take two more . Let us see Well , I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here , so go ahead , Chuck . Why is everybody moaning about Todd Well , it is moving along fairly quickly . I think that we have bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can align themselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community . The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide the conversion of some of the low enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need for their medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens . They rejected it although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it is not always clear who is speaking on behalf of the government , and we get a lot of different , mixed signals . But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept . That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization . And that is not acceptable to the international community , not just to the United States . So what we have said from the start was we are moving on dual tracks . If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead you down a path of being a member of good standing , then we welcome you . If not Well , I am getting to that . And if not , then the next step is sanctions . They have made their choice so far , although the door is still open . And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks is developing a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from the international community as a whole . Well , meaning that there is going to be a We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran that their approach is unacceptable . And the will be one aspect of that broader effort . Well , the we are confident right now that the international community is unified around Iran s misbehavior in this area . How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctions is something that we are going to have to see . One thing I am pleased about is to see how forward leaning the Russians have been on this issue . I think they clearly have seen that Iran has not been serious about solving what is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community . All right I am going to make this the last question . And I will take somebody from the back yes . Yes . On health care , the Republicans are asking whether the February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting your side , or will it just be the members of Congress And on Anthem Blue Cross , do you have the authority to go in and tell a private company they cannot charge that how will you stop them Well , I do not have the authority as I understand it I cannot simply issue an executive order lowering everybody s rates . If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of grief on Capitol Hill . That is why reform is so important . That is why the status quo is unacceptable . But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue . I know the American people get frustrated in debating something like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by different groups and different interests . It is a big , complicated , tough issue . But what is also true is that without some action on the part of Congress , it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the current trajectory . And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 percent . The current trajectory is more and more people are losing health care . I do not know if people noted , because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President is trying to take over a government takeover of health care . I do not know if anybody noticed that for the first time this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the private sector not because of anything we did , but because more and more people are losing their health care from their employers . It is becoming unaffordable . That is what we are trying to prevent . We want people to be able to get health care from their employers . But we also understand that you have got to fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to give their employees insurance at an affordable rate . And that is not happening right now . To your question about the 25th , my hope is that this does not end up being political theater , as I think some of you have phrased it . I want a substantive discussion . We have not refined exactly how the agenda is going to go that day . We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what they think would be most useful . I do want to make sure that there is some people like the Congressional Budget Office , for example , that are considered non partisan , who can answer questions . In this whole health care debate I am reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan , who was I guess in an argument with one of his colleagues , and his colleague was losing the argument so he got a little flustered and said to Senator Moynihan , Well , I am entitled to my own opinion . And Senator Moynihan said , Well , you are entitled to your own opinion , but you are not entitled to your own facts . I think that is the key to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care . Let us establish some common facts . Let us establish what the issues are , what the problems are , and let us test out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas do not . And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work , then I think we can make some progress . And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable . So if it is established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those costs , I have said from the beginning of this debate I had be willing to work on that . On the other hand , if I am told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs , then I am also going to insist , okay , let us look at that as one aspect of it , but what else are we willing to do And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier . Bipartisanship cannot mean simply that Democrats give up everything that they believe in , find the handful of things that Republicans have been advocating for and we do those things , and then we have bipartisanship . That is not how it works in any other realm of life . That is certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle , although I usually do give in most of the time . But the there is got to be some give and take , and that is what I am hoping can be accomplished . And I am confident that is what the American people are looking for . So , all right Okay , since there was not a jobs question I will make this the last one , jobs question . Well , my understanding is first of all , the House has moved forward a jobs package that has some good elements in it . My understanding is , is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as we speak on the Senate side about some elements of a package . I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on . Just to give you an example , the idea of eliminating capital gains for small businesses something we can all agree on . I talked about it at the State of the Union address . My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community banks who are lending to small businesses more capital , because that is something that I keep on hearing is one of the biggest problems that small businesses have out there . So I think that it is realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I think need to be done , and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package and so forth . It may take a series of incremental steps , but the one thing I am absolutely clear about is , is that we have got an economy that is growing right now , a huge boost in productivity that is the good news . The bad news is , is that companies still have not taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full time . We are seeing an increase in temporary workers , but they have not yet taken on that full time worker . And so providing some additional impetus to them , right as the economy is moving in a positive direction , I think can end up yielding some good results . All right Thank you , guys . That was pretty good , thanks .Good evening . As we speak , our nation faces a multitude of challenges . At home , our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American . Abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists . And tonight , I have returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we are waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens . On April 20th , an explosion ripped through BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana . Eleven workers lost their lives . Seventeen others were injured . And soon , nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean , oil began spewing into the water . Because there has never been a leak this size at this depth , stopping it has tested the limits of human technology . That is why just after the rig sank , I assembled a team of our nation s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge a team led by Dr . Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize winning physicist and our nation s Secretary of Energy . Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice . As a result of these efforts , we have directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology . And in the coming weeks and days , these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well . This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . Already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days . The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . But make no mistake We will fight this spill with everything we have got for as long as it takes . We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . And we will do whatever s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . Tonight I had like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward what we are doing to clean up the oil , what we are doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf , and what we are doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again . First , the cleanup . From the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation s history an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen , who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters . We now have nearly 30 , 000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil . Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf . And I have authorized the deployment of over 17 , 000 National Guard members along the coast . These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore , they are ready to help clean the beaches , train response workers , or even help with processing claims and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible . Because of our efforts , millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning , skimming and other collection methods . Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil . We have approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore , and we are working with Alabama , Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines . As the cleanup continues , we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need . Now , a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect , and new challenges will always arise . I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip . So if something is not working , we want to hear about it . If there are problems in the operation , we will fix them . But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts , oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife . And sadly , no matter how effective our response is , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . That is why the second thing we are focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . You know , for generations , men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water . That living is now in jeopardy . I have talked to shrimpers and fishermen who do not know how they are going to support their families this year . I have seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected . I have talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back . The sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money they have lost . It is about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost . I refuse to let that happen . Tomorrow , I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company s recklessness . And this fund will not be controlled by BIn order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner , the account must and will be administered by an independent third party . Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term , it is also clear we need a long term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region . The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that is already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats . And the region still has not recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . That is why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment . I make that commitment tonight . Earlier , I asked Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy , who is also a former governor of Mississippi and a son of the Gulf Coast , to develop a long term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible . The plan will be designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists and other Gulf residents . And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region . The third part of our response plan is the steps we are taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again . A few months ago , I approved a proposal to consider new , limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken . That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig , and I want to know why . The American people deserve to know why . The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion these families deserve to know why . And so I have established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place . Already , I have issued a six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue . And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible , I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially . One place we have already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits , known as the Minerals Management Service . Over the last decade , this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves . At this agency , industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight . Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors , and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations . When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior , one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency . But it is now clear that the problem there ran much deeper , and the pace of reform was just too slow . And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency Michael Bromwich , who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General . And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry s watchdog not its partner . So one of the lessons we have learned from this spill is that we need better regulations , better safety standards , and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling . But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry , drilling for oil these days entails greater risk . After all , oil is a finite resource . We consume more than 20 percent of the world s oil , but have less than 2 percent of the world s oil reserves . And that is part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean because we are running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water . For decades , we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered . For decades , we have talked and talked about the need to end America s century long addiction to fossil fuels . And for decades , we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires . Time and again , the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight . Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America . Each day , we send nearly 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . And today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude . We cannot consign our children to this future . The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now . Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash America s innovation and seize control of our own destiny . This is not some distant vision for America . The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time , but over the last year and a half , we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry . As we speak , old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines , people are going back to work installing energy efficient windows , and small businesses are making solar panels . Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks , and families are making their homes more energy efficient . Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries . Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us . As we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs but only if we accelerate that transition . Only if we seize the moment . And only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs scientists and citizens the public and private sectors . When I was a candidate for this office , I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence . Last year , the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America s businesses . Now , there are costs associated with this transition . And there are some who believe that we cannot afford those costs right now . I say we cannot afford not to change how we produce and use energy because the long term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater . So I am happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels . Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks . Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power . Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high tech industry does on research and development and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development . All of these approaches have merit , and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead . But the one approach I will not accept is inaction . The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet . You know , the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War IThe same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon . And yet , time and again , we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom . Instead , what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny our determination to fight for the America we want for our children . Even if we are unsure exactly what that looks like . Even if we do not yet know precisely how we are going to get there . We know we will get there . It is a faith in the future that sustains us as a people . It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now . Each year , at the beginning of shrimping season , the region s fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe . It is called The Blessing of the Fleet , and today it is a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea some for weeks at a time . The ceremony goes on in good times and in bad . It took place after Katrina , and it took place a few weeks ago at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced . And still , they came and they prayed . For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition , The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers . The blessing is that He is with us always , a blessing that is granted even in the midst of the storm . The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face . This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again . What sees us through what has always seen us through is our strength , our resilience , and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it . Tonight , we pray for that courage . We pray for the people of the Gulf . And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day . Thank you , God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .Thank you . Thank you very much . Please , please be seated . To the families of those we have lost to all who called them friends to the students of this university , the public servants who are gathered here , the people of Tucson and the people of Arizona I have come here tonight as an American who , like all Americans , kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow . There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts . But know this The hopes of a nation are here tonight . We mourn with you for the fallen . We join you in your grief . And we add our faith to yours that Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other living victims of this tragedy will pull through . Scripture tells us There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God , the holy place where the Most High dwells . God is within her , she will not fall God will help her at break of day . On Saturday morning , Gabby , her staff and many of her constituents gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech . They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents , so as to carry their concerns back to our nation s capital . Gabby called it Congress on Your Corner just an updated version of government of and by and for the people . And that quintessentially American scene , that was the scene that was shattered by a gunman s bullets . And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday they , too , represented what is best in us , what is best in America . Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years . A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago appointed by President George Bush and rose to become Arizona s chief federal judge . His colleagues described him as the hardest working judge within the Ninth Circuit . He was on his way back from attending Mass , as he did every day , when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative . John is survived by his loving wife , Maureen , his three sons and his five beautiful grandchildren . George and Dorothy Morris Dot to her friends were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters . They did everything together traveling the open road in their Renjoying what their friends called a 50 year honeymoon . Saturday morning , they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say . When gunfire rang out , George , a former Marine , instinctively tried to shield his wife . Both were shot . Dot passed away . A New Jersey native , Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow . But in the summer , she would return East , where her world revolved around her three children , her seven grandchildren and 2 year old great granddaughter . A gifted quilter , she had often work under a favorite tree , or sometimes she had sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants to give out at the church where she volunteered . A Republican , she took a liking to Gabby , and wanted to get to know her better . Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together about 70 years ago . They moved apart and started their own respective families . But after both were widowed they found their way back here , to , as one of Mavy s daughters put it , be boyfriend and girlfriend again . When they were not out on the road in their motor home , you could find them just up the road , helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ . A retired construction worker , Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with his dog , Tux . His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife , sacrificing his life for hers . Everything everything Gabe Zimmerman did , he did with passion . But his true passion was helping people . As Gabby s outreach director , he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own , seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned , that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved , that government was working for ordinary folks . He died doing what he loved talking with people and seeing how he could help . And Gabe is survived by his parents , Ross and Emily , his brother , Ben , and his fianc eacute e , Kelly , who he planned to marry next year . And then there is nine year old Christina Taylor Green . Christina was an A student she was a dancer she was a gymnast she was a swimmer . She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues , and as the only girl on her Little League team , no one put it past her . She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age . She had remind her mother , We are so blessed . We have the best life . And she had pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate . Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing . Our hearts are broken and yet , our hearts also have reason for fullness . Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting , including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday . I have just come from the University Medical Center , just a mile from here , where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak . And I want to tell you her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you right after we went to visit , a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room , Gabby opened her eyes for the first time . Gabby opened her eyes for the first time . Gabby opened her eyes . Gabby opened her eyes , so I can tell you she knows we are here . She knows we love her . And she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey . We are there for her . Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news , and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others . We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez a volunteer in Gabby s office . And , Daniel , I am sorry , you may deny it , but we have decided you are a hero because you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss , and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive . We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload . Right over there . We are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch , who wrestled away the killer s ammunition , and undoubtedly saved some lives . And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal those who d been hurt . We are grateful to them . These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle . They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength . Heroism is here , in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens , all around us , just waiting to be summoned as it was on Saturday morning . Their actions , their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us . It raises a question of what , beyond prayers and expressions of concern , is required of us going forward . How can we honor the fallen How can we be true to their memory You see , when a tragedy like this strikes , it is part of our nature to demand explanations to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless . Already we have seen a national conversation commence , not only about the motivations behind these killings , but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system . And much of this process , of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future , is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self government . But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do it is important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals , not in a way that wounds . Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world , and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding . In the words of Job , When I looked for light , then came darkness . Bad things happen , and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath . For the truth is none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack . None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired , or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man s mind . Yes , we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy . We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence . We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future . But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other . That we cannot do . That we cannot do . As we discuss these issues , let each of us do so with a good dose of humility . Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame , let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations , to listen to each other more carefully , to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together . After all , that is what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family especially if the loss is unexpected . We are shaken out of our routines . We are forced to look inward . We reflect on the past Did we spend enough time with an aging parent , we wonder . Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them , not just once in a while but every single day So sudden loss causes us to look backward but it also forces us to look forward to reflect on the present and the future , on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us . We may ask ourselves if we have shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives . Perhaps we question whether we are doing right by our children , or our community , whether our priorities are in order . We recognize our own mortality , and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth , what matters is not wealth , or status , or power , or fame but rather , how well we have loved and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better . And that process that process of reflection , of making sure we align our values with our actions that , I believe , is what a tragedy like this requires . For those who were harmed , those who were killed they are part of our family , an American family 300 million strong . We may not have known them personally , but surely we see ourselves in them . In George and Dot , in Dorwan and Mavy , we sense the abiding love we have for our own husbands , our own wives , our own life partners . Phyllis she is our mom or our grandma Gabe our brother or son . In Judge Roll , we recognize not only a man who prized his family and doing his job well , but also a man who embodied America s fidelity to the law . And in Gabby in Gabby , we see a reflection of our public spiritedness that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating , sometimes contentious , but always necessary and never ending process to form a more perfect union . And in Christina in Christina we see all of our children . So curious , so trusting , so energetic , so full of magic . So deserving of our love . And so deserving of our good example . If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate as it should let us make sure it is worthy of those we have lost . Let us make sure it is not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle . The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better . To be better in our private lives , to be better friends and neighbors and coworkers and parents . And if , as has been discussed in recent days , their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse , let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy it did not but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way that would make them proud . We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords , who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans , and that we can question each other s ideas without questioning each other s love of country and that our task , working together , is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations . They believed they believed , and I believe that we can be better . Those who died here , those who saved life here they help me believe . We may not be able to stop all evil in the world , but I know that how we treat one another , that is entirely up to us . And I believe that for all our imperfections , we are full of decency and goodness , and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us . That is what I believe , in part because that is what a child like Christina Taylor Green believed . Imagine imagine for a moment , here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship just starting to glimpse the fact that some day she , too , might play a part in shaping her nation s future . She had been elected to her student council . She saw public service as something exciting and hopeful . She was off to meet her congresswoman , someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model . She saw all this through the eyes of a child , undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted . I want to live up to her expectations . I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it . I want America to be as good as she imagined it . All of us we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children s expectations . As has already been mentioned , Christina was given to us on September 11th , 2001 , one of 50 babies born that day to be pictured in a book called Faces of Hope . On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a child s life . I hope you help those in need , read one . I hope you know all the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart . I hope you jump in rain puddles . If there are rain puddles in Heaven , Christina is jumping in them today . And here on this Earth here on this Earth , we place our hands over our hearts , and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle , happy spirit . May God bless and keep those we have lost in restful and eternal peace . May He love and watch over the survivors . And may He bless the United States of America .Good evening . Tonight , I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden , the leader of al Qaeda , and a terrorist who is responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women , and children . It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history . The images of 9 11 are seared into our national memory hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction . And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world . The empty seat at the dinner table . Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father . Parents who would never know the feeling of their child s embrace . Nearly 3 , 000 citizens taken from us , leaving a gaping hole in our hearts . On September 11 , 2001 , in our time of grief , the American people came together . We offered our neighbors a hand , and we offered the wounded our blood . We reaffirmed our ties to each other , and our love of community and country . On that day , no matter where we came from , what God we prayed to , or what race or ethnicity we were , we were united as one American family . We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice . We quickly learned that the 9 11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda an organization headed by Osama bin Laden , which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe . And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens , our friends , and our allies . Over the last 10 years , thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals , we have made great strides in that effort . We have disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense . In Afghanistan , we removed the Taliban government , which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support . And around the globe , we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists , including several who were a part of the 9 11 plot . Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan . Meanwhile , al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world . And so shortly after taking office , I directed Leon Panetta , the director of the CIto make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda , even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat his network . Then , last August , after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community , I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden . It was far from certain , and it took many months to run this thread to ground . I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan . And finally , last week , I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action , and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice . Today , at my direction , the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan . A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability . No Americans were harmed . They took care to avoid civilian casualties . After a firefight , they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body . For over two decades , bin Laden has been al Qaeda s leader and symbol , and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies . The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation s effort to defeat al Qaeda . Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort . There is no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us . We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad . As we do , we must also reaffirm that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam . I have made clear , just as President Bush did shortly after 9 11 , that our war is not against Islam . Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader he was a mass murderer of Muslims . Indeed , al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries , including our own . So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity . Over the years , I have repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was . That is what we have done . But it is important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding . Indeed , bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well , and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people . Tonight , I called President Zardari , and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts . They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations . And going forward , it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates . The American people did not choose this fight . It came to our shores , and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens . After nearly 10 years of service , struggle , and sacrifice , we know well the costs of war . These efforts weigh on me every time as Commander in Chief , have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one , or look into the eyes of a service member who is been gravely wounded . So Americans understand the costs of war . Yet as a country , we will never tolerate our security being threatened , nor stand idly by when our people have been killed . We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies . We will be true to the values that make us who we are . And on nights like this one , we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda s terror Justice has been done . Tonight , we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome . The American people do not see their work , nor know their names . But tonight , they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice . We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation , for they exemplify the professionalism , patriotism , and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country . And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day . Finally , let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9 11 that we have never forgotten your loss , nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores . And tonight , let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9 11 . I know that it has , at times , frayed . Yet today s achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people . The cause of securing our country is not complete . But tonight , we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to . That is the story of our history , whether it is the pursuit of prosperity for our people , or the struggle for equality for all our citizens our commitment to stand up for our values abroad , and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place . Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power , but because of who we are one nation , under God , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . Thank you . May God bless you . And may God bless the United States of America .Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . Please , have a seat . Thank you very much . I want to begin by thanking Hillary Clinton , who has traveled so much these last six months that she is approaching a new landmark one million frequent flyer miles . I count on Hillary every single day , and I believe that she will go down as one of the finest Secretaries of State in our nation s history . The State Department is a fitting venue to mark a new chapter in American diplomacy . For six months , we have witnessed an extraordinary change taking place in the Middle East and North Africa . Square by square , town by town , country by country , the people have risen up to demand their basic human rights . Two leaders have stepped aside . More may follow . And though these countries may be a great distance from our shores , we know that our own future is bound to this region by the forces of economics and security , by history and by faith . Today , I want to talk about this change the forces that are driving it and how we can respond in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security . Now , already , we have done much to shift our foreign policy following a decade defined by two costly conflicts . After years of war in Iraq , we have removed 100 , 000 American troops and ended our combat mission there . In Afghanistan , we have broken the Taliban s momentum , and this July we will begin to bring our troops home and continue a transition to Afghan lead . And after years of war against al Qaeda and its affiliates , we have dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader , Osama bin Laden . Bin Laden was no martyr . He was a mass murderer who offered a message of hate an insistence that Muslims had to take up arms against the West , and that violence against men , women and children was the only path to change . He rejected democracy and individual rights for Muslims in favor of violent extremism his agenda focused on what he could destroy not what he could build . Bin Laden and his murderous vision won some adherents . But even before his death , al Qaeda was losing its struggle for relevance , as the overwhelming majority of people saw that the slaughter of innocents did not answer their cries for a better life . By the time we found bin Laden , al Qaeda s agenda had come to be seen by the vast majority of the region as a dead end , and the people of the Middle East and North Africa had taken their future into their own hands . That story of self determination began six months ago in Tunisia . On December 17th , a young vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi was devastated when a police officer confiscated his cart . This was not unique . It is the same kind of humiliation that takes place every day in many parts of the world the relentless tyranny of governments that deny their citizens dignity . Only this time , something different happened . After local officials refused to hear his complaints , this young man , who had never been particularly active in politics , went to the headquarters of the provincial government , doused himself in fuel , and lit himself on fire . There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building up for years . In America , think of the defiance of those patriots in Boston who refused to pay taxes to a King , or the dignity of Rosa Parks as she sat courageously in her seat . So it was in Tunisia , as that vendor s act of desperation tapped into the frustration felt throughout the country . Hundreds of protesters took to the streets , then thousands . And in the face of batons and sometimes bullets , they refused to go home day after day , week after week until a dictator of more than two decades finally left power . The story of this revolution , and the ones that followed , should not have come as a surprise . The nations of the Middle East and North Africa won their independence long ago , but in too many places their people did not . In too many countries , power has been concentrated in the hands of a few . In too many countries , a citizen like that young vendor had nowhere to turn no honest judiciary to hear his case no independent media to give him voice no credible political party to represent his views no free and fair election where he could choose his leader . And this lack of self determination the chance to make your life what you will has applied to the region s economy as well . Yes , some nations are blessed with wealth in oil and gas , and that has led to pockets of prosperity . But in a global economy based on knowledge , based on innovation , no development strategy can be based solely upon what comes out of the ground . Nor can people reach their potential when you cannot start a business without paying a bribe . In the face of these challenges , too many leaders in the region tried to direct their people s grievances elsewhere . The West was blamed as the source of all ills , a half century after the end of colonialism . Antagonism toward Israel became the only acceptable outlet for political expression . Divisions of tribe , ethnicity and religious sect were manipulated as a means of holding on to power , or taking it away from somebody else . But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore . Satellite television and the Internet provide a window into the wider world a world of astonishing progress in places like India and Indonesia and Brazil . Cell phones and social networks allow young people to connect and organize like never before . And so a new generation has emerged . And their voices tell us that change cannot be denied . In Cairo , we heard the voice of the young mother who said , It is like I can finally breathe fresh air for the first time . In Sanaa , we heard the students who chanted , The night must come to an end . In Benghazi , we heard the engineer who said , Our words are free now . It is a feeling you cannot explain . In Damascus , we heard the young man who said , After the first yelling , the first shout , you feel dignity . Those shouts of human dignity are being heard across the region . And through the moral force of nonviolence , the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than terrorists have accomplished in decades . Of course , change of this magnitude does not come easily . In our day and age a time of 24 hour news cycles and constant communication people expect the transformation of the region to be resolved in a matter of weeks . But it will be years before this story reaches its end . Along the way , there will be good days and there will bad days . In some places , change will be swift in others , gradual . And as we have already seen , calls for change may give way , in some cases , to fierce contests for power . The question before us is what role America will play as this story unfolds . For decades , the United States has pursued a set of core interests in the region countering terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons securing the free flow of commerce and safe guarding the security of the region standing up for Israel s security and pursuing Arab Israeli peace . We will continue to do these things , with the firm belief that America s interests are not hostile to people s hopes they are essential to them . We believe that no one benefits from a nuclear arms race in the region , or al Qaeda s brutal attacks . We believe people everywhere would see their economies crippled by a cut off in energy supplies . As we did in the Gulf War , we will not tolerate aggression across borders , and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners . Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind . Moreover , failure to speak to the broader aspirations of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that has festered for years that the United States pursues our interests at their expense . Given that this mistrust runs both ways as Americans have been seared by hostage taking and violent rhetoric and terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of our citizens a failure to change our approach threatens a deepening spiral of division between the United States and the Arab world . And that is why , two years ago in Cairo , I began to broaden our engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect . I believed then and I believe now that we have a stake not just in the stability of nations , but in the self determination of individuals . The status quo is not sustainable . Societies held together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time , but they are built upon fault lines that will eventually tear asunder . So we face a historic opportunity . We have the chance to show that America values the dignity of the street vendor in Tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator . There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self determination and opportunity . Yes , there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise . But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region , we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be . Of course , as we do , we must proceed with a sense of humility . It is not America that put people into the streets of Tunis or Cairo it was the people themselves who launched these movements , and it is the people themselves that must ultimately determine their outcome . Not every country will follow our particular form of representative democracy , and there will be times when our short term interests do not align perfectly with our long term vision for the region . But we can , and we will , speak out for a set of core principles principles that have guided our response to the events over the past six months The United States opposes the use of violence and repression against the people of the region . The United States supports a set of universal rights . And these rights include free speech , the freedom of peaceful assembly , the freedom of religion , equality for men and women under the rule of law , and the right to choose your own leaders whether you live in Baghdad or Damascus , Sanaa or Tehran . And we support political and economic reform in the Middle East and North Africa that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region . Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest . Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions , and supported by all of the diplomatic , economic and strategic tools at our disposal . Let me be specific . First , it will be the policy of the United States to promote reform across the region , and to support transitions to democracy . That effort begins in Egypt and Tunisia , where the stakes are high as Tunisia was at the vanguard of this democratic wave , and Egypt is both a longstanding partner and the Arab world s largest nation . Both nations can set a strong example through free and fair elections , a vibrant civil society , accountable and effective democratic institutions , and responsible regional leadership . But our support must also extend to nations where transitions have yet to take place . Unfortunately , in too many countries , calls for change have thus far been answered by violence . The most extreme example is Libya , where Muammar Qaddafi launched a war against his own people , promising to hunt them down like rats . As I said when the United States joined an international coalition to intervene , we cannot prevent every injustice perpetrated by a regime against its people , and we have learned from our experience in Iraq just how costly and difficult it is to try to impose regime change by force no matter how well intentioned it may be . But in Libya , we saw the prospect of imminent massacre , we had a mandate for action , and heard the Libyan people s call for help . Had we not acted along with our NATO allies and regional coalition partners , thousands would have been killed . The message would have been clear Keep power by killing as many people as it takes . Now , time is working against Qaddafi . He does not have control over his country . The opposition has organized a legitimate and credible Interim Council . And when Qaddafi inevitably leaves or is forced from power , decades of provocation will come to an end , and the transition to a democratic Libya can proceed . While Libya has faced violence on the greatest scale , it is not the only place where leaders have turned to repression to remain in power . Most recently , the Syrian regime has chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens . The United States has condemned these actions , and working with the international community we have stepped up our sanctions on the Syrian regime including sanctions announced yesterday on President Assad and those around him . The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy . President Assad now has a choice He can lead that transition , or get out of the way . The Syrian government must stop shooting demonstrators and allow peaceful protests . It must release political prisoners and stop unjust arrests . It must allow human rights monitors to have access to cities like Dara a and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition . Otherwise , President Assad and his regime will continue to be challenged from within and will continue to be isolated abroad . So far , Syria has followed its Iranian ally , seeking assistance from Tehran in the tactics of suppression . And this speaks to the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime , which says it stand for the rights of protesters abroad , yet represses its own people at home . Let us remember that the first peaceful protests in the region were in the streets of Tehran , where the government brutalized women and men , and threw innocent people into jail . We still hear the chants echo from the rooftops of Tehran . The image of a young woman dying in the streets is still seared in our memory . And we will continue to insist that the Iranian people deserve their universal rights , and a government that does not smother their aspirations . Now , our opposition to Iran s intolerance and Iran s repressive measures , as well as its illicit nuclear program and its support of terror , is well known . But if America is to be credible , we must acknowledge that at times our friends in the region have not all reacted to the demands for consistent change with change that is consistent with the principles that I have outlined today . That is true in Yemen , where President Saleh needs to follow through on his commitment to transfer power . And that is true today in Bahrain . Bahrain is a longstanding partner , and we are committed to its security . We recognize that Iran has tried to take advantage of the turmoil there , and that the Bahraini government has a legitimate interest in the rule of law . Nevertheless , we have insisted both publicly and privately that mass arrests and brute force are at odds with the universal rights of Bahrain s citizens , and we will and such steps will not make legitimate calls for reform go away . The only way forward is for the government and opposition to engage in a dialogue , and you cannot have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful opposition are in jail . The government must create the conditions for dialogue , and the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all Bahrainis . Indeed , one of the broader lessons to be drawn from this period is that sectarian divides need not lead to conflict . In Iraq , we see the promise of a multiethnic , multisectarian democracy . The Iraqi people have rejected the perils of political violence in favor of a democratic process , even as they have taken full responsibility for their own security . Of course , like all new democracies , they will face setbacks . But Iraq is poised to play a key role in the region if it continues its peaceful progress . And as they do , we will be proud to stand with them as a steadfast partner . So in the months ahead , America must use all our influence to encourage reform in the region . Even as we acknowledge that each country is different , we need to speak honestly about the principles that we believe in , with friend and foe alike . Our message is simple If you take the risks that reform entails , you will have the full support of the United States . We must also build on our efforts to broaden our engagement beyond elites , so that we reach the people who will shape the future particularly young people . We will continue to make good on the commitments that I made in Cairo to build networks of entrepreneurs and expand exchanges in education , to foster cooperation in science and technology , and combat disease . Across the region , we intend to provide assistance to civil society , including those that may not be officially sanctioned , and who speak uncomfortable truths . And we will use the technology to connect with and listen to the voices of the people . For the fact is , real reform does not come at the ballot box alone . Through our efforts we must support those basic rights to speak your mind and access information . We will support open access to the Internet , and the right of journalists to be heard whether it is a big news organization or a lone blogger . In the 21st century , information is power , the truth cannot be hidden , and the legitimacy of governments will ultimately depend on active and informed citizens . Such open discourse is important even if what is said does not square with our worldview . Let me be clear , America respects the right of all peaceful and law abiding voices to be heard , even if we disagree with them . And sometimes we profoundly disagree with them . We look forward to working with all who embrace genuine and inclusive democracy . What we will oppose is an attempt by any group to restrict the rights of others , and to hold power through coercion and not consent . Because democracy depends not only on elections , but also strong and accountable institutions , and the respect for the rights of minorities . Such tolerance is particularly important when it comes to religion . In Tahrir Square , we heard Egyptians from all walks of life chant , Muslims , Christians , we are one . America will work to see that this spirit prevails that all faiths are respected , and that bridges are built among them . In a region that was the birthplace of three world religions , intolerance can lead only to suffering and stagnation . And for this season of change to succeed , Coptic Christians must have the right to worship freely in Cairo , just as Shia must never have their mosques destroyed in Bahrain . What is true for religious minorities is also true when it comes to the rights of women . History shows that countries are more prosperous and more peaceful when women are empowered . And that is why we will continue to insist that universal rights apply to women as well as men by focusing assistance on child and maternal health by helping women to teach , or start a business by standing up for the right of women to have their voices heard , and to run for office . The region will never reach its full potential when more than half of its population is prevented from achieving their full potential . Now , even as we promote political reform , even as we promote human rights in the region , our efforts cannot stop there . So the second way that we must support positive change in the region is through our efforts to advance economic development for nations that are transitioning to democracy . After all , politics alone has not put protesters into the streets . The tipping point for so many people is the more constant concern of putting food on the table and providing for a family . Too many people in the region wake up with few expectations other than making it through the day , perhaps hoping that their luck will change . Throughout the region , many young people have a solid education , but closed economies leave them unable to find a job . Entrepreneurs are brimming with ideas , but corruption leaves them unable to profit from those ideas . The greatest untapped resource in the Middle East and North Africa is the talent of its people . In the recent protests , we see that talent on display , as people harness technology to move the world . It is no coincidence that one of the leaders of Tahrir Square was an executive for Google . That energy now needs to be channeled , in country after country , so that economic growth can solidify the accomplishments of the street . For just as democratic revolutions can be triggered by a lack of individual opportunity , successful democratic transitions depend upon an expansion of growth and broad based prosperity . So , drawing from what we have learned around the world , we think it is important to focus on trade , not just aid on investment , not just assistance . The goal must be a model in which protectionism gives way to openness , the reigns of commerce pass from the few to the many , and the economy generates jobs for the young . America s support for democracy will therefore be based on ensuring financial stability , promoting reform , and integrating competitive markets with each other and the global economy . And we are going to start with Tunisia and Egypt . First , we have asked the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to present a plan at next week s G8 summit for what needs to be done to stabilize and modernize the economies of Tunisia and Egypt . Together , we must help them recover from the disruptions of their democratic upheaval , and support the governments that will be elected later this year . And we are urging other countries to help Egypt and Tunisia meet its near term financial needs . Second , we do not want a democratic Egypt to be saddled by the debts of its past . So we will relieve a democratic Egypt of up to 1 billion in debt , and work with our Egyptian partners to invest these resources to foster growth and entrepreneurship . We will help Egypt regain access to markets by guaranteeing 1 billion in borrowing that is needed to finance infrastructure and job creation . And we will help newly democratic governments recover assets that were stolen . Third , we are working with Congress to create Enterprise Funds to invest in Tunisia and Egypt . And these will be modeled on funds that supported the transitions in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall . OPIC will soon launch a 2 billion facility to support private investment across the region . And we will work with the allies to refocus the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development so that it provides the same support for democratic transitions and economic modernization in the Middle East and North Africa as it has in Europe . Fourth , the United States will launch a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership Initiative in the Middle East and North Africa . If you take out oil exports , this entire region of over 400 million people exports roughly the same amount as Switzerland . So we will work with the EU to facilitate more trade within the region , build on existing agreements to promote integration with and European markets , and open the door for those countries who adopt high standards of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement . And just as EU membership served as an incentive for reform in Europe , so should the vision of a modern and prosperous economy create a powerful force for reform in the Middle East and North Africa . Prosperity also requires tearing down walls that stand in the way of progress the corruption of elites who steal from their people the red tape that stops an idea from becoming a business the patronage that distributes wealth based on tribe or sect . We will help governments meet international obligations , and invest efforts at anti corruption by working with parliamentarians who are developing reforms , and activists who use technology to increase transparency and hold government accountable . Politics and human rights economic reform . Let me conclude by talking about another cornerstone of our approach to the region , and that relates to the pursuit of peace . For decades , the conflict between Israelis and Arabs has cast a shadow over the region . For Israelis , it has meant living with the fear that their children could be blown up on a bus or by rockets fired at their homes , as well as the pain of knowing that other children in the region are taught to hate them . For Palestinians , it has meant suffering the humiliation of occupation , and never living in a nation of their own . Moreover , this conflict has come with a larger cost to the Middle East , as it impedes partnerships that could bring greater security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people . For over two years , my administration has worked with the parties and the international community to end this conflict , building on decades of work by previous administrations . Yet expectations have gone unmet . Israeli settlement activity continues . Palestinians have walked away from talks . The world looks at a conflict that has grinded on and on and on , and sees nothing but stalemate . Indeed , there are those who argue that with all the change and uncertainty in the region , it is simply not possible to move forward now . I disagree . At a time when the people of the Middle East and North Africa are casting off the burdens of the past , the drive for a lasting peace that ends the conflict and resolves all claims is more urgent than ever . That is certainly true for the two parties involved . For the Palestinians , efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure . Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September will not create an independent state . Palestinian leaders will not achieve peace or prosperity if Hamas insists on a path of terror and rejection . And Palestinians will never realize their independence by denying the right of Israel to exist . As for Israel , our friendship is rooted deeply in a shared history and shared values . Our commitment to Israel s security is unshakeable . And we will stand against attempts to single it out for criticism in international forums . But precisely because of our friendship , it is important that we tell the truth The status quo is unsustainable , and Israel too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace . The fact is , a growing number of Palestinians live west of the Jordan River . Technology will make it harder for Israel to defend itself . A region undergoing profound change will lead to populism in which millions of people not just one or two leaders must believe peace is possible . The international community is tired of an endless process that never produces an outcome . The dream of a Jewish and democratic state cannot be fulfilled with permanent occupation . Now , ultimately , it is up to the Israelis and Palestinians to take action . No peace can be imposed upon them not by the United States not by anybody else . But endless delay will not make the problem go away . What America and the international community can do is to state frankly what everyone knows a lasting peace will involve two states for two peoples Israel as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people , and the state of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people , each state enjoying self determination , mutual recognition , and peace . So while the core issues of the conflict must be negotiated , the basis of those negotiations is clear a viable Palestine , a secure Israel . The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states , with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel , Jordan , and Egypt , and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine . We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps , so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states . The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves , and reach their full potential , in a sovereign and contiguous state . As for security , every state has the right to self defense , and Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat . Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism , to stop the infiltration of weapons , and to provide effective border security . The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign , non militarized state . And the duration of this transition period must be agreed , and the effectiveness of security arrangements must be demonstrated . These principles provide a foundation for negotiations . Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met . I am aware that these steps alone will not resolve the conflict , because two wrenching and emotional issues will remain the future of Jerusalem , and the fate of Palestinian refugees . But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair , and that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians . Now , let me say this Recognizing that negotiations need to begin with the issues of territory and security does not mean that it will be easy to come back to the table . In particular , the recent announcement of an agreement between Fatah and Hamas raises profound and legitimate questions for Israel How can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist And in the weeks and months to come , Palestinian leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question . Meanwhile , the United States , our Quartet partners , and the Arab states will need to continue every effort to get beyond the current impasse . I recognize how hard this will be . Suspicion and hostility has been passed on for generations , and at times it has hardened . But I am convinced that the majority of Israelis and Palestinians would rather look to the future than be trapped in the past . We see that spirit in the Israeli father whose son was killed by Hamas , who helped start an organization that brought together Israelis and Palestinians who had lost loved ones . That father said , I gradually realized that the only hope for progress was to recognize the face of the conflict . We see it in the actions of a Palestinian who lost three daughters to Israeli shells in Gaza . I have the right to feel angry , he said . So many people were expecting me to hate . My answer to them is I shall not hate . Let us hope , he said , for tomorrow . That is the choice that must be made not simply in the Israeli Palestinian conflict , but across the entire region a choice between hate and hope between the shackles of the past and the promise of the future . It is a choice that must be made by leaders and by the people , and it is a choice that will define the future of a region that served as the cradle of civilization and a crucible of strife . For all the challenges that lie ahead , we see many reasons to be hopeful . In Egypt , we see it in the efforts of young people who led protests . In Syria , we see it in the courage of those who brave bullets while chanting , peaceful , peaceful . In Benghazi , a city threatened with destruction , we see it in the courthouse square where people gather to celebrate the freedoms that they had never known . Across the region , those rights that we take for granted are being claimed with joy by those who are prying loose the grip of an iron fist . For the American people , the scenes of upheaval in the region may be unsettling , but the forces driving it are not unfamiliar . Our own nation was founded through a rebellion against an empire . Our people fought a painful Civil War that extended freedom and dignity to those who were enslaved . And I would not be standing here today unless past generations turned to the moral force of nonviolence as a way to perfect our union organizing , marching , protesting peacefully together to make real those words that declared our nation We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal . Those words must guide our response to the change that is transforming the Middle East and North Africa words which tell us that repression will fail , and that tyrants will fall , and that every man and woman is endowed with certain inalienable rights . It will not be easy . There is no straight line to progress , and hardship always accompanies a season of hope . But the United States of America was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves . And now we cannot hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights , knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful , more stable , and more just . Thank you very much , everybody . Thank you .Hello , Connecticut . Thank you . Well , thank you so much , everybody . Let me begin by thanking Nicole , and Ian , for your brave words . I want to thank them and all the Newtown families who have come here today , including your First Selectman , Pat Llodra . Nobody could be more eloquent than Nicole and the other families on this issue . And we are so grateful for their courage and willingness to share their stories again and again , understanding that nothing is going to be more important in making sure the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them . I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well the survivors THE PRESIDENT I love you back . I do . the survivors who still mourn and grieve , but are still going to work every day to love and raise those precious children in their care as fiercely as ever . I want to thank Governor Malloy for his leadership . Very proud of him . I want to thank the University of Hartford for hosting us this afternoon . Thank you , Hawks . And I want to thank the people of Connecticut for everything you have done to honor the memories of the victims because you are part of their family as well . One of your recent alumni , Rachel D Avino , was a behavioral therapist at Sandy Hook . Two alumni of your performing arts school , Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez Greene , lost their daughter , Ana an incredible , vibrant young girl who looked up to them , and learned from them , and inherited their talents by singing before she could talk . So every family in this state was shaken by the tragedy of that morning . Every family in this country was shaken . We hugged our kids more tightly . We asked what could we do , as a society , to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again . And as a society , we decided that we have to change . We must . We must change . I noticed that Nicole and others refer to that day as 12 14 . For these families , it was a day that changed everything . And I know many of you in Newtown wondered if the rest of us would live up to the promise we made in those dark days if we had change , too or if once the television trucks left , once the candles flickered out , once the teddy bears were carefully gathered up , that the country would somehow move on to other things . Over the weekend , I heard Francine Wheeler , who lost her son Ben that day , say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some , but for her , it feels like it is been years since she saw Ben . And she is determined not to let what happened that day just fade away . We are not going anywhere , she said . We are here . And we are going to be here . And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown , everybody who was impacted . And , Newtown , we want you to know that we are here with you . We will not walk away from the promises we have made . We are as determined as ever to do what must be done . In fact , I am here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done . We are not forgetting . We cannot forget . Your families still grieve in ways most of us cannot comprehend . But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference not just to honor your own children , but to protect the lives of all of our children . So many of you have mobilized , and organized , and petitioned your elected officials with love and logic , as Nicole put it as citizens determined to right something gone wrong . And last week , here in Connecticut , your elected leaders responded . The Connecticut legislature , led by many of the legislators here today , passed new measures to protect more of our children and our communities from gun violence . And Governor Malloy signed that legislation into law . So I want to be clear . You , the families of Newtown , people across Connecticut , you helped make that happen . Your voices , your determination made that happen . Obviously , the elected leaders did an extraordinary job moving it forward , but it could not have happened if they were not hearing from people in their respective districts , people all across the state . That is the power of your voice . And , by the way , Connecticut is not alone . In the past few months , New York , Colorado , Maryland have all passed new , common sense gun safety reforms as well . These are all states that share an awful familiarity with gun violence , whether it is the horror of mass killings , or the street crime that is too common in too many neighborhoods . All of these states also share a strong tradition of hunting , and sport shooting , and gun ownership . It is been a part of the fabric of people s lives for generations . And every single one of those states including here in Connecticut decided that , yes , we can protect more of our citizens from gun violence while still protecting our Second Amendment rights . Those two things do not contradict each other . We can pass common sense laws that protect our kids and protect our rights . So Connecticut has shown the way . And now is the time for Congress to do the same . Now is the time for Congress to do the same . This week is the time for Congress to do the same . Now , back in January , just a few months after the tragedy in Newtown , I announced a series of executive actions to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe . And I put forward common sense proposals much like those that passed here in Connecticut for Congress to consider . And you will remember in my State of the Union address , I urged Congress to give those proposals a vote . And that moment is now . As soon as this week , Congress will begin debating these common sense proposals to reduce gun violence . Your senators , Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy they are here your Representatives , John Larson , Rosa DeLauro , Elizabeth Esty , Jim Hines , Joe Courtney , they are all pushing to pass this legislation . But much of Congress is going to only act if they hear from you , the American people . So here s what we have to do . I appreciate that . Here s what we have got to do . We have to tell Congress it is time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others cannot get their hands on a gun . Let us make that happen . We have to tell Congress it is time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folks will think twice before buying a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who will not pass a background check . Let us get that done . We have to tell Congress it is time to restore the ban on military style assault weapons , and a 10 round limit for magazines , to make it harder for a gunman to fire 154 bullets into his victims in less than five minutes . Let us put that to a vote . We have to tell Congress it is time to strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment they need before it is too late . Let us do that for our kids and for our communities . Now , I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others , but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people . All of them are common sense . All of them deserve a vote . All of them deserve a vote . Consider background checks . Over the past 20 years , background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun . A group of police officers in Colorado told me last week that , thanks to background checks , they have been able to stop convicted murderers , folks under restraining orders for committing violent domestic abuse from buying a gun . In some cases , they have actually arrested the person as they were coming to purchase the gun . So we know that background checks can work . But the problem is loopholes in the current law let so many people avoid background checks altogether . That is not safe . It does not make sense . If you are a law abiding citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun , would not you expect other people to play by the same rules If you are a law abiding gun seller , would not you want to know you are not selling your gun to someone who is likely to commit a crime Should not we make it harder , not easier for somebody who is convicted of domestic abuse to get his hands on a gun It turns out 90 percent of Americans think so . Ninety percent of Americans support universal background checks . Think about that . How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything And yet , 90 percent agree on this Republicans , Democrats , folks who own guns , folks who do not own guns 80 percent of Republicans , more than 80 percent of gun owners , more than 70 percent of NRA households . It is common sense . And yet , there is only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on , and that is politics in Washington . You would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to make this happen . That is what you would think . If our democracy is working the way it is supposed to , and 90 percent of the American people agree on something , in the wake of a tragedy you had think this would not be a heavy lift . And yet , some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms . Think about that . They are not just saying they will vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support . They are saying they will do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions . They are saying your opinion does not matter . And that is not right . That is not right . We need a vote . We need a vote . Now , I have also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me . Connecticut , this is not about me . This is not about politics . This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence . It is about them and all the families going forward , so we can prevent this from happening again . That is what it is about . It is about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk . That is what this is about . This is not about politics . This is not about politics . This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let us make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down . When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote that families of Newtown , and Aurora , and Tucson , and a former member of Congress , Gabby Giffords , that they all deserved a vote virtually every member of that chamber stood up and applauded . And now they are going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do You deserve better than that . You deserve a vote . Now , look , we knew from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy . We knew that there would be powerful interests that are very good at confusing the subject , that are good at amplifying conflict and extremes , that are good at drowning out rational debate , good at ginning up irrational fears , all of which stands in the way of progress . But if our history teaches us anything , then it is up to us the people to stand up to those who say we cannot , or we will not stand up for the change that we need . And I believe that that is what the American people are looking for . When I first ran for this office , I said that I did not believe the country was as divided as our politics would suggest , and I still believe that . I know sometimes , when you watch cable news or talk radio , or you browse the Internet , you had think , man , everybody just hates each other , everybody is just at each other s throats . But that is not how most Americans think about these issues . There are good people on both sides of every issue . So if we are going to move forward , we cannot just talk past one another . We have got to listen to one another . That is what Governor Malloy and all these legislative leaders did . That is why they were able to pass bipartisan legislation . I have got stacks of letters from gun owners who want me to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arms , do not want them infringed upon , and I appreciate every one of those letters . I have learned from them . But a lot of those letters , what they have also said is they are not just gun owners they are also parents or police officers or veterans , and they agree that we cannot stand by and keep letting these tragedies happen that with our rights come some responsibilities and obligations to our communities and ourselves , and most of all to our children . We cannot just think about us we have got to think about we , the people . I was in Colorado . I told a story about Michelle . She came back from a trip to rural Iowa we were out there campaigning . Sometimes it would be miles between farms , let alone towns . And she said , you know , coming back , I can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection . If somebody drove up into the driveway and , Barack , you were not home , the sheriff lived miles away , I might want that security . So she can understand what it might be like in terms of somebody wanting that kind of security . On the other hand , I also talked to a hunter last week who said , all my experiences with guns have been positive , but I also realize that for others , all their experiences with guns have been negative . And when he said that , I thought about the mom I met from suburban Chicago whose son was killed in a random shooting . And this mom told me , I hate it when people tell me that my son was in the wrong place at the wrong time . He was on his way to school . He was exactly where he was supposed to be . He was in the right place at the right time , and he still got shot . The kids at Sandy Hook were where they were supposed to be . So were those moviegoers in Aurora . So were those worshippers in Oak Creek . So was Gabby Giffords . She was at a supermarket , listening to the concerns of her constituents . They were exactly where they were supposed to be . They were also exercising their rights to assemble peaceably to worship freely and safely . They were exercising the rights of life and liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . So surely , we can reconcile those two things . Surely , America does not have to be divided between rural and urban , and Democrat and Republican when it comes to something like this . If you are an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known , then we have to act . Now is the time to get engaged . Now is the time to get involved . Now is the time to push back on fear , and frustration , and misinformation . Now is the time for everybody to make their voices heard from every state house to the corridors of Congress . And I am asking everyone listening today , find out where your member of Congress stands on this . If they are not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks , then ask them , why not Why would not you want to make it easier for law enforcement to do their job Why would not you want to make it harder for a dangerous person to get his or her hands on a gun What is more important to you our children , or an A grade from the gun lobby I have heard Nicole talk about what her life has been like since Dylan was taken from her in December . And one thing she said struck me . She said , Every night , I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again . And during the day , I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change . Now , if Nicole can summon the courage to do that , how can the rest of us do any less How can we do any less If there is even one thing we can do to protect our kids , do not we have an obligation to try If there is even one step we can take to keep somebody from murdering dozens of innocents in the span of minutes , should not we be taking that step If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child , is not that worth fighting for I have got to tell you , I have had tough days in the presidency I have said this before . The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my presidency . But I have got to tell you , if we do not respond to this , that will be a tough day for me , too . Because we have got to expect more from ourselves , and we have got to expect more from Congress . We have got to believe that every once in a while , we set politics aside and we just do what is right . We have got to believe that . And if you believe that , I am asking you to stand up . If you believe in the right to bears arms , like I do , but think we should prevent an irresponsible few from inflicting harm stand up . Stand up . If you believe that the families of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Virginia Tech and the thousands of Americans who have been gunned down in the last four months deserve a vote , we all have to stand up . If you want the people you send to Washington to have just an iota of the courage that the educators at Sandy Hook showed when danger arrived on their doorstep , then we are all going to have to stand up . And if we do , if we come together and raise our voices together and demand this change together , I am convinced cooperation and common sense will prevail . We will find sensible , intelligent ways to make this country stronger and safer for our children . So let us do the right thing . Let us do right by our kids . Let us do right by these families . Let us get this done . Connecticut , thank you . God bless you . God bless the United States of America .Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans Today in America , a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it , and did her part to lift America s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades . An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup , and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years . An autoworker fine tuned some of the best , most fuel efficient cars in the world , and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil . A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five year stretch of farm exports in our history . A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford . A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift , bone tired but dreaming big dreams for his son . And in tight knit communities across America , fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids , put an arm around their spouse , remember fallen comrades , and give thanks for being home from a war that , after twelve long years , is finally coming to an end . Tonight , this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you , our citizens , who make the state of our union strong . Here are the results of your efforts The lowest unemployment rate in over five years . A rebounding housing market . A manufacturing sector that is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s . More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time that is happened in nearly twenty years . Our deficits cut by more than half . And for the first time in over a decade , business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world s number one place to invest America is . That is why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America . After five years of grit and determined effort , the United States is better positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth . The question for everyone in this chamber , running through every decision we make this year , is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress . For several years now , this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government . It is an important debate one that dates back to our very founding . But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States then we are not doing right by the American people . As President , I am committed to making Washington work better , and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here . I believe most of you are , too . Last month , thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans , this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year s severe cuts to priorities like education . Nobody got everything they wanted , and we can still do more to invest in this country s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way . But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs , not creating new crises . In the coming months , let us see where else we can make progress together . Let us make this a year of action . That is what most Americans want for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations . And what I believe unites the people of this nation , regardless of race or region or party , young or old , rich or poor , is the simple , profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility , you can get ahead . Let us face it that belief has suffered some serious blows . Over more than three decades , even before the Great Recession hit , massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good , middle class jobs , and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on . Today , after four years of economic growth , corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher , and those at the top have never done better . But average wages have barely budged . Inequality has deepened . Upward mobility has stalled . The cold , hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery , too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by let alone get ahead . And too many still are not working at all . Our job is to reverse these trends . It will not happen right away , and we will not agree on everything . But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete , practical proposals to speed up growth , strengthen the middle class , and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class . Some require Congressional action , and I am eager to work with all of you . But America does not stand still and neither will So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families , that is what I am going to do . As usual , our First Lady sets a good example . Michelle s Let us Move partnership with schools , businesses , and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come . The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400 , 000 veterans and military spouses . Taking a page from that playbook , the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already , 150 universities , businesses , and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus . Across the country , we are partnering with mayors , governors , and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality . The point is , there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments , and are moving this country forward . They believe , and I believe , that here in America , our success should depend not on accident of birth , but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams . That is what drew our forebears here . It is how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America s largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth . Opportunity is who we are . And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise . We know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job . With the economy picking up speed , companies say they intend to hire more people this year . And over half of big manufacturers say they are thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad . So let us make that decision easier for more companies . Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful , complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here , and reward companies that keep profits abroad . Let us flip that equation . Let us work together to close those loopholes , end those incentives to ship jobs overseas , and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home . Moreover , we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads , upgrading our ports , unclogging our commutes because in today s global economy , first class jobs gravitate to first class infrastructure . We will need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer . But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects , so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible . We also have the chance , right now , to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high tech manufacturing jobs . My administration has launched two hubs for high tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown , where we have connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies . Tonight , I am announcing we will launch six more this year . Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create . So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work . Let us do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America . Over the past five years , my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other . And when ninety eight percent of our exporters are small businesses , new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia Pacific will help them create more jobs . We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers , protect our environment , and open new markets to new goods stamped Made in the USA . China and Europe are not standing on the sidelines . Neither should we . We know that the nation that goes all in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow . This is an edge America cannot surrender . Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones . That is why Congress should undo the damage done by last year s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery whether it is vaccines that stay ahead of drug resistant bacteria , or paper thin material that is stronger than steel . And let us pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation , not costly , needless litigation . Now , one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy . The all of the above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working , and today , America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades . One of the reasons why is natural gas if extracted safely , it is the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change . Businesses plan to invest almost 100 billion in new factories that use natural gas . I will cut red tape to help states get those factories built , and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas . My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air , our water , and our communities . And while we are at it , I will use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations . It is not just oil and natural gas production that is booming we are becoming a global leader in solar , too . Every four minutes , another American home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be outsourced . Let us continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving 4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that do not need it , so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do . And even as we have increased energy production , we have partnered with businesses , builders , and local communities to reduce the energy we consume . When we rescued our automakers , for example , we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars . In the coming months , I will build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks , so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump . Taken together , our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner , safer planet . Over the past eight years , the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth . But we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought , and coastal cities dealing with floods . That is why I directed my administration to work with states , utilities , and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air . The shift to a cleaner energy economy will not happen overnight , and it will require tough choices along the way . But the debate is settled . Climate change is a fact . And when our children s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer , more stable world , with new sources of energy , I want us to be able to sayyes , we did . Finally , if we are serious about economic growth , it is time to heed the call of business leaders , labor leaders , faith leaders , and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted . I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same . Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades . And for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreams to study , invent , and contribute to our culture they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone . So let us get immigration reform done this year . The ideas I have outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs . But in this rapidly changing economy , we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs . The good news is , we know how to do it . Two years ago , as the auto industry came roaring back , Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit . She knew that Ford needed parts for the best selling truck in America , and she knew how to make them . She just needed the workforce . So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job , or better job . She was flooded with new workers . And today , Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees . What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker . So tonight , I have asked Vice President Biden to lead an across the board reform of America s training programs to make sure they have one mission train Americans with the skills employers need , and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now . That means more on the job training , and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life . It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs . And if Congress wants to help , you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready to work Americans with ready to be filled jobs . I am also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it is more effective in today s economy . But first , this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1 . 6 million people . Let me tell you why . Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys . She had been steadily employed since she was a teenager . She put herself through college . She had never collected unemployment benefits . In May , she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home . A week later , budget cuts claimed the job she loved . Last month , when their unemployment insurance was cut off , she sat down and wrote me a letter the kind I get every day . We are the face of the unemployment crisis , she wrote . I am not dependent on the government hellip Our country depends on people like us who build careers , contribute to society hellip care about our neighbors hellip I am confident that in time I will find a job hellip I will pay my taxes , and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love . Please give us this chance . Congress , give these hardworking , responsible Americans that chance . They need our help , but more important , this country needs them in the game . That is why I have been asking CEOs to give more long term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week , many will come to the White House to make that commitment real . Tonight , I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same because we are stronger when America fields a full team . Of course , it is not enough to train today s workforce . We also have to prepare tomorrow s workforce , by guaranteeing every child access to a world class education . Estiven Rodriguez could not speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine . But last month , thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program , he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office , where they mailed off their college applications . And this son of a factory worker just found out he is going to college this fall . Five years ago , we set out to change the odds for all our kids . We worked with lenders to reform student loans , and today , more young people are earning college degrees than ever before . Race to the Top , with the help of governors from both parties , has helped states raise expectations and performance . Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington , are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy problem solving , critical thinking , science , technology , engineering , and math . Some of this change is hard . It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think , not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test . But it is worth it and it is working . The problem is we are still not reaching enough kids , and we are not reaching them in time . That has to change . Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child s life is high quality early education . Last year , I asked this Congress to help states make high quality pre K available to every four year old . As a parent as well as a President , I repeat that request tonight . But in the meantime , thirty states have raised pre k funding on their own . They know we cannot wait . So just as we worked with states to reform our schools , this year , we will invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children . And as Congress decides what it is going to do , I am going to pull together a coalition of elected officials , business leaders , and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high quality pre K they need . Last year , I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high speed broadband over the next four years . Tonight , I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple , Microsoft , Sprint , and Verizon , we have got a down payment to start connecting more than 15 , 000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years , without adding a dime to the deficit . We are working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real world education and hands on training that can lead directly to a job and career . We are shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information , and colleges more incentives to offer better value , so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college education . We are offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income , and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt . And I am reaching out to some of America s leading foundations and corporations ona new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential . The bottom line is , Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us . But we know our opportunity agenda will not be complete and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work , and hard work pays off for every single American . Today , women make up about half our workforce . But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns . That is wrong , and in 2014 , it is an embarrassment . A woman deserves equal pay for equal work . She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job . A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship and you know what , a father does , too . It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode . This year , let us all come together Congress , the White House , and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street to give every woman the opportunity she deserves . Because I firmly believe when women succeed , America succeeds . Now , women hold a majority of lower wage jobs but they are not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages . Americans understand that some people will earn more than others , and we do not resent those who , by virtue of their efforts , achieve incredible success . But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty . In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage , five states have passed laws to raise theirs . Many businesses have done it on their own . Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss , John Soranno . John s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis , and Nick helps make the dough . Only now he makes more of it John just gave his employees a raise , to ten bucks an hour a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale . Tonight , I ask more of America s business leaders to follow John s lead and do what you can to raise your employees wages . To every mayor , governor , and state legislator in America , I say , you do not have to wait for Congress to act Americans will support you if you take this on . And as a chief executive , I intend to lead by example . Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover . We should too . In the coming weeks , I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 . 10 an hour because if you cook our troops meals or wash their dishes , you should not have to live in poverty . Of course , to reach millions more , Congress needs to get on board . Today , the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here . Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 . 10 . This will help families . It will give businesses customers with more money to spend . It does not involve any new bureaucratic program . So join the rest of the country . Say yes . Give America a raise . There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet , and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit . Right now , it helps about half of all parents at some point . But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it does not do enough for single workers who do not have kids . So let us work together to strengthen the credit , reward work , and help more Americans get ahead . Let us do more to help Americans save for retirement . Today , most workers do not have a pension . A Social Security check often is not enough on its own . And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years , that does not help folks who do not have 401ks . That is why , tomorrow , I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings MyRIt is a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg . MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in . And if this Congress wants to help , work with me to fix an upside down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save , but does little to nothing for middle class Americans . Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job , so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can . And since the most important investment many families make is their home , send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again , and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans . One last point on financial security . For decades , few things exposed hard working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system . And in case you have not heard , we are in the process of fixing that . A pre existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley , a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona , could not get health insurance . But on January 1st , she got covered . On January 3rd , she felt a sharp pain . On January 6th , she had emergency surgery . Just one week earlier , Amanda said , that surgery would have meant bankruptcy . That is what health insurance reform is all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes , you do not have to lose everything . Already , because of the Affordable Care Act , more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents plans . More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage . And here s another number zero . Because of this law , no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma , back pain , or cancer . No woman can ever be charged more just because she is a woman . And we did all this while adding years to Medicare s finances , keeping Medicare premiums flat , and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors . Now , I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law . But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles . So again , if you have specific plans to cut costs , cover more people , and increase choice tell America what you had do differently . Let us see if the numbers add up . But let us not have another forty something votes to repeal a law that is already helping millions of Americans like Amanda . The first forty were plenty . We got it . We all owe it to the American people to say what we are for , not just what we are against . And if you want to know the real impact this law is having , just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky , who is here tonight . Kentucky s not the most liberal part of the country , but he is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth s families . They are our friends and neighbors , he said . They are people we shop and go to church with hellip farmers out on the tractors hellip grocery clerks hellip they are people who go to work every morning praying they do not get sick . No one deserves to live that way . Steve s right . That is why , tonight , I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st . Moms , get on your kids to sign up . Kids , call your mom and walk her through the application . It will give her some peace of mind plus , she will appreciate hearing from you . After all , that is the spirit that has always moved this nation forward . It is the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility , we can pursue our individual dreams , but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well . Citizenship means standing up for everyone s right to vote . Last year , part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened . But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote . Let us support these efforts . It should be the power of our vote , not the size of our bank account , that drives our democracy . Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day . I have seen the courage of parents , students , pastors , and police officers all over this country who say we are not afraid , and I intend to keep trying , with or without Congress , to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters , shopping malls , or schools like Sandy Hook . Citizenship demands a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self government an obligation to serve to our communities . And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces . Tonight , because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free , the United States is more secure . When I took office , nearly 180 , 000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , all our troops are out of Iraq . More than 60 , 000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan . With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security , our troops have moved to a support role . Together with our allies , we will complete our mission there by the end of this year , and America s longest war will finally be over . After 2014 , we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future . If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated , a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting Afghan forces , and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda . For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change , one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country . The fact is , that danger remains . While we have put al Qaeda s core leadership on a path to defeat , the threat has evolved , as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world . In Yemen , Somalia , Iraq , and Mali , we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks . In Syria , we will support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks . Here at home , we will keep strengthening our defenses , and combat new threats like cyberattacks . And as we reform our defense budget , we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform , and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions . We have to remain vigilant . But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone . As Commander in Chief , I have used force when needed to protect the American people , and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office . But I will not send our troops into harm s way unless it is truly necessary nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open ended conflicts . We must fight the battles that need to be fought , not those that terrorists prefer from us large scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism . So , even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners America must move off a permanent war footing . That is why I have imposed prudent limits on the use of drones for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence . That is why , working with this Congress , I will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence , here and abroad , that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated . And with the Afghan war ending , this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action , but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals , and setting an example for the rest of the world . You see , in a world of complex threats , our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power including strong and principled diplomacy . American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands , and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles . American diplomacy , backed by the threat of force , is why Syria s chemical weapons are being eliminated , and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship , terror and fear . As we speak , American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians , and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side . And it is American diplomacy , backed by pressure , that has halted the progress of Iran s nuclear program and rolled parts of that program back for the very first time in a decade . As we gather here tonight , Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium . It is not installing advanced centrifuges . Unprecedented inspections help the world verify , every day , that Iran is not building a bomb . And with our allies and partners , we are engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . These negotiations will be difficult . They may not succeed . We are clear eyed about Iran s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , which threaten our allies and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away . But these negotiations do not rely on trust any long term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb . If John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union , then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today . The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible . But let me be clear if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks , I will veto it . For the sake of our national security , we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed . If Iran s leaders do not seize this opportunity , then I will be the first to call for more sanctions , and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon . But if Iran s leaders do seize the chance , then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations , and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war . Finally , let us remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats , but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge greater cooperation , to expand new markets , to free people from fear and want . And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America . Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known . From Tunisia to Burma , we are supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy . In Ukraine , we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully , and have a say in their country s future . Across Africa , we are bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty . In the Americas , we are building new ties of commerce , but we are also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people . And we will continue to focus on the Asia Pacific , where we support our allies , shape a future of greater security and prosperity , and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster as we did in the Philippines , when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon , and were greeted with words like , We will never forget your kindness and God bless America We do these things because they help promote our long term security . And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being , regardless of race or religion , creed or sexual orientation . And next week , the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red , white , and blue into the Olympic Stadium and brings home the gold . My fellow Americans , no other country in the world does what we do . On every issue , the world turns to us , not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for , and the burdens we bear to advance them . No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform . As this time of war draws to a close , a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life . We will keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they have earned , and our wounded warriors receive the health care including the mental health care that they need . We will keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home . And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families . Let me tell you about one of those families I have come to know . I first met Cory Remsburg , a proud Army Ranger , at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D Day . Along with some of his fellow Rangers , he walked me through the program a strong , impressive young man , with an easy manner , sharp as a tack . We joked around , and took pictures , and I told him to stay in touch . A few months later , on his tenth deployment , Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan . His comrades found him in a canal , face down , underwater , shrapnel in his brain . For months , he lay in a coma . The next time I met him , in the hospital , he could not speak he could barely move . Over the years , he is endured dozens of surgeries and procedures , and hours of grueling rehab every day . Even now , Cory is still blind in one eye . He still struggles on his left side . But slowly , steadily , with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig , and the community around him , Cory has grown stronger . Day by day , he is learned to speak again and stand again and walk again and he is working toward the day when he can serve his country again . My recovery has not been easy , he says . Nothing in life that is worth anything is easy . Cory is here tonight . And like the Army he loves , like the America he serves , Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up , and he does not quit . My fellow Americans , men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy . Our freedom , our democracy , has never been easy . Sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged . But for more than two hundred years , we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice , and fairness , and equality under the law , so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen . The America we want for our kids a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us none of it is easy . But if we work together if we summon what is best in us , with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow I know it is within our reach . Believe it . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans We are 15 years into this new century . Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world . It has been , and still is , a hard time for many . But tonight , we turn the page . Tonight , after a breakthrough year for America , our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 . Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis . More of our kids are graduating than ever before . More of our people are insured than ever before . And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years . Tonight , for the first time since 9 11 , our combat mission in Afghanistan is over . Six years ago , nearly 180 , 000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , fewer than 15 , 000 remain . And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9 11 Generation who has served to keep us safe . We are humbled and grateful for your service . America , for all that we have endured for all the grit and hard work required to come back for all the tasks that lie ahead , know this The shadow of crisis has passed , and the State of the Union is strong . At this moment with a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , booming energy production we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth . It is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come . Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort Will we approach the world fearful and reactive , dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing Or will we lead wisely , using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward In two weeks , I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical , not partisan . And in the months ahead , I will crisscross the country making a case for those ideas . So tonight , I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals , and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us . It begins with our economy . Seven years ago , Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds . She waited tables . He worked construction . Their first child , Jack , was on the way . They were young and in love in America . And it does not get much better than that . If only we had known , Rebekah wrote to me last spring , what was about to happen to the housing and construction market . As the crisis worsened , Ben s business dried up , so he took what jobs he could find , even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time . Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college , and retrained for a new career . They sacrificed for each other . And slowly , it paid off . They bought their first home . They had a second son , Henry . Rebekah got a better job and then a raise . Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night . It is amazing , Rebekah wrote , what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong , tight knit family who has made it through some very , very hard times . We are a strong , tight knit family who has made it through some very , very hard times . America , Rebekah and Ben s story is our story . They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped , and sacrificed and retooled . You are the reason that I ran for this office . You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today , in the darkest months of the crisis , when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation . And it has been your resilience , your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger . We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores . And over the past five years , our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs . We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet . And today , America is number one in oil and gas . America is number one in wind power . Every three weeks , we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008 . And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards , the typical family this year should save about 750 at the pump . We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world . And today , our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record . Our high school graduation rate has hit an all time high . More Americans finish college than ever before . We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis , shield families from ruin , and encourage fair competition . Today , we have new tools to stop taxpayer funded bailouts , and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices . And in the past year alone , about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage . At every step , we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious that we would crush jobs and explode deficits . Instead , we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade , our deficits cut by two thirds , a stock market that has doubled , and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years . This is good news , people . So the verdict is clear . Middle class economics works . Expanding opportunity works . And these policies will continue to work as long as politics do not get in the way . We cannot slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns . We cannot put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance , or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street , or refighting past battles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system . And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things , I will veto it . It will have earned my veto . Today , thanks to a growing economy , the recovery is touching more and more lives . Wages are finally starting to rise again . We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007 . But here s the thing Those of us here tonight , we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government does not screw things up that government does not halt the progress we are making . We need to do more than just do no harm . Tonight , together , let us do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American . Because families like Rebekah s still need our help . She and Ben are working as hard as ever , but they have had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement . Friday night pizza , that is a big splurge . Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage , and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota . Like millions of hardworking Americans , Rebekah is not asking for a handout , but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead . And in fact , at every moment of economic change throughout our history , this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot . We set up worker protections , Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity . We gave our citizens schools and colleges , infrastructure and the Internet tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them . That is what middle class economics is the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot , everyone does their fair share , everyone plays by the same set of rules . We do not just want everyone to share in America s success , we want everyone to contribute to our success . So what does middle class economics require in our time First , middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change . That means helping folks afford childcare , college , health care , a home , retirement . And my budget will address each of these issues , lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year . Here s one example . During World War Iwhen men like my grandfather went off to war , having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority so this country provided universal childcare . In today s economy , when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families , we need affordable , high quality childcare more than ever . It is not a nice to have it is a must have . So it is time we stop treating childcare as a side issue , or as a women s issue , and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us . And that is why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low income family with young children in America by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to 3 , 000 per child , per year . Here s another example . Today , we are the only advanced country on Earth that does not guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers . Forty three million workers have no paid sick leave 43 million . Think about that . And that forces too many parents to make the gut wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home . So I will be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own . And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November , let us put it to a vote right here in Washington . Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave . It is the right thing to do . It is the right thing to do . Of course , nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages . That is why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work . It is 2015 . It is time . We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned . And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage , I say this If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than 15 , 000 a year , try it . If not , vote to give millions of the hardest working people in America a raise . Now , these ideas will not make everybody rich , will not relieve every hardship . That is not the job of government . To give working families a fair shot , we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company s long term interest . We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions , and give American workers a voice . But you know , things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families . That is a fact . And that is what all of us , Republicans and Democrats alike , were sent here to do . Second , to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road , we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills . America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free , sent a generation of GIs to college , trained the best workforce in the world . We were ahead of the curve . But other countries caught on . And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before , we need to up our game . We need to do more . By the end of this decade , two in three job openings will require some higher education two in three . And yet , we still live in a country where too many bright , striving Americans are priced out of the education they need . It is not fair to them , and it is sure not smart for our future . That is why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero . Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college . Some are young and starting out . Some are older and looking for a better job . Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market . Whoever you are , this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt . Understand , you have got to earn it . You have got to keep your grades up and graduate on time . Tennessee , a state with Republican leadership , and Chicago , a city with Democratic leadership , are showing that free community college is possible . I want to spread that idea all across America , so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today . Let us stay ahead of the curve . And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt does not derail anyone s dreams . Thanks to Vice President Biden s great work to update our job training system , we are connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high paying jobs like coding , and nursing , and robotics . Tonight , I am also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPand offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they do not have a higher education . And as a new generation of veterans comes home , we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend . Already , we have made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care . We are slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need . And we are making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs . And Joining Forces , the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden thank you , Michelle thank you , Jill has helped nearly 700 , 000 veterans and military spouses get a new job . So to every CEO in America , let me repeat If you want somebody who is going to get the job done and done right , hire a veteran . Finally , as we better train our workers , we need the new economy to keep churning out high wage jobs for our workers to fill . Since 2010 , America has put more people back to work than Europe , Japan , and all advanced economies combined . Our manufacturers have added almost 800 , 000 new jobs . Some of our bedrock sectors , like our auto industry , are booming . But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that did not even exist 10 or 20 years ago jobs at companies like Google , and eBay , and Tesla . So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future . But we do know we want them here in America . We know that . And that is why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere , the place where businesses want to locate and hire . Twenty first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure modern ports , and stronger bridges , faster trains and the fastest Internet . Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this . So let us set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline . Let us pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year , and make this country stronger for decades to come . Let us do it . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . Twenty first century businesses , including small businesses , need to sell more American products overseas . Today , our businesses export more than ever , and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages . But as we speak , China wants to write the rules for the world s fastest growing region . That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage . Why would we let that happen We should write those rules . We should level the playing field . That is why I am asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers , with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that are not just free , but are also fair . It is the right thing to do . Look , I am the first one to admit that past trade deals have not always lived up to the hype , and that is why we have gone after countries that break the rules at our expense . But 95 percent of the world s customers live outside our borders . We cannot close ourselves off from those opportunities . More than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from China . So let us give them one more reason to get it done . Twenty first century businesses will rely on American science and technology , research and development . I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine one that delivers the right treatment at the right time . In some patients with cystic fibrosis , this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable . So tonight , I am launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes , and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier . We can do this . I intend to protect a free and open Internet , extend its reach to every classroom , and every community and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world . I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs converting sunlight into liquid fuel creating revolutionary prosthetics , so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again . Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit , but to stay . Last month , we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars . And in two months , to prepare us for those missions , Scott Kelly will begin a year long stay in space . So good luck , Captain . Make sure to Instagram it . We are proud of you . Now , the truth is , when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research , I know there is bipartisan support in this chamber . Members of both parties have told me so . Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments . As Americans , we do not mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does , too . But for far too long , lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight . They have riddled it with giveaways that the super rich do not need , while denying a break to middle class families who do . This year , we have an opportunity to change that . Let us close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad , and reward those that invest here in America . Let us use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home . Let us simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement , instead of the number of accountants she can afford . And let us close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth . We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college . We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy , and we can achieve that together . We can achieve it together . Helping hardworking families make ends meet . Giving them the tools they need for good paying jobs in this new economy . Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness . This is where America needs to go . I believe it is where the American people want to go . It will make our economy stronger a year from now , 15 years from now , and deep into the century ahead . Of course , if there is one thing this new century has taught us , it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores . My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America . In doing so , the question is not whether America leads in the world , but how . When we make rash decisions , reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts , and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer , more prosperous world . That is what our enemies want us to do . I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership . We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition building when we do not let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents . That is exactly what we are doing right now . And around the globe , it is making a difference . First , we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris . We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks , and we reserve the right to act unilaterally , as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies . At the same time , we have learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years . Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan , we have trained their security forces , who have now taken the lead , and we have honored our troops sacrifice by supporting that country s first democratic transition . Instead of sending large ground forces overseas , we are partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America . In Iraq and Syria , American leadership including our military power is stopping ISIL s advance . Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East , we are leading a broad coalition , including Arab nations , to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group . We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort , and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism . Now , this effort will take time . It will require focus . But we will succeed . And tonight , I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIWe need that authority . Second , we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy . We are upholding the principle that bigger nations cannot bully the small by opposing Russian aggression , and supporting Ukraine s democracy , and reassuring our NATO allies . Last year , as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies , as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states , Mr . Putin s aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength . That is what I heard from some folks . Well , today , it is America that stands strong and united with our allies , while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters . That is how America leads not with bluster , but with persistent , steady resolve . In Cuba , we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date . When what you are doing does not work for 50 years , it is time to try something new . And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere . It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba . It stands up for democratic values , and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people . And this year , Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo . As His Holiness , Pope Francis , has said , diplomacy is the work of small steps . These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba . And after years in prison , we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs . Welcome home , Alan . We are glad you are here . Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran , where , for the first time in a decade , we have halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material . Between now and this spring , we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear armed Iran , secures America and our allies including Israel , while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict . There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed , and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran . But new sanctions passed by this Congress , at this moment in time , will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating America from its allies making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again . It does not make sense . And that is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress . The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort , and I intend to stay true to that wisdom . Third , we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century . No foreign nation , no hacker , should be able to shut down our networks , steal our trade secrets , or invade the privacy of American families , especially our kids . So we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats , just as we have done to combat terrorism . And tonight , I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks , combat identity theft , and protect our children s information . That should be a bipartisan effort . If we do not act , we will leave our nation and our economy vulnerable . If we do , we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe . In West Africa , our troops , our scientists , our doctors , our nurses , our health care workers are rolling back Ebola saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease . I could not be prouder of them , and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts . But the job is not yet done , and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics , invest in smart development , and eradicate extreme poverty . In the Asia Pacific , we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade , how they resolve maritime disputes , how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief . And no challenge no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change . 2014 was the planet s warmest year on record . Now , one year does not make a trend , but this does 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century . I have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists that we do not have enough information to act . Well , I am not a scientist , either . But you know what , I know a lot of really good scientists at NASand at NOAand at our major universities . And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate , and if we do not act forcefully , we will continue to see rising oceans , longer , hotter heat waves , dangerous droughts and floods , and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe . The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security . We should act like it . And that is why , over the past six years , we have done more than ever to combat climate change , from the way we produce energy to the way we use it . That is why we have set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history . And that is whyI will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts . I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action . In Beijing , we made a historic announcement The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution . And China committed , for the first time , to limiting their emissions . And because the world s two largest economies came together , other nations are now stepping up , and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got . And there is one last pillar of our leadership , and that is the example of our values . As Americans , we respect human dignity , even when we are threatened , which is why I have prohibited torture , and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained . It is why we speak out against the deplorable anti Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world . It is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims , the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace . That is why we defend free speech , and advocate for political prisoners , and condemn the persecution of women , or religious minorities , or people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender . We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do , but because ultimately they will make us safer . As Americans , we have a profound commitment to justice . So it makes no sense to spend 3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit . Since I have been President , we have worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half . Now it is time to finish the job . And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down . It is not who we are . It is time to close Gitmo . As Americans , we cherish our civil liberties , and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks . So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs , I have not . As promised , our intelligence agencies have worked hard , with the recommendations of privacy advocates , to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse . And next month , we will issue a report on how we are keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy . Looking to the future instead of the past . Making sure we match our power with diplomacy , and use force wisely . Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities . Leading always with the example of our values . That is what makes us exceptional . That is what keeps us strong . That is why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards our own . You know , just over a decade ago , I gave a speech in Boston where I said there was not a liberal America or a conservative America a black America or a white America but a United States of America . I said this because I had seen it in my own life , in a nation that gave someone like me a chance because I grew up in Hawaii , a melting pot of races and customs because I made Illinois my home a state of small towns , rich farmland , one of the world s great cities a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents , good people of every ethnicity and every faith , share certain bedrock values . Over the past six years , the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency has not delivered on this vision . How ironic , they say , that our politics seems more divided than ever . It is held up as proof not just of my own flaws of which there are many but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided , naive , that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it . I know how tempting such cynicism may be . But I still think the cynics are wrong . I still believe that we are one people . I still believe that together , we can do great things , even when the odds are long . I believe this because over and over in my six years in office , I have seen America at its best . I have seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California , and our newest officers at West Point , Annapolis , Colorado Springs , New London . I have mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown , in Boston , in West Texas , and West Virginia . I have watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains , from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid Atlantic seaboard . I have seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country , a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 Americans call home . So I know the good , and optimistic , and big hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brother s keeper and our sister s keeper . And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example . So the question for those of us here tonight is how we , all of us , can better reflect America s hopes . I have served in Congress with many of you . I know many of you well . There are a lot of good people here , on both sides of the aisle . And many of you have told me that this is not what you signed up for arguing past each other on cable shows , the constant fundraising , always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision . Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns . Imagine if we did something different . Understand , a better politics is not one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine . A better politics is one where we appeal to each other s basic decency instead of our basest fears . A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other where we talk issues and values , and principles and facts , rather than gotcha moments , or trivial gaffes , or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people s daily lives . A politics a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter , and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility , asking them to join in the great mission of building America . If we are going to have arguments , let us have arguments , but let us make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country . We still may not agree on a woman s right to choose , but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all time lows , and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs . Yes , passions still fly on immigration , but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student , and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child , and that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants . I have talked to Republicans and Democrats about that . That is something that we can share . We may go at it in campaign season , but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred that it is being denied to too many and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act , we can come together , Democrats and Republicans , to make voting easier for every single American . We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York . But surely we can understand a father who fears his son cannot walk home without being harassed . And surely we can understand the wife who will not rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift . And surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years , the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together , and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans , community leaders and law enforcement , to reform America s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us . That is a better politics . That is how we start rebuilding trust . That is how we move this country forward . That is what the American people want . And that is what they deserve . I have no more campaigns to run . My only agenda I know because I won both of them . My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol to do what I believe is best for America . If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight , I ask you to join me in the work at hand . If you disagree with parts of it , I hope you will at least work with me where you do agree . And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas , I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger . Because I want this chamber , I want this city to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings , we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides , to unite in common effort , to help our neighbors , whether down the street or on the other side of the world . I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood , your life matters , and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids . I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift , that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen man and woman , young and old , black and white , Latino , Asian , immigrant , Native American , gay , straight , Americans with mental illness or physical disability . Everybody matters . I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states that we are the United States of America . I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past six years It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong , tight knit family who is made it through some very , very hard times . My fellow Americans , we , too , are a strong , tight knit family . We , too , have made it through some hard times . Fifteen years into this new century , we have picked ourselves up , dusted ourselves off , and begun again the work of remaking America . We have laid a new foundation . A brighter future is ours to write . Let us begin this new chapter together and let us start the work right now . Thank you . God bless you . God bless this country we love . Thank you .Well , you know I love you back . It is a rare honor in this life to follow one of your heroes . And John Lewis is one of my heroes . Now , I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown Chapel , heroics were not on his mind . A day like this was not on his mind . Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were milling about . Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics of non violence the right way to protect yourself when attacked . A doctor described what tear gas does to the body , while marchers scribbled down instructions for contacting their loved ones . The air was thick with doubt , anticipation and fear . And they comforted themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sung No matter what may be the test , God will take care of you Lean , weary one , upon His breast , God will take care of you . And then , his knapsack stocked with an apple , a toothbrush , and a book on government all you need for a night behind bars John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to change America . President and Mrs . Bush , Governor Bentley , Mayor Evans , Sewell , Reverend Strong , members of Congress , elected officials , foot soldiers , friends , fellow Americans As John noted , there are places and moments in America where this nation s destiny has been decided . Many are sites of war Concord and Lexington , Appomattox , Gettysburg . Others are sites that symbolize the daring of America s character Independence Hall and Seneca Falls , Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral . Selma is such a place . In one afternoon 50 years ago , so much of our turbulent history the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow the death of four little girls in Birmingham and the dream of a Baptist preacher all that history met on this bridge . It was not a clash of armies , but a clash of wills a contest to determine the true meaning of America . And because of men and women like John Lewis , Joseph Lowery , Hosea Williams , Amelia Boynton , Diane Nash , Ralph Abernathy , Vivian , Andrew Young , Fred Shuttlesworth , Dr . Martin Luther King , Jr . , and so many others , the idea of a just America and a fair America , an inclusive America , and a generous America that idea ultimately triumphed . As is true across the landscape of American history , we cannot examine this moment in isolation . The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes . We gather here to celebrate them . We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod tear gas and the trampling hoof men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching towards justice . They did as Scripture instructed Rejoice in hope , be patient in tribulation , be constant in prayer . And in the days to come , they went back again and again . When the trumpet call sounded for more to join , the people came black and white , young and old , Christian and Jew , waving the American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and hope . A white newsman , Bill Plante , who covered the marches then and who is with us here today , quipped that the growing number of white people lowered the quality of the singing . To those who marched , though , those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweet . In time , their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson . And he would send them protection , and speak to the nation , echoing their call for America and the world to hear We shall overcome . What enormous faith these men and women had . Faith in God , but also faith in America . The Americans who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing . But they gave courage to millions . They held no elected office . But they led a nation . They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence , countless daily indignities but they did not seek special treatment , just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before . What they did here will reverberate through the ages . Not because the change they won was preordained not because their victory was complete but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible , that love and hope can conquer hate . As we commemorate their achievement , we are well served to remember that at the time of the marches , many in power condemned rather than praised them . Back then , they were called Communists , or half breeds , or outside agitators , sexual and moral degenerates , and worse they were called everything but the name their parents gave them . Their faith was questioned . Their lives were threatened . Their patriotism challenged . And yet , what could be more American than what happened in this place What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people unsung , the downtrodden , the dreamers not of high station , not born to wealth or privilege , not of one religious tradition but many , coming together to shape their country s course What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this , what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished , that we are strong enough to be self critical , that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals That is why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience . That is why it is not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance . It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents We the People hellip in order to form a more perfect union . We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal . These are not just words . They are a living thing , a call to action , a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny . For founders like Franklin and Jefferson , for leaders like Lincoln and FDthe success of our experiment in self government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work . And that is what we celebrate here in Selma . That is what this movement was all about , one leg in our long journey toward freedom . The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge , that is the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny . It is the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot , workers to organize against an unjust status quo the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon . It is the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths . It requires the occasional disruption , the willingness to speak out for what is right , to shake up the status quo . That is America . That is what makes us unique . That is what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity . Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall . Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid . Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule . They saw what John Lewis had done . From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine , this generation of young people can draw strength from this place , where the powerless could change the world s greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom . They saw that idea made real right here in Selma , Alabama . They saw that idea manifest itself here in America . Because of campaigns like this , a Voting Rights Act was passed . Political and economic and social barriers came down . And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms , who sit on the bench , who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office . Because of what they did , the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks , but for every American . Women marched through those doors . Latinos marched through those doors . Asian Americans , gay Americans , Americans with disabilities they all came through those doors . Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again , not by reasserting the past , but by transcending the past . What a glorious thing , Dr . King might say . And what a solemn debt we owe . Which leads us to ask , just how might we repay that debt First and foremost , we have to recognize that one day s commemoration , no matter how special , is not enough . If Selma taught us anything , it is that our work is never done . The American experiment in self government gives work and purpose to each generation . Selma teaches us , as well , that action requires that we shed our cynicism . For when it comes to the pursuit of justice , we can afford neither complacency nor despair . Just this week , I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justice s Ferguson report shows that , with respect to race , little has changed in this country . And I understood the question the report s narrative was sadly familiar . It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement . But I rejected the notion that nothing s changed . What happened in Ferguson may not be unique , but it is no longer endemic . It is no longer sanctioned by law or by custom . And before the Civil Rights Movement , it most surely was . We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable , that racial division is inherent to America . If you think nothing s changed in the past 50 years , ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s . Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing s changed . Ask your gay friend if it is easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago . To deny this progress , this hard won progress our progress would be to rob us of our own agency , our own capacity , our responsibility to do what we can to make America better . Of course , a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident that racism is banished that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete , and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the race card for their own purposes . We do not need the Ferguson report to know that is not true . We just need to open our eyes , and our ears , and our hearts to know that this nation s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us . We know the march is not yet over . We know the race is not yet won . We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged , all of us , by the content of our character requires admitting as much , facing up to the truth . We are capable of bearing a great burden , James Baldwin once wrote , once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is . There is nothing America cannot handle if we actually look squarely at the problem . And this is work for all Americans , not just some . Not just whites . Not just blacks . If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day , then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination . All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now . All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions , on our attitudes , the things we teach our children . And if we make such an effort , no matter how hard it may sometimes seem , laws can be passed , and consciences can be stirred , and consensus can be built . With such an effort , we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some . Together , we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect , and citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland , they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago the protection of the law . Together , we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons , and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men , and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads , and good workers , and good neighbors . With effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . Americans do not accept a free ride for anybody , nor do we believe in equality of outcomes . But we do expect equal opportunity . And if we really mean it , if we are not just giving lip service to it , but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it , then , yes , we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century , one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need . We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job , and a fair wage , and a real voice , and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle class . And with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge and that is the right to vote . Right now , in 2015 , 50 years after Selma , there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote . As we speak , more of such laws are being proposed . Meanwhile , the Voting Rights Act , the culmination of so much blood , so much sweat and tears , the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence , the Voting Rights Act stands weakened , its future subject to political rancor . How can that be The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy , the result of Republican and Democratic efforts . President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office . President George Bush signed its renewal when he was in office . One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it . If we want to honor this day , let that hundred go back to Washington and gather four hundred more , and together , pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year . That is how we honor those on this bridge . Of course , our democracy is not the task of Congress alone , or the courts alone , or even the President alone . If every new voter suppression law was struck down today , we would still have , here in America , one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples . Fifty years ago , registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar , the number of bubbles on a bar of soap . It meant risking your dignity , and sometimes , your life . What is our excuse today for not voting How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought How do we so fully give away our power , our voice , in shaping America s future Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places We give away our power . Fellow marchers , so much has changed in 50 years . We have endured war and we have fashioned peace . We have seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives . We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have scarcely imagined . But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship that willingness of a 26 year old deacon , or a Unitarian minister , or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that they had risk everything to realize its promise . That is what it means to love America . That is what it means to believe in America . That is what it means when we say America is exceptional . For we were born of change . We broke the old aristocracies , declaring ourselves entitled not by bloodline , but endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights . We secure our rights and responsibilities through a system of self government , of and by and for the people . That is why we argue and fight with so much passion and conviction because we know our efforts matter . We know America is what we make of it . Look at our history . We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea , pioneers who braved the unfamiliar , followed by a stampede of farmers and miners , and entrepreneurs and hucksters . That is our spirit . That is who we are . We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer , women who could do as much as any man and then some . And we are Susan Anthony , who shook the system until the law reflected that truth . That is our character . We are the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores , the huddled masses yearning to breathe free Holocaust survivors , Soviet defectors , the Lost Boys of Sudan . We are the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande because we want our kids to know a better life . That is how we came to be . We are the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South . We are the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up the West , and countless laborers who laid rail , and raised skyscrapers , and organized for workers rights . We are the fresh faced GIs who fought to liberate a continent . And we are the Tuskeegee Airmen , and the Navajo code talkers , and the Japanese Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied . We are the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on 9 11 , the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq . We are the gay Americans whose blood ran in the streets of San Francisco and New York , just as blood ran down this bridge . We are storytellers , writers , poets , artists who abhor unfairness , and despise hypocrisy , and give voice to the voiceless , and tell truths that need to be told . We are the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues , bluegrass and country , and hip hop and rock and roll , and our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom . We are Jackie Robinson , enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head , and stealing home in the World Series anyway . We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who build our temples for tomorrow , strong as we know how . We are the people Emerson wrote of , who for truth and honor s sake stand fast and suffer long who are never tired , so long as we can see far enough . That is what America is . Not stock photos or airbrushed history , or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others . We respect the past , but we do not pine for the past . We do not fear the future we grab for it . America is not some fragile thing . We are large , in the words of Whitman , containing multitudes . We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy , perpetually young in spirit . That is why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 could lead a mighty march . And that is what the young people here today and listening all across the country must take away from this day . You are America . Unconstrained by habit and convention . Unencumbered by what is , because you are ready to seize what ought to be . For everywhere in this country , there are first steps to be taken , there is new ground to cover , there are more bridges to be crossed . And it is you , the young and fearless at heart , the most diverse and educated generation in our history , who the nation is waiting to follow . Because Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person . Because the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word We . We The People . We Shall Overcome . Yes We Can . That word is owned by no one . It belongs to everyone . Oh , what a glorious task we are given , to continually try to improve this great nation of ours . Fifty years from Bloody Sunday , our march is not yet finished , but we are getting closer . Two hundred and thirty nine years after this nation s founding our union is not yet perfect , but we are getting closer . Our job s easier because somebody already got us through that first mile . Somebody already got us over that bridge . When it feels the road is too hard , when the torch we have been passed feels too heavy , we will remember these early travelers , and draw strength from their example , and hold firmly the words of the prophet Isaiah Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength . They will soar on wings like eagles . They will run and not grow weary . They will walk and not be faint . We honor those who walked so we could run . We must run so our children soar . And we will not grow weary . For we believe in the power of an awesome God , and we believe in this country s sacred promise . May He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us , and bless the United States of America . Thank you , everybody .Thank you . Muchas gracias . Thank you so much . Thank you very much . President Castro , the people of Cuba , thank you so much for the warm welcome that I have received , that my family have received , and that our delegation has received . It is an extraordinary honor to be here today . Before I begin , please indulge me . I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels . The thoughts and the prayers of the American people are with the people of Belgium . We stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people . We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally , Belgium , in bringing to justice those who are responsible . And this is yet another reminder that the world must unite , we must be together , regardless of nationality , or race , or faith , in fighting against the scourge of terrorism . We can and will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world . To the government and the people of Cuba , I want to thank you for the kindness that you have shown to me and Michelle , Malia , Sasha , my mother in law , Marian . Cultivo una rosa blanca . In his most famous poem , Jose Marti made this offering of friendship and peace to both his friend and his enemy . Today , as the President of the United States of America , I offer the Cuban people el saludo de paz . Havana is only 90 miles from Florida , but to get here we had to travel a great distance over barriers of history and ideology barriers of pain and separation . The blue waters beneath Air Force One once carried American battleships to this island to liberate , but also to exert control over Cuba . Those waters also carried generations of Cuban revolutionaries to the United States , where they built support for their cause . And that short distance has been crossed by hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles on planes and makeshift rafts who came to America in pursuit of freedom and opportunity , sometimes leaving behind everything they owned and every person that they loved . Like so many people in both of our countries , my lifetime has spanned a time of isolation between us . The Cuban Revolution took place the same year that my father came to the United States from Kenya . The Bay of Pigs took place the year that I was born . The next year , the entire world held its breath , watching our two countries , as humanity came as close as we ever have to the horror of nuclear war . As the decades rolled by , our governments settled into a seemingly endless confrontation , fighting battles through proxies . In a world that remade itself time and again , one constant was the conflict between the United States and Cuba . I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas . I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people . I want to be clear The differences between our governments over these many years are real and they are important . I am sure President Castro would say the same thing I know , because I have heard him address those differences at length . But before I discuss those issues , we also need to recognize how much we share . Because in many ways , the United States and Cuba are like two brothers who have been estranged for many years , even as we share the same blood . We both live in a new world , colonized by Europeans . Cuba , like the United States , was built in part by slaves brought here from Africa . Like the United States , the Cuban people can trace their heritage to both slaves and slave owners . We have welcomed both immigrants who came a great distance to start new lives in the Americas . Over the years , our cultures have blended together . Dr . Carlos Finlay s work in Cuba paved the way for generations of doctors , including Walter Reed , who drew on Dr . Finlay s work to help combat Yellow Fever . Just as Marti wrote some of his most famous words in New York , Ernest Hemingway made a home in Cuba , and found inspiration in the waters of these shores . We share a national past time La Pelota and later today our players will compete on the same Havana field that Jackie Robinson played on before he made his Major League debut . And it is said that our greatest boxer , Muhammad Ali , once paid tribute to a Cuban that he could never fight saying that he would only be able to reach a draw with the great Cuban , Teofilo Stevenson . So even as our governments became adversaries , our people continued to share these common passions , particularly as so many Cubans came to America . In Miami or Havana , you can find places to dance the Cha Cha Cha or the Salsa , and eat ropa vieja . People in both of our countries have sung along with Celia Cruz or Gloria Estefan , and now listen to reggaeton or Pitbull . Millions of our people share a common religion a faith that I paid tribute to at the Shrine of our Lady of Charity in Miami , a peace that Cubans find in La Cachita . For all of our differences , the Cuban and American people share common values in their own lives . A sense of patriotism and a sense of pride a lot of pride . A profound love of family . A passion for our children , a commitment to their education . And that is why I believe our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration , as just one chapter in a longer story of family and of friendship . But we cannot , and should not , ignore the very real differences that we have about how we organize our governments , our economies , and our societies . Cuba has a one party system the United States is a multi party democracy . Cuba has a socialist economic model the United States is an open market . Cuba has emphasized the role and rights of the state the United States is founded upon the rights of the individual . Despite these differences , on December 17th 2014 , President Castro and I announced that the United States and Cuba would begin a process to normalize relations between our countries . Since then , we have established diplomatic relations and opened embassies . We have begun initiatives to cooperate on health and agriculture , education and law enforcement . We have reached agreements to restore direct flights and mail service . We have expanded commercial ties , and increased the capacity of Americans to travel and do business in Cuba . And these changes have been welcomed , even though there are still opponents to these policies . But still , many people on both sides of this debate have asked Why now Why now There is one simple answer What the United States was doing was not working . We have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth . A policy of isolation designed for the Cold War made little sense in the 21st century . The embargo was only hurting the Cuban people instead of helping them . And I have always believed in what Martin Luther King , Jr . called the fierce urgency of now we should not fear change , we should embrace it . That leads me to a bigger and more important reason for these changes Creo en el pueblo Cubano . I believe in the Cuban people . This is not just a policy of normalizing relations with the Cuban government . The United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people . And today , I want to share with you my vision of what our future can be . I want the Cuban people especially the young people to understand why I believe that you should look to the future with hope not the false promise which insists that things are better than they really are , or the blind optimism that says all your problems can go away tomorrow . Hope that is rooted in the future that you can choose and that you can shape , and that you can build for your country . I am hopeful because I believe that the Cuban people are as innovative as any people in the world . In a global economy , powered by ideas and information , a country s greatest asset is its people . In the United States , we have a clear monument to what the Cuban people can build it is called Miami . Here in Havana , we see that same talent in cuentapropistas , cooperatives and old cars that still run . El Cubano inventa del aire . Cuba has an extraordinary resource a system of education which values every boy and every girl . And in recent years , the Cuban government has begun to open up to the world , and to open up more space for that talent to thrive . In just a few years , we have seen how cuentapropistas can succeed while sustaining a distinctly Cuban spirit . Being self employed is not about becoming more like America , it is about being yourself . Look at Sandra Lidice Aldama , who chose to start a small business . Cubans , she said , can innovate and adapt without losing our identity hellip our secret is in not copying or imitating but simply being ourselves . Look at Papito Valladeres , a barber , whose success allowed him to improve conditions in his neighborhood . I realize I am not going to solve all of the world s problems , he said . But if I can solve problems in the little piece of the world where I live , it can ripple across Havana . That is where hope begins with the ability to earn your own living , and to build something you can be proud of . That is why our policies focus on supporting Cubans , instead of hurting them . That is why we got rid of limits on remittances so ordinary Cubans have more resources . That is why we are encouraging travel which will build bridges between our people , and bring more revenue to those Cuban small businesses . That is why we have opened up space for commerce and exchanges so that Americans and Cubans can work together to find cures for diseases , and create jobs , and open the door to more opportunity for the Cuban people . As President of the United States , I have called on our Congress to lift the embargo . It is an outdated burden on the Cuban people . It is a burden on the Americans who want to work and do business or invest here in Cuba . It is time to lift the embargo . But even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow , Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba . It should be easier to open a business here in Cuba . A worker should be able to get a job directly with companies who invest here in Cuba . Two currencies should not separate the type of salaries that Cubans can earn . The Internet should be available across the island , so that Cubans can connect to the wider world and to one of the greatest engines of growth in human history . There is no limitation from the United States on the ability of Cuba to take these steps . It is up to you . And I can tell you as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the 21st century depends upon education , health care , and environmental protection . But it also depends on the free and open exchange of ideas . If you cannot access information online , if you cannot be exposed to different points of view , you will not reach your full potential . And over time , the youth will lose hope . I know these issues are sensitive , especially coming from an American President . Before 1959 , some Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit , ignored poverty , enabled corruption . And since 1959 , we have been shadow boxers in this battle of geopolitics and personalities . I know the history , but I refuse to be trapped by it . I have made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity , nor the intention to impose change on Cuba . What changes come will depend upon the Cuban people . We will not impose our political or economic system on you . We recognize that every country , every people , must chart its own course and shape its own model . But having removed the shadow of history from our relationship , I must speak honestly about the things that I believe the things that we , as Americans , believe . As Marti said , Liberty is the right of every man to be honest , to think and to speak without hypocrisy . So let me tell you what I believe . I cannot force you to agree , but you should know what I think . I believe that every person should be equal under the law . Every child deserves the dignity that comes with education , and health care and food on the table and a roof over their heads . I believe citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear to organize , and to criticize their government , and to protest peacefully , and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detentions of people who exercise those rights . I believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly . And , yes , I believe voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections . Not everybody agrees with me on this . Not everybody agrees with the American people on this . But I believe those human rights are universal . I believe they are the rights of the American people , the Cuban people , and people around the world . Now , there is no secret that our governments disagree on many of these issues . I have had frank conversations with President Castro . For many years , he has pointed out the flaws in the American system economic inequality the death penalty racial discrimination wars abroad . That is just a sample . He has a much longer list . But here s what the Cuban people need to understand I welcome this open debate and dialogue . It is good . It is healthy . I am not afraid of it . We do have too much money in American politics . But , in America , it is still possible for somebody like me a child who was raised by a single mom , a child of mixed race who did not have a lot of money to pursue and achieve the highest office in the land . That is what is possible in America . We do have challenges with racial bias in our communities , in our criminal justice system , in our society the legacy of slavery and segregation . But the fact that we have open debates within America s own democracy is what allows us to get better . In 1959 , the year that my father moved to America , it was illegal for him to marry my mother , who was white , in many American states . When I first started school , we were still struggling to desegregate schools across the American South . But people organized they protested they debated these issues they challenged government officials . And because of those protests , and because of those debates , and because of popular mobilization , I am able to stand here today as an African American and as President of the United States . That was because of the freedoms that were afforded in the United States that we were able to bring about change . I am not saying this is easy . There is still enormous problems in our society . But democracy is the way that we solve them . That is how we got health care for more of our people . That is how we made enormous gains in women s rights and gay rights . That is how we address the inequality that concentrates so much wealth at the top of our society . Because workers can organize and ordinary people have a voice , American democracy has given our people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and enjoy a high standard of living . Now , there are still some tough fights . It is not always pretty , the process of democracy . It is often frustrating . You can see that in the election going on back home . But just stop and consider this fact about the American campaign that is taking place right now . You had two Cuban Americans in the Republican Party , running against the legacy of a black man who is President , while arguing that they are the best person to beat the Democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a Democratic Socialist . Who would have believed that back in 1959 That is a measure of our progress as a democracy . So here s my message to the Cuban government and the Cuban people The ideals that are the starting point for every revolution America s revolution , Cuba s revolution , the liberation movements around the world those ideals find their truest expression , I believe , in democracy . Not because American democracy is perfect , but precisely because we are not . And we like every country need the space that democracy gives us to change . It gives individuals the capacity to be catalysts to think in new ways , and to reimagine how our society should be , and to make them better . There is already an evolution taking place inside of Cuba , a generational change . Many suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down but I am appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up , build something new . El futurode Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo Cubano . And to President Castro who I appreciate being here today I want you to know , I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States . And given your commitment to Cuba s sovereignty and self determination , I am also confident that you need not fear the different voices of the Cuban people and their capacity to speak , and assemble , and vote for their leaders . In fact , I am hopeful for the future because I trust that the Cuban people will make the right decisions . And as you do , I am also confident that Cuba can continue to play an important role in the hemisphere and around the globe and my hope is , is that you can do so as a partner with the United States . We have played very different roles in the world . But no one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and suffering . Last year , American health care workers and the military worked side by side with Cubans to save lives and stamp out Ebola in West Africa . I believe that we should continue that kind of cooperation in other countries . We have been on the different side of so many conflicts in the Americas . But today , Americans and Cubans are sitting together at the negotiating table , and we are helping the Colombian people resolve a civil war that is dragged on for decades . That kind of cooperation is good for everybody . It gives everyone in this hemisphere hope . We took different journeys to our support for the people of South Africa in ending apartheid . But President Castro and I could both be there in Johannesburg to pay tribute to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela . And in examining his life and his words , I am sure we both realize we have more work to do to promote equality in our own countries to reduce discrimination based on race in our own countries . And in Cuba , we want our engagement to help lift up the Cubans who are of African descent who have proven that there is nothing they cannot achieve when given the chance . We have been a part of different blocs of nations in the hemisphere , and we will continue to have profound differences about how to promote peace , security , opportunity , and human rights . But as we normalize our relations , I believe it can help foster a greater sense of unity in the Americas todos somos Americanos . From the beginning of my time in office , I have urged the people of the Americas to leave behind the ideological battles of the past . We are in a new era . I know that many of the issues that I have talked about lack the drama of the past . And I know that part of Cuba s identity is its pride in being a small island nation that could stand up for its rights , and shake the world . But I also know that Cuba will always stand out because of the talent , hard work , and pride of the Cuban people . That is your strength . Cuba does not have to be defined by being against the United States , any more than the United States should be defined by being against Cuba . I am hopeful for the future because of the reconciliation that is taking place among the Cuban people . I know that for some Cubans on the island , there may be a sense that those who left somehow supported the old order in Cuba . I am sure there is a narrative that lingers here which suggests that Cuban exiles ignored the problems of pre Revolutionary Cuba , and rejected the struggle to build a new future . But I can tell you today that so many Cuban exiles carry a memory of painful and sometimes violent separation . They love Cuba . A part of them still considers this their true home . That is why their passion is so strong . That is why their heartache is so great . And for the Cuban American community that I have come to know and respect , this is not just about politics . This is about family the memory of a home that was lost the desire to rebuild a broken bond the hope for a better future the hope for return and reconciliation . For all of the politics , people are people , and Cubans are Cubans . And I have come here I have traveled this distance on a bridge that was built by Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits . I first got to know the talent and passion of the Cuban people in America . And I know how they have suffered more than the pain of exile they also know what it is like to be an outsider , and to struggle , and to work harder to make sure their children can reach higher in America . So the reconciliation of the Cuban people the children and grandchildren of revolution , and the children and grandchildren of exile that is fundamental to Cuba s future . You see it in Gloria Gonzalez , who traveled here in 2013 for the first time after 61 years of separation , and was met by her sister , Llorca . You recognized me , but I did not recognize you , Gloria said after she embraced her sibling . Imagine that , after 61 years . You see it in Melinda Lopez , who came to her family s old home . And as she was walking the streets , an elderly woman recognized her as her mother s daughter , and began to cry . She took her into her home and showed her a pile of photos that included Melinda s baby picture , which her mother had sent 50 years ago . Melinda later said , So many of us are now getting so much back . You see it in Cristian Miguel Soler , a young man who became the first of his family to travel here after 50 years . And meeting relatives for the first time , he said , I realized that family is family no matter the distance between us . Sometimes the most important changes start in small places . The tides of history can leave people in conflict and exile and poverty . It takes time for those circumstances to change . But the recognition of a common humanity , the reconciliation of people bound by blood and a belief in one another that is where progress begins . Understanding , and listening , and forgiveness . And if the Cuban people face the future together , it will be more likely that the young people of today will be able to live with dignity and achieve their dreams right here in Cuba . The history of the United States and Cuba encompass revolution and conflict struggle and sacrifice retribution and , now , reconciliation . It is time , now , for us to leave the past behind . It is time for us to look forward to the future together un future de esperanza . And it will not be easy , and there will be setbacks . It will take time . But my time here in Cuba renews my hope and my confidence in what the Cuban people will do . We can make this journey as friends , and as neighbors , and as family together . Si se puede . Muchas gracias .Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans Tonight marks the eighth year that I have come here to report on the State of the Union . And for this final one , I am going to try to make it a little shorter . I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa . I have been there . I will be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips . And I understand that because it is an election season , expectations for what we will achieve this year are low . But , Mr . Speaker , I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families . So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse . So , who knows , we might surprise the cynics again . But tonight , I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead . Do not worry , I have got plenty , from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients . And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done . Fixing a broken immigration system . Protecting our kids from gun violence . Equal pay for equal work . Paid leave . Raising the minimum wage . All these things still matter to hardworking families . They are still the right thing to do . And I will not let up until they get done . But for my final address to this chamber , I do not want to just talk about next year . I want to focus on the next five years , the next 10 years , and beyond . I want to focus on our future . We live in a time of extraordinary change change that is reshaping the way we live , the way we work , our planet , our place in the world . It is change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs , but also economic disruptions that strain working families . It promises education for girls in the most remote villages , but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away . It is change that can broaden opportunity , or widen inequality . And whether we like it or not , the pace of this change will only accelerate . America has been through big changes before wars and depression , the influx of new immigrants , workers fighting for a fair deal , movements to expand civil rights . Each time , there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control . And each time , we overcame those fears . We did not , in the words of Lincoln , adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past . Instead we thought anew , and acted anew . We made change work for us , always extending America s promise outward , to the next frontier , to more people . And because we did because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril we emerged stronger and better than before . What was true then can be true now . Our unique strengths as a nation our optimism and work ethic , our spirit of discovery , our diversity , our commitment to rule of law these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come . In fact , it is that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible . It is how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations . It is how we reformed our health care system , and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans , and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love . But such progress is not inevitable . It is the result of choices we make together . And we face such choices right now . Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear , turning inward as a nation , turning against each other as a people Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are , in what we stand for , in the incredible things that we can do together So let us talk about the future , and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next President is , or who controls the next Congress . First , how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy Second , how do we make technology work for us , and not against us especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change Third , how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman And finally , how can we make our politics reflect what is best in us , and not what is worst Let me start with the economy , and a basic fact The United States of America , right now , has the strongest , most durable economy in the world . We are in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history . More than 14 million new jobs , the strongest two years of job growth since the 90s , an unemployment rate cut in half . Our auto industry just had its best year ever . That is just part of a manufacturing surge that is created nearly 900 , 000 new jobs in the past six years . And we have done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three quarters . Anyone claiming that America s economy is in decline is peddling fiction . Now , what is true and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious is that the economy has been changing in profound ways , changes that started long before the Great Recession hit changes that have not let up . Today , technology does not just replace jobs on the assembly line , but any job where work can be automated . Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere , and they face tougher competition . As a result , workers have less leverage for a raise . Companies have less loyalty to their communities . And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top . All these trends have squeezed workers , even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing . It is made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty , harder for young people to start their careers , tougher for workers to retire when they want to . And although none of these trends are unique to America , they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot . For the past seven years , our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody . We have made progress . But we need to make more . And despite all the political arguments that we have had these past few years , there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree . We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good paying job . The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start , and together , we have increased early childhood education , lifted high school graduation rates to new highs , boosted graduates in fields like engineering . In the coming years , we should build on that progress , by providing Pre K for all and offering every student the hands on computer science and math classes that make them job ready on day one . We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids . And we have to make college affordable for every American . No hardworking student should be stuck in the red . We have already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower s income . And that is good . But now , we have actually got to cut the cost of college . Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that , and I am going to keep fighting to get that started this year . It is the right thing to do . But a great education is not all we need in this new economy . We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security . It is not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job , in the same place , with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber . For everyone else , especially folks in their 40s and 50s , saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher . Americans understand that at some point in their careers , in this new economy , they may have to retool and they may have to retrain . But they should not lose what they have already worked so hard to build in the process . That is why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever . We should not weaken them we should strengthen them . And for Americans short of retirement , basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today . That , by the way , is what the Affordable Care Act is all about . It is about filling the gaps in employer based care so that when you lose a job , or you go back to school , or you strike out and launch that new business , you will still have coverage . Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far . And in the process , health care inflation has slowed . And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law . Now , I am guessing we will not agree on health care anytime soon . A little applause right there . Just a guess . But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security . Say a hardworking American loses his job we should not just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that is ready to hire him . If that new job does not pay as much , there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills . And even if he is going from job to job , he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him . That is the way we make the new economy work better for everybody . I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty . America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance , a hand up . And I had welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support , like expanding tax cuts for low income workers who do not have children . But there are some areas where we just have to be honest it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years . And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations . And it is an honest disagreement , and the American people have a choice to make . I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy . I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed . There is red tape that needs to be cut . There you go Yes But after years now of record corporate profits , working families will not get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else s expense . Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered . Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on Wall Street did . Immigrants are not the principal reason wages have not gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long term returns . It is sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts . The point is , I believe that in this new economy , workers and start ups and small businesses need more of a voice , not less . The rules should work for them . And I am not alone in this . This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders . And I want to spread those best practices across America . That is part of a brighter future . In fact , it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative . And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges Sixty years ago , when the Russians beat us into space , we did not deny Sputnik was up there . We did not argue about the science , or shrink our research and development budget . We built a space program almost overnight . And 12 years later , we were walking on the moon . Now , that spirit of discovery is in our DNAmerica is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver . America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride . America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley , racing to shape a better world . That is who we are . And over the past seven years , we have nurtured that spirit . We have protected an open Internet , and taken bold new steps to get more students and low income Americans online . We have launched next generation manufacturing hubs , and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day . But we can do so much more . Last year , Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot , America can cure cancer . Last month , he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they have had in over a decade . So tonight , I am announcing a new national effort to get it done . And because he is gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years , I am putting Joe in charge of Mission Control . For the loved ones we have all lost , for the families that we can still save , let us make America the country that cures cancer once and for all . Medical research is critical . We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources . Look , if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change , have at it . You will be pretty lonely , because you will be debating our military , most of America s business leaders , the majority of the American people , almost the entire scientific community , and 200 nations around the world who agree it is a problem and intend to solve it . But even if even if the planet was not at stake , even if 2014 was not the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future Listen , seven years ago , we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history . Here are the results . In fields from Iowa to Texas , wind power is now cheaper than dirtier , conventional power . On rooftops from Arizona to New York , solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills , and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average . We are taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy something , by the way , that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support . And meanwhile , we have cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent , and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth . Gas under two bucks a gallon am not bad , either . Now we have got to accelerate the transition away from old , dirtier energy sources . Rather than subsidize the past , we should invest in the future especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels . We do them no favor when we do not show them where the trends are going . That is why I am going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources , so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet . And that way , we put money back into those communities , and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system . Now , none of this is going to happen overnight . And , yes , there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo . But the jobs we will create , the money we will save , the planet we will preserve that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve . And it is within our grasp . Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world . And that is why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation build everywhere there is a problem . I told you earlier all the talk of America s economic decline is political hot air . Well , so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker . Let me tell you something . The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth . Period . Period . It is not even close . It is not even close . It is not even close . We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined . Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world . No nation attacks us directly , or our allies , because they know that is the path to ruin . Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office , and when it comes to every important international issue , people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead they call us . I mean , it is useful to level the set here , because when we do not , we do not make good decisions . Now , as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing , I know this is a dangerous time . But that is not primarily because of some looming superpower out there , and certainly not because of diminished American strength . In today s world , we are threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states . The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation , rooted in conflicts that date back millennia . Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition . Even as their economy severely contracts , Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit . And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality . It is up to us , the United States of America , to help remake that system . And to do that well it means that we have got to set priorities . Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks . Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people , because in today s world , even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life , including their own , can do a lot of damage . They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country . Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies . We have to take them out . But as we focus on destroying ISIover the top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands . Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks , twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped . But they do not threaten our national existence . That is the story ISIL wants to tell . That is the kind of propaganda they use to recruit . We do not need to build them up to show that we are serious , and we sure do not need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world s largest religions . We just need to call them what they are killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out , hunted down , and destroyed . And that is exactly what we are doing . For more than a year , America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL s financing , disrupt their plots , stop the flow of terrorist fighters , and stamp out their vicious ideology . With nearly 10 , 000 air strikes , we are taking out their leadership , their oil , their training camps , their weapons . We are training , arming , and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria . If this Congress is serious about winning this war , and wants to send a message to our troops and the world , authorize the use of military force against ISITake a vote . Take a vote . But the American people should know that with or without congressional action , ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them . If you doubt America s commitment or mine to see that justice is done , just ask Osama bin Laden . Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen , who was taken out last year , or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks , who sits in a prison cell . When you come after Americans , we go after you . And it may take time , but we have long memories , and our reach has no limits . Our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda , but it cannot stop there . For even without ISIeven without al Qaeda , instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world in the Middle East , in Afghanistan , parts of Pakistan , in parts of Central America , in Africa , and Asia . Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks . Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict , or famine , feeding the next wave of refugees . The world will look to us to help solve these problems , and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians . That may work as a TV sound bite , but it does not pass muster on the world stage . We also cannot try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis , even if it is done with the best of intentions . That is not leadership that is a recipe for quagmire , spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us . It is the lesson of Vietnam it is the lesson of Iraq and we should have learned it by now . Fortunately , there is a smarter approach , a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power . It says America will always act , alone if necessary , to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern , we will mobilize the world to work with us , and make sure other countries pull their own weight . That is our approach to conflicts like Syria , where we are partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace . That is why we built a global coalition , with sanctions and principled diplomacy , to prevent a nuclear armed Iran . And as we speak , Iran has rolled back its nuclear program , shipped out its uranium stockpile , and the world has avoided another war . That is how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa . Our military , our doctors , our development workers they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic . Hundreds of thousands , maybe a couple million lives were saved . That is how we forged a Trans Pacific Partnership to open markets , and protect workers and the environment , and advance American leadership in Asia . It cuts 18 , 000 taxes on products made in America , which will then support more good jobs here in America . With TPChina does not set the rules in that region we do . You want to show our strength in this new century Approve this agreement . Give us the tools to enforce it . It is the right thing to do . Let me give you another example . Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy , and set us back in Latin America . That is why we restored diplomatic relations opened the door to travel and commerce , positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people . So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere , recognize that the Cold War is over lift the embargo . The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world except when we kill terrorists or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling . Leadership means a wise application of military power , and rallying the world behind causes that are right . It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security , not something separate , not charity . When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change , yes , that helps vulnerable countries , but it also protects our kids . When we help Ukraine defend its democracy , or Colombia resolve a decades long war , that strengthens the international order we depend on . When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick it is the right thing to do , and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores . Right now , we are on track to end the scourge of HIV AIDThat is within our grasp . And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something I will be pushing this Congress to fund this year . That is American strength . That is American leadership . And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example . That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo . It is expensive , it is unnecessary , and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies . There is a better way . And that is why we need to reject any politics any politics that targets people because of race or religion . Let me just say this . This is not a matter of political correctness . This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong . The world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity , and our openness , and the way we respect every faith . His Holiness , Pope Francis , told this body from the very spot that I am standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place . When politicians insult Muslims , whether abroad or our fellow citizens , when a mosque is vandalized , or a kid is called names , that does not make us safer . That is not telling it like it is . It is just wrong . It diminishes us in the eyes of the world . It makes it harder to achieve our goals . It betrays who we are as a country . We the People . Our Constitution begins with those three simple words , words we have come to recognize mean all the people , not just some words that insist we rise and fall together , and that is how we might perfect our Union . And that brings me to the fourth , and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight . The future we want all of us want opportunity and security for our families , a rising standard of living , a sustainable , peaceful planet for our kids all that is within our reach . But it will only happen if we work together . It will only happen if we can have rational , constructive debates . It will only happen if we fix our politics . A better politics does not mean we have to agree on everything . This is a big country different regions , different attitudes , different interests . That is one of our strengths , too . Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government , and expected us to argue , just as they did , fiercely , over the size and shape of government , over commerce and foreign relations , over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security . But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens . It does not work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice . It does not work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America . Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise , or when even basic facts are contested , or when we listen only to those who agree with us . Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention . And most of all , democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice does not matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest . Too many Americans feel that way right now . It is one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better . I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide , and I guarantee I will keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office . But , my fellow Americans , this cannot be my task or any President s alone . There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber , good people who would like to see more cooperation , would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington , but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected , by the noise coming out of your base . I know you have told me . It is the worst kept secret in Washington . And a lot of you are not enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor . But that means if we want a better politics and I am addressing the American people now if we want a better politics , it is not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President . We have to change the system to reflect our better selves . I think we have got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters , and not the other way around . Let a bipartisan group do it . We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics , so that a handful of families or hidden interests cannot bankroll our elections . And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cannot pass muster in the courts , we need to work together to find a real solution because it is a problem . And most of you do not like raising money . I know I have done it . We have got to make it easier to vote , not harder . We need to modernize it for the way we live now . This is America We want to make it easier for people to participate . And over the course of this year , I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that . But I cannot do these things on my own . Changes in our political process in not just who gets elected , but how they get elected that will only happen when the American people demand it . It depends on you . That is what is meant by a government of , by , and for the people . What I am suggesting is hard . It is a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible , and politics is hopeless , and the problem is all the folks who are elected do not care , and to believe that our voices and actions do not matter . But if we give up now , then we forsake a better future . Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war , or allow another economic disaster , or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought , even died , to secure . And then , as frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who do not look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background . We cannot afford to go down that path . It will not deliver the economy we want . It will not produce the security we want . But most of all , it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world . So , my fellow Americans , whatever you may believe , whether you prefer one party or no party , whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen . To vote . To speak out . To stand up for others , especially the weak , especially the vulnerable , knowing that each of us is only here because somebody , somewhere , stood up for us . We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day . It is not easy . Our brand of democracy is hard . But I can promise that a little over a year from now , when I no longer hold this office , I will be right there with you as a citizen , inspired by those voices of fairness and vision , of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far . Voices that help us see ourselves not , first and foremost , as black or white , or Asian or Latino , not as gay or straight , immigrant or native born , not as Democrat or Republican , but as Americans first , bound by a common creed . Voices Dr . King believed would have the final word voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love . And they are out there , those voices . They do not get a lot of attention they do not seek a lot of fanfare but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing . I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours . I see you , the American people . And in your daily acts of citizenship , I see our future unfolding . I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open , and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off . I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project , and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease . I see it in the American who served his time , and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance . The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat , treating everybody with respect , doing the brave , quiet work of keeping us safe . I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers , the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon , the community that lines up to cheer him on . It is the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is , and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he is been taught . I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth . That is the America I know . That is the country we love . Clear eyed . Big hearted . Undaunted by challenge . Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word . That is what makes me so hopeful about our future . I believe in change because I believe in you , the American people . And that is why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong . Thank you , God bless you . God bless the United States of America .Hello Rutgers R U rah rah Thank you so much . Thank you . Everybody , please have a seat . Thank you , President Barchi , for that introduction . Let me congratulate my extraordinarily worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights , Dr . Burnell and Bill Moyers . Matthew , good job . If you are interested , we can talk after this . One of the perks of my job is honorary degrees . But I have to tell you , it impresses nobody in my house . Now Malia and Sasha just say , Okay , Dr . Dad , we will see you later . Can we have some money To the Board of Governors to Chairman Brown to Lieutenant Governor Guadagno Mayor Cahill Mayor Wahler , members of Congress , Rutgers administrators , faculty , staff , friends , and family thank you for the honor of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution . But most of all , congratulations to the Class of 2016 I come here for a simple reason to finally settle this pork roll vs . Taylor ham question . I am just kidding . There is not much I am afraid to take on in my final year of office , but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate . The truth is , Rutgers , I came here because you asked . Now , it is true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year . But you are the first to launch a three year campaign . Emails , letters , tweets , YouTube videos . I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president . And I have to say that really sealed the deal . That was smart , because I have a soft spot for grandmas . So I am here , off Exit 9 , on the banks of the Old Raritan at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges . Winners of the first ever college football game . One of the newest members of the Big Ten . Home of what I understand to be a Grease Truck for a Fat Sandwich . Mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers on your cheesesteaks I am sure Michelle would approve . But somehow , you have survived such death defying acts . You also survived the daily jockeying for buses , from Livingston to Busch , to Cook , to Douglass , and back again . I suspect that a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon , after a late night at Olde Queens . You know who you are . But , however you got here , you made it . You made it . Today , you join a long line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heights its founders could not have imagined . Two hundred and fifty years ago , when America was still just an idea , a charter from the Royal Governor Ben Franklin s son established Queen s College . A few years later , a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for the first class . And from that first class in a pub , Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest research institutions in America . This is a place where you 3D print prosthetic hands for children , and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean , renewable energy . Every day , tens of thousands of students come here , to this intellectual melting pot , where ideas and cultures flow together among what might just be America s most diverse student body . Here in New Brunswick , you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class , and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus with a first generation Latina student from Jersey City , before sitting down for your psych group project with a veteran who is going to school on the Post 9 11 GI Bill . America converges here . And in so many ways , the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America the course by which we became bigger , stronger , and richer and more dynamic , and a more inclusive nation . But America s progress has never been smooth or steady . Progress does not travel in a straight line . It zigs and zags in fits and starts . Progress in America has been hard and contentious , and sometimes bloody . It remains uneven and at times , for every two steps forward , it feels like we take one step back . Now , for some of you , this may sound like your college career . It sounds like mine , anyway . Which makes sense , because measured against the whole of human history , America remains a very young nation younger , even , than this university . But progress is bumpy . It always has been . But because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists , progress has been this nation s hallmark . I am fond of quoting Dr . Martin Luther King , Jr . , who said , The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice . It bends towards justice . I believe that . But I also believe that the arc of our nation , the arc of the world does not bend towards justice , or freedom , or equality , or prosperity on its own . It depends on us , on the choices we make , particularly at certain inflection points in history particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs . And , Class of 2016 , you are graduating at such an inflection point . Since the start of this new millennium , you have already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks , and war , and a Great Recession . You have seen economic and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work and how we communicate , how we live , how we form families . The pace of change is not subsiding it is accelerating . And these changes offer not only great opportunity , but also great peril . Fortunately , your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future . I am confident that you can make the right choices away from fear and division and paralysis , and toward cooperation and innovation and hope . Now , partly , I am confident because , on average , you are smarter and better educated than my generation although we probably had better penmanship and were certainly better spellers . We did not have spell check back in my day . You are not only better educated , you have been more exposed to the world , more exposed to other cultures . You are more diverse . You are more environmentally conscious . You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom . So you have got the tools to lead us . And precisely because I have so much confidence in you , I am not going to spend the remainder of my time telling you exactly how you are going to make the world better . You will figure it out . You will look at things with fresher eyes , unencumbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandparents and old heads like me . But I do have a couple of suggestions that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world . Point number one When you hear someone longing for the good old days , take it with a grain of salt . Take it with a grain of salt . We live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history . We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before . But I guess it is part of human nature , especially in times of change and uncertainty , to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked , and the economy hummed , and all politicians were wise , and every kid was well mannered , and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world . Guess what . It am not so . The good old days were not that great . Yes , there have been some stretches in our history where the economy grew much faster , or when government ran more smoothly . There were moments when , immediately after World War Ifor example , or the end of the Cold War , when the world bent more easily to our will . But those are sporadic , those moments , those episodes . In fact , by almost every measure , America is better , and the world is better , than it was 50 years ago , or 30 years ago , or even eight years ago . And by the way , I am not set aside 150 years ago , pre Civil War there is a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about . Set aside life in the 50s , when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life . Since I graduated , in 1983 which is not that long ago I am just saying . Since I graduated , crime rates , teenage pregnancy , the share of Americans living in poverty they are all down . The share of Americans with college educations have gone way up . Our life expectancy has , as well . Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and politics . More women are in the workforce . They are earning more money although it is long past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men . Meanwhile , in the eight years since most of you started high school , we are also better off . You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better prospects than any time since 2007 . Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance . We are less dependent on foreign oil . We have doubled the production of clean energy . We have cut the high school dropout rate . We have cut the deficit by two thirds . Marriage equality is the law of the land . And just as America is better , the world is better than when I graduated . Since I graduated , an Iron Curtain fell , apartheid ended . There is more democracy . We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio . We have cut extreme poverty drastically . We have cut infant mortality by an enormous amount . Now , I say all these things not to make you complacent . We have got a bunch of big problems to solve . But I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history . And the reason America is better is because we did not look backwards we did not fear the future . We seized the future and made it our own . And that is exactly why it is always been young people like you that have brought about big change because you do not fear the future . That leads me to my second point The world is more interconnected than ever before , and it is becoming more connected every day . Building walls will not change that . Look , as President , my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States . And as citizens , we all rightly put our country first . But if the past two decades have taught us anything , it is that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation . When overseas states start falling apart , they become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores . When developing countries do not have functioning health systems , epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans , too . And a wall will not stop that . If we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes , we have got to have the cooperation of other countries in a global financial system to help enforce financial laws . The point is , to help ourselves we have got to help others not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out . And engagement does not just mean deploying our military . There are times where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our allies , and we are in awe of and we are grateful for the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known . But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military , and the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing . They cannot shoulder the entire burden . And engagement means using all the levers of our national power , and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges . You look at something like trade , for example . We live in an age of global supply chains , and cargo ships that crisscross oceans , and online commerce that can render borders obsolete . And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed that is one of the changes that is been taking place jobs shipped overseas , trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage . But the answer is not to stop trading with other countries . In this global economy , that is not even possible . The answer is to do trade the right way , by negotiating with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their environmental standards and we make sure they do not impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual property . That is how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values including human rights . And ultimately , that is how we help raise wages here in America . That is how we help our workers compete on a level playing field . Building walls will not do that . It will not boost our economy , and it will not enhance our security either . Isolating or disparaging Muslims , suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country that is not just a betrayal of our values that is not just a betrayal of who we are , it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism . Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders , and blame our challenges on immigrants that does not just run counter to our history as the world s melting pot it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe . That is how we became America . Why would we want to stop it now Cannot do it . Which brings me to my third point Facts , evidence , reason , logic , an understanding of science these are good things . These are qualities you want in people making policy . These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens . That might seem obvious . That is why we honor Bill Moyers or Dr . Burnell . We traditionally have valued those things . But if you were listening to today s political debate , you might wonder where this strain of anti intellectualism came from . So , Class of 2016 , let me be as clear as I can be . In politics and in life , ignorance is not a virtue . It is not cool to not know what you are talking about . That is not keeping it real , or telling it like it is . That is not challenging political correctness . That is just not knowing what you are talking about . And yet , we have become confused about this . Look , our nation s Founders Franklin , Madison , Hamilton , Jefferson they were born of the Enlightenment . They sought to escape superstition , and sectarianism , and tribalism , and no nothingness . They believed in rational thought and experimentation , and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates . That is embedded in our constitutional design . That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers , the Edisons and the Wright Brothers , and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers , and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses . That is what built this country . And today , in every phone in one of your pockets we have access to more information than at any time in human history , at a touch of a button . But , ironically , the flood of information has not made us more discerning of the truth . In some ways , it is just made us more confident in our ignorance . We assume whatever is on the web must be true . We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions . Opinions masquerade as facts . The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel . Now , understand , I am sure you have learned during your years of college and if not , you will learn soon that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense . That is the truth . You will meet them if you have not already . So the fact that they have got a fancy degree you got to talk to them to see whether they know what they are talking about . Qualities like kindness and compassion , honesty , hard work they often matter more than technical skills or know how . But when our leaders express a disdain for facts , when they are not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up , while actual experts are dismissed as elitists , then we have got a problem . You know , it is interesting that if we get sick , we actually want to make sure the doctors have gone to medical school , they know what they are talking about . If we get on a plane , we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane . And yet , in our public lives , we certainly think , I do not want somebody who is done it before . The rejection of facts , the rejection of reason and science that is the path to decline . It calls to mind the words of Carl Sagan , who graduated high school here in New Jersey he said We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers , our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good . The debate around climate change is a perfect example of this . Now , I recognize it does not feel like the planet is warmer right now . I understand . There was hail when I landed in Newark . But think about the climate change issue . Every day , there are officials in high office with responsibilities who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world s scientists that human activities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substances are altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways . A while back , you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as proof that the world was not warming . I mean , listen , climate change is not something subject to political spin . There is evidence . There are facts . We can see it happening right now . If we do not act , if we do not follow through on the progress we made in Paris , the progress we have been making here at home , your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe . So it is up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate . Imagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball , what he would think . Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that . He had get a And he is a senator Look , I am not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion , or faith , or love , or loyalty . I am suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well , and proposed budgets add up , and our environment is protected . And to accomplish those things , to make collective decisions on behalf of a common good , we have to use our heads . We have to agree that facts and evidence matter . And we got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they are talking about . All right . I only have two more points . I know it is getting cold and you guys have to graduate . Point four Have faith in democracy . Look , I know it is not always pretty . Really , I know . I have been living it . But it is how , bit by bit , generation by generation , we have made progress in this nation . That is how we banned child labor . That is how we cleaned up our air and our water . That is how we passed programs like Social Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty . None of these changes happened overnight . They did not happen because some charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything . It did not happen because some massive political revolution occurred . It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy , and organizing , and alliance building , and deal making , and the changing of public opinion . It happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political process . Well , that is nice . I mean , I helped , but Look , if you want to change this country for the better , you better start participating . I will give you an example on a lot of people s minds right now and that is the growing inequality in our economy . Over much of the last century , we have unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen , but over the past few decades , our economy has become more and more unequal . The top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all income in the In the past , it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the average worker . Today , it is 300 times more . And wages are not rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families . Now , if we want to reverse those trends , there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference . We can raise the minimum wage . We can modernize our infrastructure . We can invest in early childhood education . We can make college more affordable . We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement . And if we did these things , then we had help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody . Now , the reason some of these things have not happened , even though the majority of people approve of them , is really simple . It is not because I was not proposing them . It was not because the facts and the evidence showed they would not work . It was because a huge chunk of Americans , especially young people , do not vote . In 2014 , voter turnout was the lowest since World War IFewer than one in five young people showed up to vote 2014 . And the four who stayed home determined the course of this country just as much as the single one who voted . Because apathy has consequences . It determines who our Congress is . It determines what policies they prioritize . It even , for example , determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate . And , yes , big money in politics is a huge problem . We have got to reduce its influence . Yes , special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corridors of power . But , contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right , the system is not as rigged as you think , and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think . Politicians care about being elected , and they especially care about being reelected . And if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views , you will get what you want . And if you opt out , or stop paying attention , you will not . It is that simple . It is not that complicated . Now , one of the reasons that people do not vote is because they do not see the changes they were looking for right away . Well , guess what none of the great strides in our history happened right away . It took Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v . Board of Education and then another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act . And it took more time after that for it to start working . It took a proud daughter of New Jersey , Alice Paul , years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests , and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation , and writing letters and giving speeches , and working with congressional leaders before she and other suffragettes finally helped win women the right to vote . Each stage along the way required compromise . Sometimes you took half a loaf . You forged allies . Sometimes you lost on an issue , and then you came back to fight another day . That is how democracy works . So you have got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification , but you got to be a citizen full time , all the time . And if participation means voting , and it means compromise , and organizing and advocacy , it also means listening to those who do not agree with you . I know a couple years ago , folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement . Now , I do not think it is a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr . Rice and the previous administration . But the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State , or shutting out what she had to say I believe that is misguided . I do not think that is how democracy works best , when we are not even willing to listen to each other . I believe that is misguided . If you disagree with somebody , bring them in and ask them tough questions . Hold their feet to the fire . Make them defend their positions . If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea , prove it wrong . Engage it . Debate it . Stand up for what you believe in . Do not be scared to take somebody on . Do not feel like you got to shut your ears off because you are too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities . Go at them if they are not making any sense . Use your logic and reason and words . And by doing so , you will strengthen your own position , and you will hone your arguments . And maybe you will learn something and realize you do not know everything . And you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe . Either way , you win . And more importantly , our democracy wins . So , anyway , all right . That is it , Class of 2016 a few suggestions on how you can change the world . Except maybe I have got one last suggestion . Just one . And that is , gear yourself for the long haul . Whatever path you choose business , nonprofits , government , education , health care , the arts whatever it is , you are going to have some setbacks . You will deal occasionally with foolish people . You will be frustrated . You will have a boss that is not great . You will not always get everything you want at least not as fast as you want it . So you have to stick with it . You have to be persistent . And success , however small , however incomplete , success is still success . I always tell my daughters , you know , better is good . It may not be perfect , it may not be great , but it is good . That is how progress happens in societies and in our own lives . So do not lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock . Do not lose hope in the face of naysayers . And certainly do not let resistance make you cynical . Cynicism is so easy , and cynics do not accomplish much . As a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey , a guy named Bruce Springsteen , once sang they spend their lives waiting for a moment that just do not come . Do not let that be you . Do not waste your time waiting . If you doubt you can make a difference , look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already making . Look at what Matthew is doing . Look at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan , who began organizing anti bullying assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination , and here at Rutgers , helped found the Muslim Public Relations Council to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion . Look at somebody like Madison Little , who grew up dealing with some health issues , and started wondering what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else , and so , here at Rutgers , he took charge of a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to address the AIDS epidemic . Our generation has so much energy to adapt and impact the world , he said . My peers give me a lot of hope that we will overcome the obstacles we face in society . That is you Is it any wonder that I am optimistic Throughout our history , a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom , and more opportunity , and more justice . And , Class of 2016 , it is your turn now to shape our nation s destiny , as well as your own . So get to work . Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last . Good luck . God bless you . God bless this country we love . Thank you .
