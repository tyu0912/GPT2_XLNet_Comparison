Thank you . Well , I am excited , too . Of the many responsibilities granted to a President by our Constitution , few are more serious or more consequential than selecting a Supreme Court justice . The members of our highest court are granted life tenure , often serving long after the Presidents who appointed them . And they are charged with the vital task of applying principles put to paper more than 20 centuries ago to some of the most difficult questions of our time . So I do not take this decision lightly . I have made it only after deep reflection and careful deliberation . While there are many qualities that I admire in judges across the spectrum of judicial philosophy , and that I seek in my own nominee , there are few that stand out that I just want to mention . First and foremost is a rigorous intellect a mastery of the law , an ability to hone in on the key issues and provide clear answers to complex legal questions . Second is a recognition of the limits of the judicial role , an understanding that a judge s job is to interpret , not make , law to approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda , but rather a commitment to impartial justice a respect for precedent and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand . These two qualities are essential , I believe , for anyone who would sit on our nation s highest court . And yet , these qualities alone are insufficient . We need something more . For as Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said , The life of the law has not been logic it has been experience . Experience being tested by obstacles and barriers , by hardship and misfortune experience insisting , persisting , and ultimately overcoming those barriers . It is experience that can give a person a common touch and a sense of compassion an understanding of how the world works and how ordinary people live . And that is why it is a necessary ingredient in the kind of justice we need on the Supreme Court . The process of reviewing and selecting a successor to Justice Souter has been rigorous and comprehensive , not least because of the standard that Justice Souter himself has set with his formidable intellect and fair mindedness and decency . I have sought the advice of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle , including every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee . My team has reached out to constitutional scholars , advocacy organizations , and bar associations representing an array of interests and opinions . And I want to thank members of my staff and administration who have worked so hard and given so much of their time as part of this effort . After completing this exhaustive process , I have decided to nominate an inspiring woman who I believe will make a great justice Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the great state of New York . Over a distinguished career that spans three decades , Judge Sotomayor has worked at almost every level of our judicial system , providing her with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a Supreme Court justice . It is a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the District Court by a Republican President , George Bush , and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat , Bill Clinton . Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench , and more varied experience on the bench , than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed . Judge Sotomayor is a distinguished graduate of two of America s leading universities . She is been a big city prosecutor and a corporate litigator . She spent six years as a trial judge on the District Court , and would replace Justice Souter as the only justice with experience as a trial judge , a perspective that would enrich the judgments of the Court . For the past 11 years she has been a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of New York , one of the most demanding circuits in the country . There she has handed down decisions on a range of constitutional and legal questions that are notable for their careful reasoning , earning the respect of colleagues on the bench , the admiration of many lawyers who argue cases in her court , and the adoration of her clerks who look to her as a mentor . During her tenure on the District Court , she presided over roughly 450 cases . One case in particular involved a matter of enormous concern to many Americans , including me the baseball strike of 1994 1995 . In a decision that reportedly took her just 15 minutes to announce , a swiftness much appreciated by baseball fans everywhere she issued an injunction that helped end the strike . Some say that Judge Sotomayor saved baseball . Judge Sotomayor came to the District Court from a law firm where she was a partner focused on complex commercial litigation , gaining insight into the workings of a global economy . Before that she was a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA s office , serving under the legendary Robert Morgenthau , an early mentor of Sonia s who still sings her praises today . There , Sonia learned what crime can do to a family and a community , and what it takes to fight it . It is a career that has given her not only a sweeping overview of the American judicial system , but a practical understanding of how the law works in the everyday lives of the American people . But as impressive and meaningful as Judge Sotomayor s sterling credentials in the law is her own extraordinary journey . Born in the South Bronx , she was raised in a housing project not far from Yankee Stadium , making her a lifelong Yankee s fan . I hope this will not disqualify her in the eyes of the New Englanders in the Senate . Sonia s parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during the second world war , her mother as part of the Women s Army Corps . And , in fact , her mother is here today and I had like us all to acknowledge Sonia s mom . Sonia s mom has been a little choked up . But she , Sonia s mother , began a family tradition of giving back to this country . Sonia s father was a factory worker with a 3rd grade education who did not speak English . But like Sonia s mother , he had a willingness to work hard , a strong sense of family , and a belief in the American Dream . When Sonia was nine , her father passed away . And her mother worked six days a week as a nurse to provide for Sonia and her brother who is also here today , is a doctor and a terrific success in his own right . But Sonia s mom bought the only set of encyclopedias in the neighborhood , sent her children to a Catholic school called Cardinal Spellman out of the belief that with a good education here in America all things are possible . With the support of family , friends , and teachers , Sonia earned scholarships to Princeton , where she graduated at the top of her class , and Yale Law School , where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal , stepping onto the path that led her here today . Along the way she is faced down barriers , overcome the odds , lived out the American Dream that brought her parents here so long ago . And even as she has accomplished so much in her life , she has never forgotten where she began , never lost touch with the community that supported her . What Sonia will bring to the Court , then , is not only the knowledge and experience acquired over a course of a brilliant legal career , but the wisdom accumulated from an inspiring life s journey . It is my understanding that Judge Sotomayor s interest in the law was sparked as a young girl by reading the Nancy Drew series and that when she was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of eight , she was informed that people with diabetes cannot grow up to be police officers or private investigators like Nancy Drew . And that is when she was told she had have to scale back her dreams . Well , Sonia , what you have shown in your life is that it does not matter where you come from , what you look like , or what challenges life throws your way no dream is beyond reach in the United States of America . And when Sonia Sotomayor ascends those marble steps to assume her seat on the highest court of the land , America will have taken another important step towards realizing the ideal that is etched above its entrance Equal justice under the law . I hope the Senate acts in a bipartisan fashion , as it has in confirming Judge Sotomayor twice before , and as swiftly as possible so that she can take her seat on the Court in September and participate in deliberations as the Court chooses which cases it will hear this coming year . And with that , I had like all of you to give a warm greeting as I invite Judge Sotomayor to say a few words .<speech_sep>Madam Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , the First Lady of the United States she is around here somewhere I have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great Chamber , but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here . I know that for many Americans watching right now , the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others , and rightly so . If you have not been personally affected by this recession , you probably know someone who has a friend , a neighbor , a member of your family . You do not need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis , because you live it every day . It is the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights . It is the job you thought you had retire from but now have lost , the business you built your dreams upon that is now hanging by a thread , the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope . The impact of this recession is real , and it is everywhere . But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation . The answers to our problems do not lie beyond our reach . They exist in our laboratories and our universities , in our fields and our factories , in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth . Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history , we still possess in ample measure . What is required now is for this country to pull together , confront boldly the challenges we face , and take responsibility for our future once more . Now , if we are honest with ourselves , we will admit that for too long , we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people . I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards , but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we will be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament . The fact is , our economy did not fall into decline overnight , nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank . We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy , yet we import more oil today than ever before . The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year , yet we keep delaying reform . Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for . And though all these challenges went unsolved , we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt , both as individuals and through our Government , than ever before . In other words , we have lived through an era where too often short term gains were prized over long term prosperity , where we failed to look beyond the next payment , the next quarter , or the next election . A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future . Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market . People bought homes they knew they could not afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway . And all the while , critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time , on some other day . Well , that day of reckoning has arrived , and the time to take charge of our future is here . Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy , but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity . Now is the time to jumpstart job creation , restart lending , and invest in areas like energy , health care , and education that will grow our economy , even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down . That is what my economic agenda is designed to do , and that is what I had like to talk to you about tonight . It is an agenda that begins with jobs . As soon as I took office , I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets , not because I believe in bigger Government I do not not because I am not mindful of the massive debt we have inherited I am . I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship . In fact , a failure to act would have worsened our long term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years . And that is why I pushed for quick action . And tonight I am grateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law . Over the next 2 years , this plan will save or create 3 . 5 million jobs . More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges , constructing wind turbines and solar panels , laying broadband and expanding mass transit . Because of this plan , there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids , health care professionals can continue caring for our sick . There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make . Because of this plan , 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st . Because of this plan , families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a 2 , 500 tax credit for all 4 years of college , and Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm . Now , I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work , and I understand that skepticism . Here in Washington , we have all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending . And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right . And that is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough , unprecedented oversight effort because nobody messes with Joe . I am I right They do not mess with him . I have told each of my Cabinet , as well as mayors and Governors across the country , that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend . I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud . And we have created a new web site called recovery . gov , so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent . So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track . But it is just the first step . Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly , there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system . I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight , because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family s well being . You should also know that the money you have deposited in banks across the country is safe , your insurance is secure , you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system . That is not the source of concern . The concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country , our recovery will be choked off before it even begins . You see , the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy . The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education , how stores stock their shelves , farms buy equipment , and businesses make payroll . But credit has stopped flowing the way it should . Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks . And with so much debt and so little confidence , these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households , to businesses , or even to each other . And when there is no lending , families cannot afford to buy homes or cars , so businesses are forced to make layoffs . Our economy suffers even more , and credit dries up even further . That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle , to restore confidence , and restart lending . And we will do so in several ways . First , we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans , college loans , and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running . Second , we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages . It is a plan that will not help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford , but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about . In fact , the average family who refinances today can save nearly 2 , 000 per year on their mortgage . Third , we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times . And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems , we will hold accountable those responsible , force the necessary adjustments , provide the support to clean up their balance sheets , and assure the continuity of a strong , viable institution that can serve our people and our economy . Now , I understand that on any given day , Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions . But such an approach will not solve the problem , and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all . And I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive , and this time , they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer . This time , CEOs will not be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet . Those days are over . Still , this plan will require significant resources from the Federal Government and , yes , probably more than we have already set aside . But while the cost of action will be great , I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater , for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years , but perhaps a decade . That would be worse for our deficit , worse for business , worse for you , and worse for the next generation . And I refuse to let that happen . Now , I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks , Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed . So were the American taxpayers so was So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now , especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions . I promise you , I get it . But I also know that in a time of crisis , we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment . My job our job is to solve the problem . Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility . I will not send I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive , but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that cannot pay its workers or the family that has saved and still cannot get a mortgage . That is what this is about . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . Because when credit is available again , that young family can finally buy a new home . And then some company will hire workers to build it . And then those workers will have money to spend . And if they can get a loan too , maybe they will finally buy that car or open their own business . Investors will return to the market , and American families will see their retirement secured once more . Slowly but surely , confidence will return and our economy will recover . So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary , because we cannot consign our Nation to an open ended recession . And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system . It is time to put in place tough , new , commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation , and punishes shortcuts and abuse . The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we are taking to revive our economy in the short term . But the only way to fully restore America s economic strength is to make the long term investments that will lead to new jobs , new industries , and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world . The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care , the schools that are not preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit . That is our responsibility . In the next few days , I will submit a budget to Congress . So often , we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs . I see this document differently . I see it as a vision for America , as a blueprint for our future . My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue . It reflects the stark reality of what we have inherited , a trillion dollar deficit , a financial crisis , and a costly recession . Given these realities , everyone in this Chamber , Democrats and Republicans , will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars . And that includes me . But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long term challenges . I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves , that says Government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity . For history tells a different story . History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation , this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas . In the midst of Civil War , we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry . From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age . In the wake of war and depression , the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history . And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways , an American on the Moon , and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world . In each case , Government did not supplant private enterprise it catalyzed private enterprise . It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive . We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal . Now we must be that nation again , and that is why , even as it cuts back on programs we do not need , the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future energy , health care , and education . It begins with energy . We know the country that harnesses the power of clean , renewable energy will lead the 21st century . And yet , it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient . We invented solar technology , but we have fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it . New plug in hybrids roll off our assembly lines , but they will run on batteries made in Korea . Well , I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders , and I know you do not either . It is time for America to lead again . Thanks to our recovery plan , we will double this Nation s supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years . We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history , an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology . We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country . And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills . But to truly transform our economy , to protect our security , and save our planet from the ravages of climate change , we need to ultimately make clean , renewable energy the profitable kind of energy . So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America . That is what we need . And to support that innovation , we will invest 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power , advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . Speaking of our auto industry , everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink . We should not , and will not , protect them from their own bad practices . But we are committed to the goal of a retooled , reimagined auto industry that can compete and win . Millions of jobs depend on it scores of communities depend on it . And I believe the Nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it . Now , none of this will come without cost , nor will it be easy . But this is America . We do not do what is easy . We do what is necessary to move this country forward . And for that same reason , we must also address the crushing cost of health care . This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds . By the end of the year , it could cause 1 . 5 million Americans to lose their homes . In the last 8 years , premiums have grown four times faster than wages . And in each of these years , 1 million more Americans have lost their health insurance . It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas . And it is one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget . Given these facts , we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold . We cannot afford to do it . It is time . Already , we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than we have done in the last decade . When it was days old , this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time . Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records , a new technology that will reduce errors , bring down costs , ensure privacy , and save lives . It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American , including me , by seeking a cure for cancer in our time . And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care , because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control . This budget builds on these reforms . It includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform , a down payment on the principle that we must have quality , affordable health care for every American . It is a commitment that is paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue . And it is a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come . Now , there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform , and that is why I am bringing together businesses and workers , doctors and health care providers , Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week . I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process . Once again , it will be hard . But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform , the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough . So let there be no doubt Health care reform cannot wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America . In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge , a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity , it is a prerequisite . Right now , three quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma . And yet , just over half of our citizens have that level of education . We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation , and half of the students who begin college never finish . This is a prescription for economic decline , because we know the countries that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow . That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education , from the day they are born to the day they begin a career . That is a promise we have to make to the children of America . Already , we have made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan . We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality , because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life . We have made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students 7 million . And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children s progress . But we know that our schools do not just need more resources , they need more reform . And that is why this budget creates new teachers new incentives for teacher performance , pathways for advancement , and rewards for success . We will invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps , and we will expand our commitment to charter schools . It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work . But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it . So tonight I ask every American to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training . This can be community college or a 4 year school , vocational training or an apprenticeship . But whatever the training may be , every American will need to get more than a high school diploma . And dropping out of high school is no longer an option . It is not just quitting on yourself , it is quitting on your country , and this country needs and values the talents of every American . That is why we will support we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans to complete college and meet a new goal . By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . That is a goal we can meet . That is a goal we can meet . Now , I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever , which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country , we will make sure that you can afford a higher education . And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations , I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch , as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country , Senator Edward Kennedy . These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children , but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them . In the end , there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent , for a mother or father who will attend those parent teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the Tput away the video games , read to their child . I speak to you not just as a President , but as a father , when I say that responsibility for our children s education must begin at home . That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue that is an American issue . There is , of course , another responsibility we have to our children . And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay . That is critical . I agree , absolutely . See , I know we can get some consensus in here . With the deficit we inherited , the cost of the crisis we face , and the long term challenges we must meet , it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers , we do what it takes to bring this deficit down . That is critical . Now , I am proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks , and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities . And yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office . My administration has also begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs . As you can imagine , this is a process that will take some time . But we have already identified 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . In this budget , we will end education programs that do not work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that do not need them . We will eliminate the no bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we are not paying for cold war era weapons systems we do not use . We will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that does not make our seniors any healthier . We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax Code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas . In order to save our children from a future of debt , we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Now , let me be clear let me be absolutely clear , because I know you will end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people If your family earns less than 250 , 000 a year , a quarter million dollars a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . I repeat Not one single dime . In fact not a dime in fact , the recovery plan provides a tax cut that is right , a tax cut for 95 percent of working families . And by the way , these checks are on the way . Now , to preserve our long term fiscal health , we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security . Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come . And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security , while creating tax free universal savings accounts for all Americans . Finally , because we are also suffering from a deficit of trust , I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget . That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules . And for the first time , that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . For 7 years , we have been a nation at war . No longer will we hide its price . Along with our outstanding national security team , I am now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars , and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war . And with our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat extremism , because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world . We will not allow it . As we meet here tonight , our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy . To each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence , Americans are united in sending one message We honor your service we are inspired by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding support . To relieve the strain on our forces , my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines . And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve , we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned . To overcome extremism , we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend , because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America . And that is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists . Because living our values does not make us weaker , it makes us safer and it makes us stronger . And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture . We can make that commitment here tonight . In words and deeds , we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun . For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone , but the world cannot meet them without America . We cannot shun the negotiating table , nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm . We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand . To seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors , we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort . To meet the challenges of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear proliferation , from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty we will strengthen old alliances , forge new ones , and use all elements of our national power . And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope , we are working with the nations of the G 20 to restore confidence in our financial system , avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism , and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe . For the world depends on us having a strong economy , just as our economy depends on the strength of the world s . As we stand at this crossroads of history , the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us , watching to see what we do with this moment , waiting for us to lead . Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times . It is a tremendous burden , but also a great privilege , one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans . For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill . I know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth , to become cynical and doubtful , consumed with the petty and the trivial . But in my life , I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places , that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity , but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are anything but ordinary . I think of Leonard Abess , a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company , took a 60 million bonus , and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him , plus another 72 who used to work for him . He did not tell anyone , but when the local newspaper found out , he simply said , I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old . It did not feel right getting the money myself . I think about Greensburg , Kansas , a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado , but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community , how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay . The tragedy was terrible , said one of the men who helped them rebuild . But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity . I think about Ty Sheoma Bethea , the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon , South Carolina , a place where the ceilings leak , the paint peels off the walls , and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom . She had been told that her school is hopeless , but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber . She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp . The letter asks us for help and says We are just students trying to become lawyers , doctors , Congressmen like yourself , and one day President , so we can make a change to not just the State of South Carolina but also the world . We are not quitters . That is what she said We are not quitters . These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here . They tell us that even in the most trying times , amid the most difficult circumstances , there is a generosity , a resilience , a decency , and a determination that perseveres , a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity . Their resolve must be our inspiration . Their concerns must be our cause . And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us . I know look , I know that we have not agreed on every issue thus far . There are surely times in the future where we will part ways . But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed . I know that . That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done . That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground . And if we do , if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths of this crisis , if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity , if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit , then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed , in the words that are carved into this very Chamber , something worthy to be remembered . Thank you . God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>Thank you so much . Good afternoon . I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions . For over a thousand years , Al Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning , and for over a century , Cairo University has been a source of Egypt s advancement . And together , you represent the harmony between tradition and progress . I am grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt . And I am also proud to carry with me the good will of the American people and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country As salaamu alaykum . We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world , tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate . The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation , but also conflict and religious wars . More recently , tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims and a cold war in which Muslim majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations . Moreover , the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam . Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small , but potent minority of Muslims . The attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries , but also to human rights . All this has bred more fear and more mistrust . So long as our relationship is defined by our differences , we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace , those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity . And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end . I have come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world , one based on mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition . Instead , they overlap and share common principles , principles of justice and progress , tolerance and the dignity of all human beings . I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight . I know there is been a lot of publicity about this speech , but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust . Nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point . But I am convinced that in order to move forward , we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors . There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other , to learn from each other , to respect one another , and to seek common ground . As the Holy Koran tells us Be conscious of God and speak always the truth . That is what I will try to do today , to speak the truth as best I can , humbled by the task before us and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart . Now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience . I am a Christian , but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims . As a boy , I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk . As a young man , I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith . As a student of history , I also know civilization s debt to Islam . It was Islam , at places like Al Azhar , that carried the light of learning through so many centuries , paving the way for Europe s renaissance and enlightenment . It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra , our magnetic compass and tools of navigation , our mastery of pens and printing , our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed . Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires , timeless poetry and cherished music , elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation . And throughout history , Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality . I also know that Islam has always been a part of America s story . The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco . In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796 , our second President , John Adams , wrote The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion , or tranquillity of Muslims . And since our founding , American Muslims have enriched the United States . They have fought in our wars they have served in our government they have stood for civil rights they have started businesses they have taught at our universities they have excelled in our sports arenas they have won Nobel Prizes , built our tallest building , and lit the Olympic Torch . And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress , he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers , Thomas Jefferson , kept in his personal library . So , I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed . That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is , not what it is not . And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear . But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America . Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype , America is not the crude stereotype of a self interested empire . The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known . We were born out of revolution against an empire . We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal , and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words , within our borders and around the world . We are shaped by every culture , drawn from every end of the Earth , and dedicated to a simple concept E pluribus unum Out of many , one . Now , much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President . But my personal story is not so unique . The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America , but its promise exists for all who come to our shores , and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today , who , by the way , enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the American average . Moreover , freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one s religion . That is why there is a mosque in every State in our Union and over 1 , 200 mosques within our borders . That is why the United States Government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab and to punish those who would deny it . So let there be no doubt , Islam is a part of America . And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race , religion , or station in life , all of us share common aspirations to live in peace and security , to get an education and to work with dignity , to love our families , our communities , and our God . These things we share . This is the hope of all humanity . Of course , recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task . Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people . These needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all . For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country , prosperity is hurt everywhere . When a new flu infects one human being , all are at risk . When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon , the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations . When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains , people are endangered across an ocean . When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered , that is a stain on our collective conscience . That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century . That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings . And this is a difficult responsibility to embrace , for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes and , yes , religions subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests . Yet in this new age , such attitudes are self defeating . Given our interdependence , any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail . So whatever we think of the past , we must not be prisoners to it . Our problems must be dealt with through partnership our progress must be shared . Now , that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension . Indeed , it suggests the opposite . We must face these tensions squarely . And so in that spirit , let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together . The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms . In Ankara , I made clear that America is not , and never will be , at war with Islam . We will , however , relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security , because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject the killing of innocent men , women , and children . And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people . The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America s goals and our need to work together . Over 7 years ago , the United States pursued Al Qaida and the Taliban with broad international support . We did not go by choice we went because of necessity . I am aware that there is still some who would question or even justify the events of 9 11 . But let us be clear Al Qaida killed nearly 3 , 000 people on that day . The victims were innocent men , women , and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody . And yet , Al Qaida chose to ruthlessly murder these people , claimed credit for the attack , and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale . They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach . These are not opinions to be debated these are facts to be dealt with . Make no mistake , we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan . We see no we seek no military bases there . It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women . It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict . We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home , if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can . But that is not yet the case . And that is why we are partnering with a coalition of 46 countries . And despite the costs involved , America s commitment will not weaken . Indeed , none of us should tolerate these extremists . They have killed in many countries . They have killed people of different faiths , but more than any other , they have killed Muslims . Their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings , the progress of nations , and with Islam . The Holy Koran teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as it is as if he has killed all mankind . And the Holy Koran also says , whoever saves a person , it is as if he has saved all mankind . The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few . Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism , it is an important part of promoting peace . Now , we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan . That is why we plan to invest 1 . 5 billion each year over the next 5 years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals , roads and businesses , and hundreds of millions to help those who have been displaced . That is why we are providing more than 2 . 8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on . Let me also address the issue of Iraq . Unlike Afghanistan , Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world . Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein , I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible . Indeed , we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson , who said I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power , the greater it will be . Today , America has a dual responsibility to help Iraq forge a better future and to leave Iraq to Iraqis . And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases and no claim on their territory or resources . Iraq s sovereignty is its own . And that is why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August . That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq s democratically elected Government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012 . We will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy , but we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner , and never as a patron . And finally , just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists , we must never alter or forget our principles . Nine eleven was an enormous trauma to our country . The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable , but in some cases , it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals . We are taking concrete actions to change course . I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States , and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year . So America will defend itself , respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law , and we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities , which are also threatened . The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities , the sooner we will all be safer . The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis , Palestinians , and the Arab world . America s strong bonds with Israel are well known . This bond is unbreakable . It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied . Around the world , the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries , and anti Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust . Tomorrow I will visit Buchenwald , which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved , tortured , shot , and gassed to death by the Third Reich . Six million Jews were killed , more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today . Denying that fact is baseless , it is ignorant , and it is hateful . Threatening Israel with destruction or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve . On the other hand , it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people , Muslims and Christians , have suffered in pursuit of a homeland . For more than 60 years , they have endured the pain of dislocation . Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank , Gaza , and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead . They endure the daily humiliations , large and small , that come with occupation . So let there be no doubt , the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable , and America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity , opportunity , and a state of their own . For decades then , there has been a stalemate two peoples with legitimate aspirations , each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive . It is easy to point fingers , for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel s founding and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders , as well as beyond . But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other , then we will be blind to the truth . The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states , where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security . That is in Israel s interest , Palestine s interest , America s interest , and the world s interest . And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires . The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear . For peace to come , it is time for them , and all of us , to live up to our responsibilities . Palestinians must abandon violence . Resistance through violence and killing is wrong , and it does not succeed . For centuries , black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation . But it was not violence that won full and equal rights . It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America s founding . This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia , from Eastern Europe to Indonesia . It is a story with a simple truth Violence is a dead end . It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children or to blow up old women on a bus . That is not how moral authority is claimed that is how it is surrendered . Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build . The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern with institutions that serve the needs of its people . Hamas does have support among some Palestinians , but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities . To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations , to unify the Palestinian people , Hamas must put an end to violence , recognize past agreements , recognize Israel s right to exist . At the same time , Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel s right to exist cannot be denied , neither can Palestine s . The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements . This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace . It is time for these settlements to stop . And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society . Just as it devastates Palestinian families , the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel s security , neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank . Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace , and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress . And finally , the Arab States must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning , but not the end of their responsibilities . The Arab Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems . Instead , it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state , to recognize Israel s legitimacy , and to choose progress over a self defeating focus on the past . America will align our policies with those who pursue peace , and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs . We cannot impose peace . But privately , many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away . Likewise , many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state . It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true . Too many tears have been shed . Too much blood has been shed . All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear , when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be , when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra , when Moses , Jesus , and Muhammed , peace be upon them , joined in prayer . The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons . This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran . For many years , Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country , and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us . In the middle of the cold war , the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian Government . Since the Islamic Revolution , Iran has played a role in acts of hostage taking and violence against troops and civilians . This history is well known . Rather than remain trapped in the past , I have made it clear to Iran s leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward . The question now is not what Iran is against , but rather what future it wants to build . I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust , but we will proceed with courage , rectitude , and resolve . There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries , and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect . But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons , we have reached a decisive point . This is not simply about America s interests . It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path . I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not . No single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons . And that is why I strongly reaffirmed America s commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons . And any nation , including Iran , should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power , if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty . That commitment is at the core of the treaty , and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it . And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal . The fourth issue that I will address is democracy . I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years , and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq . So let me be clear No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other . That does not lessen my commitment , however , to governments that reflect the will of the people . Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way , grounded in the traditions of its own people . America does not presume to know what is best for everyone , just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election . But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed , confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice , government that is transparent and does not steal from the people , the freedom to live as you choose . These are not just American ideas , they are human rights . And that is why we will support them everywhere . Now , there is no straight line to realize this promise , but this much is clear Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable , successful , and secure . Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . America respects the right of all peaceful and law abiding voices to be heard around the world , even if we disagree with them . And we will welcome all elected , peaceful governments , provided they govern with respect for all their people . This last point is important , because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they are out of power . Once in power , they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others . So no matter where it takes hold , government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power . You must maintain your power through consent , not coercion you must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party . Without these ingredients , elections alone do not make true democracy . Audience member . We love you The President . Thank you . The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom . Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance . We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition . I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia , where devout Christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country . That is the spirit we need today . People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul . This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive , but it is being challenged in many different ways . Among some Muslims , there is a disturbing tendency to measure one s own faith by the rejection of somebody else s faith . The richness of religious diversity must be upheld , whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt . And if we are being honest , fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well , as the divisions between Sunni and Shi a have led to tragic violence , particularly in Iraq . Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together . We must always examine the ways in which we protect it . For instance , in the United States , rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation . That is why I am committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat . Likewise , it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit , for instance , by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear . We cannot disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism . In fact , faith should bring us together . And that is why we are forging service projects in America to bring together Christians , Muslims , and Jews . That is why we welcome efforts like Saudi Arabian King Abdallah s interfaith dialog and Turkey s leadership in the Alliance of Civilizations . Around the world , we can turn dialog into interfaith service , so bridges between peoples lead to action , whether it is combating malaria in Africa or providing relief after a natural disaster . The sixth issue that I want to address is women s rights . I know I know , and you can tell from this audience , that there is a healthy debate about this issue . I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal , but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality . And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to be prosperous . Now , let me be clear Issues of women s equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam . In Turkey , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Indonesia , we have seen Muslim majority countries elect a woman to lead . Meanwhile , the struggle for women s equality continues in many aspects of American life and in countries around the world . I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons . Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity , men and women , to reach their full potential . I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal , and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles . But it should be their choice . And that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim majority country to support expanded literacy for girls and to help young women pursue employment through microfinancing that helps people live their dreams . Finally , I want to discuss economic development and opportunity . I know that for many , the face of globalization is contradictory . The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information , but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home . Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities , but also huge disruptions and change in communities . In all nations , including America , this change can bring fear . Fear that because of modernity , we lose control over our economic choices , our politics , and , most importantly , our identities , those things we most cherish about our communities , our families , our traditions , and our faith . But I also know that human progress cannot be denied . There need not be contradictions between development and tradition . Countries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures . The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai . In ancient times and in our times , Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education . And this is important , because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground , nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work . Many Gulf States have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil , and some are beginning to focus it on broader development . But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century , and in too many Muslim communities there remains underinvestment in these areas . I am emphasizing such investment within my own country . And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world , we now seek a broader engagement . On education , we will expand exchange programs and increase scholarships like the one that brought my father to America . At the same time , we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities . And we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America , invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world , and create a new online network so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo . On economic development , we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim majority countries . And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders , foundations , and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world . On science and technology , we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim majority countries and to help transfer ideas to mark to the marketplace so they can create more jobs . We will open centers of scientific excellence in Africa , the Middle East , and Southeast Asia and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy , create green jobs , digitize records , clean water , grow new crops . Today I am announcing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio . And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health . All these things must be done in partnership . Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments , community organizations , religious leaders , and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life . And the issues that I have described will not be easy to address , but we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek , a world where extremists no longer threaten our people and American troops have come home , a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes , a world where governments serve their citizens and the rights of all God s children are respected . Those are mutual interests . That is the world we seek , but we can only achieve it together . I know there are many , Muslim and non Muslim , who question whether we can forge this new beginning . Some are eager to stoke the flames of division and to stand in the way of progress . Some suggest that it is not worth the effort , that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash . Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur . There is so much fear , so much mistrust that has built up over the years . But if we choose to be bound by the past , we will never move forward . And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country You , more than anyone , have the ability to reimagine the world , to remake this world . All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time . The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart , or whether we commit ourselves to an effort , a sustained effort to find common ground , to focus on the future we seek for our children , and to respect the dignity of all human beings . It is easier to start wars than to end them . It is easier to blame others than to look inward . It is easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share . But we should choose the right path , not just the easy path . There is one rule that lies at the heart of every religion , that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us . This truth transcends nations and peoples , a belief that is not new , that is not black or white or brown , that is not Christian or Muslim or Jew . It is a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world . It is a faith in other people , and it is what brought me here today . We have the power to make the world we seek , but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning , keeping in mind what has been written . The Holy Koran tells us O mankind We have created you male and a female , and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another . The Talmud tells us The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace . The Holy Bible tells us Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God . The people of the world can live together in peace . We know that is God s vision , now that must be our work here on Earth . Thank you , and may God s peace be upon you . Thank you very much . Thank you .<speech_sep>Madam Speaker , Vice President Biden , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Our Constitution declares that from time to time , the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our Union . For 220 years , our leaders have fulfilled this duty . They have done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility , and they have done so in the midst of war and depression , at moments of great strife and great struggle . It is tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable , that America was always destined to succeed . But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach , victory was very much in doubt . When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday , the future was anything but certain . These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our Union . And despite all our divisions and disagreements , our hesitations and our fears , America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation , as one people . Again , we are tested . And again , we must answer history s call . One year ago , I took office amid two wars , an economy rocked by a severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a Government deeply in debt . Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act , we might face a second depression . So we acted , immediately and aggressively . And 1 year later , the worst of the storm has passed . But the devastation remains . One in 10 Americans still cannot find work . Many businesses have shuttered . Home values have declined . Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard . And for those who d already known poverty , life s become that much harder . This recession has also compounded the burdens that America s families have been dealing with for decades the burden of working harder and longer for less , of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college . So I know the anxieties that are out there right now . They are not new . These struggles are the reason I ran for President . These struggles are what I have witnessed for years , in places like Elkhart , Indiana Galesburg , Illinois . I hear about them in the letters that I read each night . The toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home , asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work . For these Americans and so many others , change has not come fast enough . Some are frustrated , some are angry . They do not understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded , but hard work on Main Street is not , or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems . They are tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness . They know we cannot afford it . Not now . So we face big and difficult challenges . And what the American people hope , what they deserve , is for all of us , Democrats and Republicans , to work through our differences , to overcome the numbing weight of our politics . For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds , different stories , different beliefs , the anxieties they face are the same . The aspirations they hold are shared a job that pays the bills a chance to get ahead most of all , the ability to give their children a better life . And you know what else they share They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity . After one of the most difficult years in our history , they remain busy building cars and teaching kids , starting businesses and going back to school . They are coaching Little League and helping their neighbors . One woman wrote to me and said , We are strained but hopeful , struggling but encouraged . It is because of this spirit , this great decency and great strength , that I have never been more hopeful about America s future than I am tonight . Despite our hardships , our Union is strong . We do not give up . We do not quit . We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit . In this new decade , it is time the American people get a Government that matches their decency , that embodies their strength . And tonight I had like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise . It begins with our economy . Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis . It was not easy to do . And if there is one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between , it is that we all hated the bank bailout . I hated it . I hated it you hated it . It was about as popular as a root canal . But when I ran for President , I promised I would not just do what was popular I would do what was necessary . And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system , unemployment might be double what it is today . More businesses would certainly have closed . More homes would have surely been lost . So I supported the last administration s efforts to create the financial rescue program . And when we took that program over , we made it more transparent and more accountable . And as a result , the markets are now stabilized , and we have recovered most of the money we spent on the banks most but not all . To recover the rest , I have proposed a fee on the biggest banks . Now , I know Wall Street is not keen on this idea . But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again , they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need . Now , as we stabilized the financial system , we also took steps to get our economy growing again , save as many jobs as possible , and help Americans who had become unemployed . That is why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans , made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRand passed 25 different tax cuts . Now , let me repeat We cut taxes . We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families . We cut taxes for small businesses . We cut taxes for first time home buyers . We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children . We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college . I thought I had get some applause on that one . As a result , millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities , all of which helped businesses keep more workers . And we have not raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person not a single dime . Now , because of the steps we took , there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed . Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy . Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers . Tens of thousands are cops , firefighters , correctional officers , first responders . And we are on track to add another 1 frac12 million jobs to this total by the end of the year . The plan that has made all of this possible , from the tax cuts to the jobs , is the Recovery Act . That is right , the Recovery Act , also known as the stimulus bill . Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster . But you do not have to take their word for it . Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act . Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act , until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created . Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act , she would not be laid off after all . There are stories like this all across America . And after 2 years of recession , the economy is growing again . Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value . Businesses are beginning to invest again , and slowly some are starting to hire again . But I realize that for every success story , there are other stories , of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from , who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response . That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010 , and that is why I am calling for a new jobs bill tonight . Now , the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America s businesses . I agree , absolutely . But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers . We should start where most new jobs do , in small businesses , companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it is time she became her own boss . Through sheer grit and determination , these companies have weathered the recession , and they are ready to grow . But when you talk to small business owners in places like Allentown , Pennsylvania , or Elyria , Ohio , you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again , they are mostly lending to bigger companies . Financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country , even those that are making a profit . So tonight I am proposing that we take 30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat . I am also proposing a new small business tax credit , one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages . While we are at it , let us also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment . Next , we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow . From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System , our Nation has always been built to compete . There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products . Tomorrow I will visit Tampa , Florida , where workers will soon break ground on a new high speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act . There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation s goods , services , and information . We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient , which supports clean energy jobs . And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders , it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America . Now , the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps . As the first order of business this year , I urge the Senate to do the same , and I know they will . They will . People are out of work . They are hurting . They need our help . And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay . But the truth is , these steps will not make up for the 7 million jobs that we have lost over the last 2 years . The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problems that America s families have confronted for years . We cannot afford another so called economic expansion like the one from the last decade , what some call the lost decade , where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion , where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs , where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation . From the day I took office , I have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious . I have been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while . For those who make these claims , I have one simple question How long should we wait How long should America put its future on hold You see , Washington has been telling us to wait for decades , even as the problems have grown worse . Meanwhile , China s not waiting to revamp its economy . Germany s not waiting . India s not waiting . These nations are they are not standing still . These nations are not playing for second place . They are putting more emphasis on math and science . They are rebuilding their infrastructure . They are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs . Well , I do not accept second place for the United States of America . As hard as it may be , as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become , it is time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth . Now , one place to start is serious financial reform . Look , I am not interested in punishing banks . I am interested in protecting our economy . A strong , healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs . It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes . But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy . We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions . We cannot allow financial institutions , including those that take your deposits , to take risks that threaten the whole economy . Now , the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes , and the lobbyists are trying to kill it . But we cannot let them win this fight . And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform , I will send it back until we get it right . We have got to get it right . Next , we need to encourage American innovation . Last year , we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history , an investment that could lead to the world s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched . And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy . You can see the results of last year s investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1 , 200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels . But to create more of these clean energy jobs , we need more production , more efficiency , more incentives . And that means building a new generation of safe , clean nuclear powerplants in this country . It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development . It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies . And , yes , it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America . Now , I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year . And this year , I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate . I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy . I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change . But here s the thing Even if you doubt the evidence , providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future , because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy . And America must be that nation . Third , we need to export more of our goods , because the more products we make and sell to other countries , the more jobs we support right here in America . So tonight we set a new goal We will double our exports over the next 5 years , an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America . To help meet this goal , we are launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security . We have to seek new markets aggressively , just as our competitors are . If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals , we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores . But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules . And that is why we will continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia . Fourth , we need to invest in the skills and education of our people . Now , this year , we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools . And the idea here is simple Instead of rewarding failure , we only reward success . Instead of funding the status quo , we only invest in reform , reform that raises student achievement , inspires students to excel in math and science , and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans , from rural communities to the inner city . In the 21st century , the best antipoverty program around is a world class education . And in this country , the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential . When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States . Still , in this economy , a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job . That is why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges , which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families . To make college more affordable , this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans . Instead , let us take that money and give families a 10 , 000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants . And let us tell another 1 million students that when they graduate , they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they chose to go to college . And by the way , it is time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs , because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem . Now , the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class . That is why last year , I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families . That is why we are nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg . That is why we are working to lift the value of a family s single largest investment , their home . The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of 1 , 500 on mortgage payments . This year , we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages . And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform . Yes , we do . Now , let us clear a few things up . I did not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt . And by now it should be fairly obvious that I did not take on health care because it was good politics . I took on health care because of the stories I have heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage , patients who have been denied coverage , families , even those with insurance , who are just one illness away from financial ruin . After nearly a century of trying Democratic administrations , Republican administrations we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans . The approach we have taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry . It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market . It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care . And by the way , I want to acknowledge our First Lady , Michelle Obama , who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier . Thank you , honey . She gets embarrassed . Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan . It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses . And according to the Congressional Budget Office , the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress , our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as 1 trillion over the next two decades . Still , this is a complex issue , and the longer it was debated , the more skeptical people became . I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people . And I know that with all the lobbying and horse trading , the process left most Americans wondering , What is in it for me But I also know this problem is not going away . By the time I am finished speaking tonight , more Americans will have lost their health insurance . Millions will lose it this year . Our deficit will grow . Premiums will go up . Patients will be denied the care they need . Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether . I will not walk away from these Americans , and neither should the people in this Chamber . So , as temperatures cool , I want everyone to take another look at the plan we have proposed . There is a reason why many doctors , nurses , and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo . But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums , bring down the deficit , cover the uninsured , strengthen Medicare for seniors , and stop insurance company abuses , let me know . Let me know . Let me know . I am eager to see it . Here s what I ask Congress , though Do not walk away from reform . Not now . Not when we are so close . Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . Now , even as health care reform would reduce our deficit , it is not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves . It is a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that is been subject to a lot of political posturing . So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight . At the beginning of the last decade , the year 2000 , America had a budget surplus of over 200 billion . By the time I took office , we had a 1 year deficit of over 1 trillion and projected deficits of 8 trillion over the next decade . Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars , two tax cuts , and an expensive prescription drug program . On top of that , the effects of the recession put a 3 trillion hole in our budget . All this was before I walked in the door . Now just stating the facts . Now , if we had taken office in ordinary times , I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit . But we took office amid a crisis . And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another 1 trillion to our national debt . That too is a fact . I am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do . But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions . The Federal Government should do the same . So tonight I am proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year . Starting in 2011 , we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years . Spending related to our national security , Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security will not be affected . But all other discretionary Government programs will . Like any cash strapped family , we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we do not . And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto , I will . We will continue to go through the budget , line by line , page by page , to eliminate programs that we cannot afford and do not work . We have already identified 20 billion in savings for next year . To help working families , we will extend our middle class tax cuts . But at a time of record deficits , we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies , for investment fund managers , and for those making over 250 , 000 a year . We just cannot afford it . Now , even after paying for what we spent on my watch , we will still face the massive deficit we had when I took office . More importantly , the cost of Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security will continue to skyrocket . That is why I have called for a bipartisan fiscal commission , modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad . This cannot be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem . The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline . Now , yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission , so I will issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward , because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans . And when the vote comes tomorrow , the Senate should restore the pay as you go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s . Now , I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting . And I agree , which is why this freeze will not take effect until next year , when the economy is stronger . That is how budgeting works . But understand , if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our debt , it could damage our markets , increase the cost of borrowing , and jeopardize our recovery , all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes . From some on the right , I expect we will hear a different argument , that if we just make fewer investments in our people , extend tax cuts , including those for the wealthier Americans , eliminate more regulations , maintain the status quo on health care , our deficits will go away . The problem is , that is what we did for 8 years . That is what helped us into this crisis . It is what helped lead to these deficits . We cannot do it again . Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades , it is time to try something new . Let us invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt . Let us meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here . Let us try common sense a novel concept . Now , to do that , we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now . We face a deficit of trust , deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years . To close that credibility gap , we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists , to do our work openly , to give our people the Government they deserve . Now , that is what I came to Washington to do . That is why , for the first time in history , my administration posts on our White House visitors online . That is why we have excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions . But we cannot stop there . It is time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client , with my administration or with Congress . It is time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office . With all due deference to separation of powers , last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations , to spend without limit in our elections . I do not think American elections should be bankrolled by America s most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities . They should be decided by the American people . And I had urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems . I am also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform , Democrats and Republicans Democrats and Republicans . Look , you have trimmed some of this spending , you have embraced some meaningful change , but restoring the public trust demands more . For example , some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online . Tonight I am calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there is a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent . Of course , none of these reforms will even happen if we do not also reform how we work with one another . Now , I am not naive . I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some postpartisan era . I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched . And on some issues , there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways . These disagreements , about the role of government in our lives , about our national priorities and our national security , they have been taking place for over 200 years . They are the very essence of our democracy . But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day . We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side , a belief that if you lose , I win . Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can . The confirmation of I am speaking to both parties now . The confirmation of well qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators . Washington may think that saying anything about the other side , no matter how false , no matter how malicious , is just part of the game . But it is precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people . Worse yet , it is sowing further division among our citizens , further distrust in our Government . So , no , I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics . I know it is an election year . And after last week , it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual . But we still need to govern . To Democrats , I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems , not run for the hills . And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town a supermajority then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well . Just saying no to everything may be good short term politics , but it is not leadership . We were sent here to serve our citizens , not our ambitions . So let us show the American people that we can do it together . This week , I will be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans . I had like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership . I know you cannot wait . Now , throughout our history , no issue has united this country more than our security . Sadly , some of the unity we felt after 9 11 has dissipated . And we can argue all we want about who is to blame for this , but I am not interested in relitigating the past . I know that all of us love this country . All of us are committed to its defense . So let us put aside the schoolyard taunts about who is tough . Let us reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values . Let us leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our Nation and forge a more hopeful future for America and for the world . That is the work we began last year . Since the day I took office , we have renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation . We have made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives . We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack , with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence . We have prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula . And in the last year , hundreds of Al Qaida s fighters and affiliates , including many senior leaders , have been captured or killed , far more than in 2008 . And in Afghanistan , we are increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home . We will reward good governance , work to reduce corruption , and support the rights of all Afghans , men and women alike . We are joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose . There will be difficult days ahead , but I am absolutely confident we will succeed . As we take the fight to Al Qaida , we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people . As a candidate , I promised that I would end this war , and that is what I am doing as President . We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August . We will support the Iraqi Government as they hold elections , and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity . But make no mistake This war is ending , and all of our troops are coming home . Tonight all of our men and women in uniform , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , and around the world , they have to know that we that they have our respect , our gratitude , our full support . And just as they must have the resources they need in war , we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home . That is why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year . That is why we are building a 21st century VAnd that is why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families . Now , even as we prosecute two wars , we are also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people , the threat of nuclear weapons . I have embraced the vision of John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them . To reduce our stockpiles and launchers , while ensuring our deterrent , the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades . And at April s Nuclear Security Summit , we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington , Dbehind a clear goal securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists . Now , these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons . That is why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions , sanctions that are being vigorously enforced . That is why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated . And as Iran s leaders continue to ignore their obligations , there should be no doubt They too will face growing consequences . That is a promise . That is the leadership we are providing engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people . We are working through the G 20 to sustain a lasting global recovery . We are working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation . We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change . We are helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV AIDAnd we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease , a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad . As we have for over 60 years , America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores . But we also do it because it is right . That is why , as we meet here tonight , over 10 , 000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild . That is why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan , why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran , why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea . For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity always . Abroad , America s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals . The same is true at home . We find unity in our incredible diversity , drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution The notion that we are all created equal that no matter who you are or what you look like , if you abide by the law , you should be protected by it if you adhere to our common values , you should be treated no different than anyone else . We must continually renew this promise . My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination . We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate . This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are . It is the right thing to do . We are going to crackdown on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal day s work . And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system , to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our Nation . In the end , it is our ideals , our values that built America , values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe , values that drive our citizens still . Every day , Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers . Time and again , they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country . They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit . These are not Republican values or Democratic values that they are living by , business values or labor values , they are American values . Unfortunately , too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions our corporations , our media , and , yes , our Government still reflect these same values . Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper . But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain , people s doubts grow . Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up , we lose faith . The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments , big issues into sound bites , our citizens turn away . No wonder there is so much cynicism out there . No wonder there is so much disappointment . I campaigned on the promise of change . Change we can believe in , the slogan went . And right now I know there are many Americans who are not sure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it . But remember this I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone . Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated . And when you try to do big things and make big changes , it stirs passions and controversy . That is just how it is . Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers . We can do what is necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election , instead of doing what is best for the next generation . But I also know this If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago , we would not be here tonight . The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard , to do what was needed even when success was uncertain , to do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their children and their grandchildren . Now , our administration has had some political setbacks this year , and some of them were deserved . But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year . And what keeps me going , what keeps me fighting , is that despite all these setbacks , that spirit of determination and optimism , that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people , that lives on . It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company , None of us , he said , . . . are willing to consider , even slightly , that we might fail . It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession , We are strong . We are resilient . We are American . It lives on in the 8 year old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti . And it lives on in all the Americans who have dropped everything to go someplace they have never been and pull people they have never known from the rubble , prompting chants of S . A . S . A . S . A when another life was saved . The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries lives on in you , its people . We have finished a difficult year . We have come through a difficult decade . But a new year has come . A new decade stretches before us . We do not quit . I do not quit . Let us seize this moment to start anew , to carry the dream forward , and to strengthen our Union once more . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Your Majesties , Your Royal Highnesses , distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , citizens of America , and citizens of the world I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility . It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world , we are not mere prisoners of fate . Our actions matter , and can bend history in the direction of justice . And yet I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated . In part , this is because I am at the beginning , and not the end , of my labors on the world stage . Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize Schweitzer and King Marshall and Mandela my accomplishments are slight . And then there are the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics . I cannot argue with those who find these men and women some known , some obscure to all but those they help to be far more deserving of this honor than I . But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander in Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars . One of these wars is winding down . The other is a conflict that America did not seek one in which we are joined by 42 other countries including Norway in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks . Still , we are at war , and I am responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land . Some will kill , and some will be killed . And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace , and our effort to replace one with the other . Now these questions are not new . War , in one form or another , appeared with the first man . At the dawn of history , its morality was not questioned it was simply a fact , like drought or disease the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences . And over time , as codes of law sought to control violence within groups , so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war . The concept of a just war emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met if it is waged as a last resort or in self defense if the force used is proportional and if , whenever possible , civilians are spared from violence . Of course , we know that for most of history , this concept of just war was rarely observed . The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible , as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God . Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred . In the span of 30 years , such carnage would twice engulf this continent . And while it is hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers , World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished . In the wake of such destruction , and with the advent of the nuclear age , it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war . And so , a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace a Marshall Plan and a United Nations , mechanisms to govern the waging of war , treaties to protect human rights , prevent genocide , restrict the most dangerous weapons . In many ways , these efforts succeeded . Yes , terrible wars have been fought , and atrocities committed . But there has been no Third World War . The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall . Commerce has stitched much of the world together . Billions have been lifted from poverty . The ideals of liberty and self determination , equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced . We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past , and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud . And yet , a decade into a new century , this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats . The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers , but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe . Terrorism has long been a tactic , but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale . Moreover , wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations . The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts the growth of secessionist movements , insurgencies , and failed states all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos . In today s wars , many more civilians are killed than soldiers the seeds of future conflict are sown , economies are wrecked , civil societies torn asunder , refugees amassed , children scarred . I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war . What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision , hard work , and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago . And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace . We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes . There will be times when nations acting individually or in concert will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified . I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King said in this same ceremony years ago Violence never brings permanent peace . It solves no social problem it merely creates new and more complicated ones . As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of King s life work , I am living testimony to the moral force of non violence . I know there is nothing weak nothing passive nothing na iuml ve in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King . But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation , I cannot be guided by their examples alone . I face the world as it is , and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people . For make no mistake Evil does exist in the world . A non violent movement could not have halted Hitler s armies . Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda s leaders to lay down their arms . To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism it is a recognition of history the imperfections of man and the limits of reason . I raise this point , I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today , no matter what the cause . And at times , this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America , the world s sole military superpower . But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions not just treaties and declarations that brought stability to a post World War II world . Whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms . The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans . We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will . We have done so out of enlightened self interest because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren , and we believe that their lives will be better if others children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity . So yes , the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace . And yet this truth must coexist with another that no matter how justified , war promises human tragedy . The soldier s courage and sacrifice is full of glory , expressing devotion to country , to cause , to comrades in arms . But war itself is never glorious , and we must never trumpet it as such . So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly inreconcilable truths that war is sometimes necessary , and war at some level is an expression of human folly . Concretely , we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago . Let us focus , he said , on a more practical , more attainable peace , based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions . A gradual evolution of human institutions . What might this evolution look like What might these practical steps be To begin with , I believe that all nations strong and weak alike must adhere to standards that govern the use of force . I like any head of state reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation . Nevertheless , I am convinced that adhering to standards , international standards , strengthens those who do , and isolates and weakens those who do not . The world rallied around America after the 9 11 attacks , and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan , because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self defense . Likewise , the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression . Furthermore , America in fact , no nation can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves . For when we do not , our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions , no matter how justified . And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor . More and more , we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government , or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region . I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war . Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later . That is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace . America s commitment to global security will never waver . But in a world in which threats are more diffuse , and missions more complex , America cannot act alone . America alone cannot secure the peace . This is true in Afghanistan . This is true in failed states like Somalia , where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering . And sadly , it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come . The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries , and other friends and allies , demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they have shown in Afghanistan . But in many countries , there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public . I understand why war is not popular , but I also know this The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it . Peace requires responsibility . Peace entails sacrifice . That is why NATO continues to be indispensable . That is why we must strengthen and regional peacekeeping , and not leave the task to a few countries . That is why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome to Ottawa and Sydney to Dhaka and Kigali we honor them not as makers of war , but of wagers but as wagers of peace . Let me make one final point about the use of force . Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war , we must also think clearly about how we fight it . The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant the founder of the Red Cross , and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions . Where force is necessary , we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct . And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules , I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war . That is what makes us different from those whom we fight . That is a source of our strength . That is why I prohibited torture . That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed . And that is why I have reaffirmed America s commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions . We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend . And we honor we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it is easy , but when it is hard . I have spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war . But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices , and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace . First , in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws , I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior for if we want a lasting peace , then the words of the international community must mean something . Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable . Sanctions must exact a real price . Intransigence must be met with increased pressure and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one . One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , and to seek a world without them . In the middle of the last century , nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear All will have access to peaceful nuclear power those without nuclear weapons will forsake them and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament . I am committed to upholding this treaty . It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy . And I am working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia s nuclear stockpiles . But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system . Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted . Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia . Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war . The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people . When there is genocide in Darfur , systematic rape in Congo , repression in Burma there must be consequences . Yes , there will be engagement yes , there will be diplomacy but there must be consequences when those things fail . And the closer we stand together , the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression . This brings me to a second point the nature of the peace that we seek . For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict . Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting . It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War . In the wake of devastation , they recognized that if human rights are not protected , peace is a hollow promise . And yet too often , these words are ignored . For some countries , the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles , foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation s development . And within America , there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world . I reject these choices . I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please choose their own leaders or assemble without fear . Pent up grievances fester , and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence . We also know that the opposite is true . Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace . America has never fought a war against a democracy , and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens . No matter how callously defined , neither America s interests nor the world s are served by the denial of human aspirations . So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries , America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal . We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran . It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation . And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements these movements of hope and history they have us on their side . Let me also say this The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone . At times , it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy . I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation . But I also know that sanctions without outreach condemnation without discussion can carry forward only a crippling status quo . No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door . In light of the Cultural Revolution s horrors , Nixon s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies . Pope John Paul s engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church , but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa . Ronald Reagan s efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union , but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe . There is no simple formula here . But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement , pressure and incentives , so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time . Third , a just peace includes not only civil and political rights it must encompass economic security and opportunity . For true peace is not just freedom from fear , but freedom from want . It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food , or clean water , or the medicine and shelter they need to survive . It does not exist where children cannot aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family . The absence of hope can rot a society from within . And that is why helping farmers feed their own people or nations educate their children and care for the sick is not mere charity . It is also why the world must come together to confront climate change . There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing , we will face more drought , more famine , more mass displacement all of which will fuel more conflict for decades . For this reason , it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action it is military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance . Agreements among nations . Strong institutions . Support for human rights . Investments in development . All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about . And yet , I do not believe that we will have the will , the determination , the staying power , to complete this work without something more and that is the continued expansion of our moral imagination an insistence that there is something irreducible that we all share . As the world grows smaller , you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are to understand that we are all basically seeking the same things that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families . And yet somehow , given the dizzying pace of globalization , the cultural leveling of modernity , it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities their race , their tribe , and perhaps most powerfully their religion . In some places , this fear has led to conflict . At times , it even feels like we are moving backwards . We see it in the Middle East , as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden . We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines . And most dangerously , we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam , and who attacked my country from Afghanistan . These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded . But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war . For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will , then there is no need for restraint no need to spare the pregnant mother , or the medic , or the Red Cross worker , or even a person of one s own faith . Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace , but I believe it is incompatible with the very purpose of faith for the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us . Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature . For we are fallible . We make mistakes , and fall victim to the temptations of pride , and power , and sometimes evil . Even those of us with the best of intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us . But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected . We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place . The non violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance , but the love that they preached their fundamental faith in human progress that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey . For if we lose that faith if we dismiss it as silly or na iuml ve if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace then we lose what is best about humanity . We lose our sense of possibility . We lose our moral compass . Like generations have before us , we must reject that future . As King said at this occasion so many years ago , I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history . I refuse to accept the idea that the isness of man s present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal oughtness that forever confronts him . Let us reach for the world that ought to be that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls . Somewhere today , in the here and now , in the world as it is , a soldier sees he is outgunned , but stands firm to keep the peace . Somewhere today , in this world , a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government , but has the courage to march on . Somewhere today , a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child , scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child s dreams . Let us live by their example . We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us , and still strive for justice . We can admit the intractability of depravation , and still strive for dignity . Clear eyed , we can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace . We can do that for that is the story of human progress that is the hope of all the world and at this moment of challenge , that must be our work here on Earth . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Good evening . As we speak , our nation faces a multitude of challenges . At home , our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American . Abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists . And tonight , I have returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we are waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens . On April 20th , an explosion ripped through BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana . Eleven workers lost their lives . Seventeen others were injured . And soon , nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean , oil began spewing into the water . Because there has never been a leak this size at this depth , stopping it has tested the limits of human technology . That is why just after the rig sank , I assembled a team of our nation s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge a team led by Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize winning physicist and our nation s Secretary of Energy . Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice . As a result of these efforts , we have directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology . And in the coming weeks and days , these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well . This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . Already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days . The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . But make no mistake We will fight this spill with everything we have got for as long as it takes . We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . And we will do whatever s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . Tonight I had like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward what we are doing to clean up the oil , what we are doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf , and what we are doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again . First , the cleanup . From the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation s history an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen , who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters . We now have nearly 30 , 000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil . Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf . And I have authorized the deployment of over 17 , 000 National Guard members along the coast . These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore , they are ready to help clean the beaches , train response workers , or even help with processing claims and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible . Because of our efforts , millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning , skimming and other collection methods . Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil . We have approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore , and we are working with Alabama , Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines . As the cleanup continues , we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need . Now , a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect , and new challenges will always arise . I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip . So if something is not working , we want to hear about it . If there are problems in the operation , we will fix them . But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts , oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife . And sadly , no matter how effective our response is , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . That is why the second thing we are focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . You know , for generations , men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water . That living is now in jeopardy . I have talked to shrimpers and fishermen who do not know how they are going to support their families this year . I have seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected . I have talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back . The sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money they have lost . It is about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost . I refuse to let that happen . Tomorrow , I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company s recklessness . And this fund will not be controlled by BIn order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner , the account must and will be administered by an independent third party . Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term , it is also clear we need a long term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region . The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that is already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats . And the region still has not recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . That is why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment . I make that commitment tonight . Earlier , I asked Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy , who is also a former governor of Mississippi and a son of the Gulf Coast , to develop a long term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible . The plan will be designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists and other Gulf residents . And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region . The third part of our response plan is the steps we are taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again . A few months ago , I approved a proposal to consider new , limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken . That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig , and I want to know why . The American people deserve to know why . The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion these families deserve to know why . And so I have established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place . Already , I have issued a six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue . And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible , I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially . One place we have already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits , known as the Minerals Management Service . Over the last decade , this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves . At this agency , industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight . Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors , and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations . When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior , one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency . But it is now clear that the problem there ran much deeper , and the pace of reform was just too slow . And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency Michael Bromwich , who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General . And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry s watchdog not its partner . So one of the lessons we have learned from this spill is that we need better regulations , better safety standards , and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling . But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry , drilling for oil these days entails greater risk . After all , oil is a finite resource . We consume more than 20 percent of the world s oil , but have less than 2 percent of the world s oil reserves . And that is part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean because we are running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water . For decades , we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered . For decades , we have talked and talked about the need to end America s century long addiction to fossil fuels . And for decades , we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires . Time and again , the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight . Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America . Each day , we send nearly 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . And today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude . We cannot consign our children to this future . The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now . Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash America s innovation and seize control of our own destiny . This is not some distant vision for America . The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time , but over the last year and a half , we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry . As we speak , old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines , people are going back to work installing energy efficient windows , and small businesses are making solar panels . Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks , and families are making their homes more energy efficient . Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries . Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us . As we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs but only if we accelerate that transition . Only if we seize the moment . And only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs scientists and citizens the public and private sectors . When I was a candidate for this office , I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence . Last year , the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America s businesses . Now , there are costs associated with this transition . And there are some who believe that we cannot afford those costs right now . I say we cannot afford not to change how we produce and use energy because the long term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater . So I am happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels . Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks . Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power . Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high tech industry does on research and development and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development . All of these approaches have merit , and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead . But the one approach I will not accept is inaction . The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet . You know , the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War IThe same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon . And yet , time and again , we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom . Instead , what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny our determination to fight for the America we want for our children . Even if we are unsure exactly what that looks like . Even if we do not yet know precisely how we are going to get there . We know we will get there . It is a faith in the future that sustains us as a people . It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now . Each year , at the beginning of shrimping season , the region s fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe . It is called The Blessing of the Fleet , and today it is a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea some for weeks at a time . The ceremony goes on in good times and in bad . It took place after Katrina , and it took place a few weeks ago at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced . And still , they came and they prayed . For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition , The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers . The blessing is that He is with us always , a blessing that is granted even in the midst of the storm . The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face . This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again . What sees us through what has always seen us through is our strength , our resilience , and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it . Tonight , we pray for that courage . We pray for the people of the Gulf . And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day . Thank you , God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , everybody . As a candidate for President , I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world . After taking office , I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011 . As Commander in Chief , ensuring the success of this strategy has been one of my highest national security priorities . Last year , I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq . And to date , we have removed more than 100 , 000 troops . Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country s security . A few hours ago I spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki . I reaffirmed that the United States keeps its commitments . He spoke of the determination of the Iraqi people to forge their own future . We are in full agreement about how to move forward . So today , I can report that , as promised , the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year . After nearly nine years , America s war in Iraq will be over . Over the next two months , our troops in Iraq tens of thousands of them will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their heads held high , proud of their success , and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops . That is how America s military efforts in Iraq will end . But even as we mark this important milestone , we are also moving into a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Iraq . As of January 1st , and in keeping with our Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq , it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations , an equal partnership based on mutual interests and mutual respect . In today s conversation , Prime Minister Maliki and I agreed that a meeting of the Higher Coordinating Committee of the Strategic Framework Agreement will convene in the coming weeks . And I invited the Prime Minister to come to the White House in December , as we plan for all the important work that we have to do together . This will be a strong and enduring partnership . With our diplomats and civilian advisors in the lead , we will help Iraqis strengthen institutions that are just , representative and accountable . We will build new ties of trade and of commerce , culture and education , that unleash the potential of the Iraqi people . We will partner with an Iraq that contributes to regional security and peace , just as we insist that other nations respect Iraq s sovereignty . As I told Prime Minister Maliki , we will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces again , just as we offer training and assistance to countries around the world . After all , there will be some difficult days ahead for Iraq , and the United States will continue to have an interest in an Iraq that is stable , secure and self reliant . Just as Iraqis have persevered through war , I am confident that they can build a future worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization . Here at home , the coming months will be another season of homecomings . Across America , our servicemen and women will be reunited with their families . Today , I can say that our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays . This December will be a time to reflect on all that we have been though in this war . I will join the American people in paying tribute to the more than 1 million Americans who have served in Iraq . We will honor our many wounded warriors and the nearly 4 , 500 American patriots and their Iraqi and coalition partners who gave their lives to this effort . And finally , I would note that the end of war in Iraq reflects a larger transition . The tide of war is receding . The drawdown in Iraq allowed us to refocus our fight against al Qaeda and achieve major victories against its leadership including Osama bin Laden . Now , even as we remove our last troops from Iraq , we are beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan , where we have begun a transition to Afghan security and leadership . When I took office , roughly 180 , 000 troops were deployed in both these wars . And by the end of this year that number will be cut in half , and make no mistake It will continue to go down . Meanwhile , yesterday marked the definitive end of the Qaddafi regime in Libya . And there , too , our military played a critical role in shaping a situation on the ground in which the Libyan people can build their own future . Today , NATO is working to bring this successful mission to a close . So to sum up , the United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year . The transition in Afghanistan is moving forward , and our troops are finally coming home . As they do , fewer deployments and more time training will help keep our military the very best in the world . And as we welcome home our newest veterans , we will never stop working to give them and their families the care , the benefits and the opportunities that they have earned . This includes enlisting our veterans in the greatest challenge that we now face as a nation creating opportunity and jobs in this country . Because after a decade of war , the nation that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own an America that sees its economic strength restored just as we have restored our leadership around the globe . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . Thank you . My Lord Chancellor , Speaker , Prime Minister , my lords , and members of the House of Commons I have known few greater honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster Hall . I am told that the last three speakers here have been the Pope , Her Majesty the Queen , and Nelson Mandela which is either a very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke . I come here today to reaffirm one of the oldest , one of the strongest alliances the world has ever known . It is long been said that the United States and the United Kingdom share a special relationship . And since we also share an especially active press corps , that relationship is often analyzed and overanalyzed for the slightest hint of stress or strain . Of course , all relationships have their ups and downs . Admittedly , ours got off on the wrong foot with a small scrape about tea and taxes . There may also have been some hurt feelings when the White House was set on fire during the War of 1812 . But fortunately , it is been smooth sailing ever since . The reason for this close friendship does not just have to do with our shared history , our shared heritage our ties of language and culture or even the strong partnership between our governments . Our relationship is special because of the values and beliefs that have united our people through the ages . Centuries ago , when kings , emperors , and warlords reigned over much of the world , it was the English who first spelled out the rights and liberties of man in the Magna Carta . It was here , in this very hall , where the rule of law first developed , courts were established , disputes were settled , and citizens came to petition their leaders . Over time , the people of this nation waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and secure their freedom from the crown . Propelled by the ideals of the Enlightenment , they would ultimately forge an English Bill of Rights , and invest the power to govern in an elected parliament that is gathered here today . What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world . But perhaps no one drew greater inspiration from these notions of freedom than your rabble rousing colonists on the other side of the Atlantic . As Winston Churchill said , the hellip Magna Carta , the Bill of Rights , Habeas Corpus , trial by jury , and English common law find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence . For both of our nations , living up to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has sometimes been difficult , has always been a work in progress . The path has never been perfect . But through the struggles of slaves and immigrants , women and ethnic minorities , former colonies and persecuted religions , we have learned better than most that the longing for freedom and human dignity is not English or American or Western it is universal , and it beats in every heart . Perhaps that is why there are few nations that stand firmer , speak louder , and fight harder to defend democratic values around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom . We are the allies who landed at Omaha and Gold , who sacrificed side by side to free a continent from the march of tyranny , and help prosperity flourish from the ruins of war . And with the founding of NATO a British idea we joined a transatlantic alliance that has ensured our security for over half a century . Together with our allies , we forged a lasting peace from a cold war . When the Iron Curtain lifted , we expanded our alliance to include the nations of Central and Eastern Europe , and built new bridges to Russia and the former states of the Soviet Union . And when there was strife in the Balkans , we worked together to keep the peace . Today , after a difficult decade that began with war and ended in recession , our nations have arrived at a pivotal moment once more . A global economy that once stood on the brink of depression is now stable and recovering . After years of conflict , the United States has removed 100 , 000 troops from Iraq , the United Kingdom has removed its forces , and our combat mission there has ended . In Afghanistan , we have broken the Taliban s momentum and will soon begin a transition to Afghan lead . And nearly 10 years after 9 11 , we have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader Osama bin Laden . Together , we have met great challenges . But as we enter this new chapter in our shared history , profound challenges stretch before us . In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked , a new era of cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy . As new threats spread across borders and oceans , we must dismantle terrorist networks and stop the spread of nuclear weapons , confront climate change and combat famine and disease . And as a revolution races through the streets of the Middle East and North Africa , the entire world has a stake in the aspirations of a generation that longs to determine its own destiny . These challenges come at a time when the international order has already been reshaped for a new century . Countries like China , India , and Brazil are growing by leaps and bounds . We should welcome this development , for it has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty around the globe , and created new markets and opportunities for our own nations . And yet , as this rapid change has taken place , it is become fashionable in some quarters to question whether the rise of these nations will accompany the decline of American and European influence around the world . Perhaps , the argument goes , these nations represent the future , and the time for our leadership has passed . That argument is wrong . The time for our leadership is now . It was the United States and the United Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped a world in which new nations could emerge and individuals could thrive . And even as more nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership , our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more peaceful , more prosperous and more just . At a time when threats and challenges require nations to work in concert with one another , we remain the greatest catalysts for global action . In an era defined by the rapid flow of commerce and information , it is our free market tradition , our openness , fortified by our commitment to basic security for our citizens , that offers the best chance of prosperity that is both strong and shared . As millions are still denied their basic human rights because of who they are , or what they believe , or the kind of government that they live under , we are the nations most willing to stand up for the values of tolerance and self determination that lead to peace and dignity . Now , this does not mean we can afford to stand still . The nature of our leadership will need to change with the times . As I said the first time I came to London as President , for the G20 summit , the days are gone when Roosevelt and Churchill could sit in a room and solve the world s problems over a glass of brandy although I am sure that Prime Minister Cameron would agree that some days we could both use a stiff drink . In this century , our joint leadership will require building new partnerships , adapting to new circumstances , and remaking ourselves to meet the demands of a new era . That begins with our economic leadership . Adam Smith s central insight remains true today There is no greater generator of wealth and innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes the full potential of individual men and women . That is what led to the Industrial Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester . That is what led to the dawn of the Information Age that arose from the office parks of Silicon Valley . That is why countries like China , India and Brazil are growing so rapidly because in fits and starts , they are moving toward market based principles that the United States and the United Kingdom have always embraced . In other words , we live in a global economy that is largely of our own making . And today , the competition for the best jobs and industries favors countries that are free thinking and forward looking countries with the most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizens . That gives nations like the United States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage . For from Newton and Darwin to Edison and Einstein , from Alan Turing to Steve Jobs , we have led the world in our commitment to science and cutting edge research , the discovery of new medicines and technologies . We educate our citizens and train our workers in the best colleges and universities on Earth . But to maintain this advantage in a world that is more competitive than ever , we will have to redouble our investments in science and engineering , and renew our national commitments to educating our workforces . We have also been reminded in the last few years that markets can sometimes fail . In the last century , both our nations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with such market failures safeguards to protect the banking system after the Great Depression , for example regulations that were established to prevent the pollution of our air and water during the 1970s . But in today s economy , such threats of market failure can no longer be contained within the borders of any one country . Market failures can go global , and go viral , and demand international responses . A financial crisis that began on Wall Street infected nearly every continent , which is why we must keep working through forums like the G20 to put in place global rules of the road to prevent future excesses and abuse . No country can hide from the dangers of carbon pollution , which is why we must build on what was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave our children a planet that is safer and cleaner . Moreover , even when the free market works as it should , both our countries recognize that no matter how responsibly we live in our lives , hard times or bad luck , a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of us . And so part of our common tradition has expressed itself in a conviction that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security health care if you get sick , unemployment insurance if you lose your job , a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work . That commitment to our citizens has also been the reason for our leadership in the world . And now , having come through a terrible recession , our challenge is to meet these obligations while ensuring that we are not consuming and hence consumed with a level of debt that could sap the strength and vitality of our economies . And that will require difficult choices and it will require different paths for both of our countries . But we have faced such challenges before , and have always been able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the responsibilities we have to one another . And I believe we can do this again . As we do , the successes and failures of our own past can serve as an example for emerging economies that it is possible to grow without polluting that lasting prosperity comes not from what a nation consumes , but from what it produces , and from the investments it makes in its people and its infrastructure . And just as we must lead on behalf of the prosperity of our citizens , so we must safeguard their security . Our two nations know what it is to confront evil in the world . Hitler s armies would not have stopped their killing had we not fought them on the beaches and on the landing grounds , in the fields and on the streets . We must never forget that there was nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war . It was won through the courage and character of our people . Precisely because we are willing to bear its burden , we know well the cost of war . And that is why we built an alliance that was strong enough to defend this continent while deterring our enemies . At its core , NATO is rooted in the simple concept of Article Five that no NATO nation will have to fend on its own that allies will stand by one another , always . And for six decades , NATO has been the most successful alliance in human history . Today , we confront a different enemy . Terrorists have taken the lives of our citizens in New York and in London . And while al Qaeda seeks a religious war with the West , we must remember that they have killed thousands of Muslims men , women and children around the globe . Our nations are not and will never be at war with Islam . Our fight is focused on defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies . In that effort , we will not relent , as Osama bin Laden and his followers have learned . And as we fight an enemy that respects no law of war , we will continue to hold ourselves to a higher standard by living up to the values , the rule of law and due process that we so ardently defend . For almost a decade , Afghanistan has been a central front of these efforts . Throughout those years , you , the British people , have been a stalwart ally , along with so many others who fight by our side . Together , let us pay tribute to all of our men and women who have served and sacrificed over the last several years for they are part of an unbroken line of heroes who have borne the heaviest burden for the freedoms that we enjoy . Because of them , we have broken the Taliban s momentum . Because of them , we have built the capacity of Afghan security forces . And because of them , we are now preparing to turn a corner in Afghanistan by transitioning to Afghan lead . And during this transition , we will pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of al Qaeda and respect the Afghan constitution and lay down arms . And we will ensure that Afghanistan is never a safe haven for terror , but is instead a country that is strong , sovereign , and able to stand on its own two feet . Indeed , our efforts in this young century have led us to a new concept for NATO that will give us the capabilities needed to meet new threats threats like terrorism and piracy , cyber attacks and ballistic missiles . But a revitalized NATO will continue to hew to that original vision of its founders , allowing us to rally collective action for the defense of our people , while building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt and Churchill that all nations have both rights and responsibilities , and all nations share a common interest in an international architecture that maintains the peace . We also share a common interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons . Across the globe , nations are locking down nuclear materials so they never fall into the wrong hands because of our leadership . From North Korea to Iran , we have sent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will face consequences which is why America and the European Union just recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran , in large part because of the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States . And while we hold others to account , we will meet our own obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty , and strive for a world without nuclear weapons . We share a common interest in resolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear whole regions asunder . In Sudan , after years of war and thousands of deaths , we call on both North and South to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace . And in the Middle East , we stand united in our support for a secure Israel and a sovereign Palestine . And we share a common interest in development that advances dignity and security . To succeed , we must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of the globe as a place for charity . Instead , we should empower the same forces that have allowed our own people to thrive We should help the hungry to feed themselves , the doctors who care for the sick . We should support countries that confront corruption , and allow their people to innovate . And we should advance the truth that nations prosper when they allow women and girls to reach their full potential . We do these things because we believe not simply in the rights of nations we believe in the rights of citizens . That is the beacon that guided us through our fight against fascism and our twilight struggle against communism . And today , that idea is being put to the test in the Middle East and North Africa . In country after country , people are mobilizing to free themselves from the grip of an iron fist . And while these movements for change are just six months old , we have seen them play out before from Eastern Europe to the Americas , from South Africa to Southeast Asia . History tells us that democracy is not easy . It will be years before these revolutions reach their conclusion , and there will be difficult days along the way . Power rarely gives up without a fight particularly in places where there are divisions of tribe and divisions of sect . We also know that populism can take dangerous turns from the extremism of those who would use democracy to deny minority rights , to the nationalism that left so many scars on this continent in the 20th century . But make no mistake What we saw , what we are seeing in Tehran , in Tunis , in Tahrir Square , is a longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted here at home . It was a rejection of the notion that people in certain parts of the world do not want to be free , or need to have democracy imposed upon them . It was a rebuke to the worldview of al Qaeda , which smothers the rights of individuals , and would thereby subject them to perpetual poverty and violence . Let there be no doubt The United States and United Kingdom stand squarely on the side of those who long to be free . And now , we must show that we will back up those words with deeds . That means investing in the future of those nations that transition to democracy , starting with Tunisia and Egypt by deepening ties of trade and commerce by helping them demonstrate that freedom brings prosperity . And that means standing up for universal rights by sanctioning those who pursue repression , strengthening civil society , supporting the rights of minorities . We do this knowing that the West must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the Middle East and North Africa a mistrust that is rooted in a difficult past . For years , we have faced charges of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedoms that they hear us espouse . And so to them , we must squarely acknowledge that , yes , we have enduring interests in the region to fight terror , sometimes with partners who may not be perfect to protect against disruptions of the world s energy supply . But we must also insist that we reject as false the choice between our interests and our ideals between stability and democracy . For our idealism is rooted in the realities of history that repression offers only the false promise of stability , that societies are more successful when their citizens are free , and that democracies are the closest allies we have . It is that truth that guides our action in Libya . It would have been easy at the outset of the crackdown in Libya to say that none of this was our business that a nation s sovereignty is more important than the slaughter of civilians within its borders . That argument carries weight with some . But we are different . We embrace a broader responsibility . And while we cannot stop every injustice , there are circumstances that cut through our caution when a leader is threatening to massacre his people , and the international community is calling for action . That is why we stopped a massacre in Libya . And we will not relent until the people of Libya are protected and the shadow of tyranny is lifted . We will proceed with humility , and the knowledge that we cannot dictate every outcome abroad . Ultimately , freedom must be won by the people themselves , not imposed from without . But we can and must stand with those who so struggle . Because we have always believed that the future of our children and grandchildren will be better if other people s children and grandchildren are more prosperous and more free from the beaches of Normandy to the Balkans to Benghazi . That is our interests and our ideals . And if we fail to meet that responsibility , who would take our place , and what kind of world would we pass on Our action our leadership is essential to the cause of human dignity . And so we must act and lead with confidence in our ideals , and an abiding faith in the character of our people , who sent us all here today . For there is one final quality that I believe makes the United States and the United Kingdom indispensable to this moment in history . And that is how we define ourselves as nations . Unlike most countries in the world , we do not define citizenship based on race or ethnicity . Being American or British is not about belonging to a certain group it is about believing in a certain set of ideals the rights of individuals , the rule of law . That is why we hold incredible diversity within our borders . That is why there are people around the world right now who believe that if they come to America , if they come to New York , if they come to London , if they work hard , they can pledge allegiance to our flag and call themselves Americans if they come to England , they can make a new life for themselves and can sing God Save The Queen just like any other citizen . Yes , our diversity can lead to tension . And throughout our history there have been heated debates about immigration and assimilation in both of our countries . But even as these debates can be difficult , we fundamentally recognize that our patchwork heritage is an enormous strength that in a world which will only grow smaller and more interconnected , the example of our two nations says it is possible for people to be united by their ideals , instead of divided by their differences that it is possible for hearts to change and old hatreds to pass that it is possible for the sons and daughters of former colonies to sit here as members of this great Parliament , and for the grandson of a Kenyan who served as a cook in the British Army to stand before you as President of the United States . That is what defines us . That is why the young men and women in the streets of Damascus and Cairo still reach for the rights our citizens enjoy , even if they sometimes differ with our policies . As two of the most powerful nations in the history of the world , we must always remember that the true source of our influence has not just been the size of our economies , or the reach of our militaries , or the land that we have claimed . It has been the values that we must never waver in defending around the world the idea that all beings are endowed by our Creator with certain rights that cannot be denied . That is what forged our bond in the fire of war a bond made manifest by the friendship between two of our greatest leaders . Churchill and Roosevelt had their differences . They were keen observers of each other s blind spots and shortcomings , if not always their own , and they were hard headed about their ability to remake the world . But what joined the fates of these two men at that particular moment in history was not simply a shared interest in victory on the battlefield . It was a shared belief in the ultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity a conviction that we have a say in how this story ends . This conviction lives on in their people today . The challenges we face are great . The work before us is hard . But we have come through a difficult decade , and whenever the tests and trials ahead may seem too big or too many , let us turn to their example , and the words that Churchill spoke on the day that Europe was freed In the long years to come , not only will the people of this island but hellip the world , wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human heart , look back to what we have done , and they will say do not despair , do not yield hellip march straightforward . With courage and purpose , with humility and with hope , with faith in the promise of tomorrow , let us march straightforward together , enduring allies in the cause of a world that is more peaceful , more prosperous , and more just . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Tonight , more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny , the task of perfecting our union moves forward . It moves forward because of you . It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams , we are an American family , and we rise or fall together , as one nation , and as one people . Tonight , in this election , you , the American people , reminded us that while our road has been hard , while our journey has been long , we have picked ourselves up , we have fought our way back , and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America , the best is yet to come . I want to thank every American who participated in this election . Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way , we have to fix that . Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign , you made your voice heard , and you made a difference . I just spoke with Governor Romney , and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign . We may have battled fiercely , but it is only because we love this country deeply , and we care so strongly about its future . From George to Lenore to their son Mitt , the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service , and that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight . In the weeks ahead , I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward . I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years , America s happy warrior the best Vice President anybody could ever hope for Joe Biden . And I would not be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago . Let me say this publicly Michelle , I have never loved you more . I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you , too , as our nation s First Lady . Sasha and Malia , before our very eyes , you are growing up to become two strong , smart , beautiful young women , just like your mom . And I am so proud of you guys . But I will say that for now , one dog is probably enough . To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best . The best ever . Some of you were new this time around , and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning . But all of you are family . No matter what you do or where you go from here , you will carry the memory of the history we made together , and you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful President . Thank you for believing all the way , through every hill , through every valley . You lifted me up the whole way . And I will always be grateful for everything that you have done and all the incredible work that you put in . I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small , even silly . And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos , or the domain of special interests . But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies , and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym , or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home , you will discover something else . You will hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who is worked his way through college , and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity . You will hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who is going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift . You will hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who is working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job , or a roof over their head when they come home . That is why we do this . That is what politics can be . That is why elections matter . It is not small it is big . It is important . Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated . We have our own opinions . Each of us has deeply held beliefs . And when we go through tough times , when we make big decisions as a country , it necessarily stirs passions , stirs up controversy . That will not change after tonight and it should not . These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty , and we can never forget that as we speak , people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter , the chance to cast their ballots like we did today . But despite all our differences , most of us share certain hopes for America s future . We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation , with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow . We want our children to live in an America that is not burdened by debt that is not weakened by inequality that is not threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet . We want to pass on a country that is safe and respected and admired around the world a nation that is defended by the strongest military on Earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being . We believe in a generous America in a compassionate America in a tolerant America , open to the dreams of an immigrant s daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag . To the young boy on the South Side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner . To the furniture worker s child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist , an engineer or entrepreneur , a diplomat or even a President . That is the future we hope for . That is the vision we share . That is where we need to go . Forward . That is where we need to go . Now , we will disagree , sometimes fiercely , about how to get there . As it has for more than two centuries , progress will come in fits and starts . It is not always a straight line . It is not always a smooth path . By itself , the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams will not end all the gridlock , or solve all our problems , or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus , and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward . But that common bond is where we must begin . Our economy is recovering . A decade of war is ending . A long campaign is now over . And whether I earned your vote or not , I have listened to you . I have learned from you . And you have made me a better President . With your stories and your struggles , I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do , and the future that lies ahead . Tonight , you voted for action , not politics as usual . You elected us to focus on your jobs , not ours . And in the coming weeks and months , I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit reforming our tax code fixing our immigration system freeing ourselves from foreign oil . We have got more work to do . But that does not mean your work is done . The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with your vote . America has never been about what can be done for us . It is about what can be done by us , together , through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government . That is the principle we were founded on . This country has more wealth than any nation , but that is not what makes us rich . We have the most powerful military in history , but that is not what makes us strong . Our university , culture are the envy of the world , but that is not what keeps the world coming to our shores . What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another , and to future generations that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights , and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism . That is what makes America great . I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America . I have seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors , and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job . I have seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb , and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them , watching their back . I have seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York , where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm . And I saw it just the other day in Mentor , Ohio , where a father told the story of his eight year old daughter , whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything , had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care . I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father , but meet this incredible daughter of his . And when he spoke to the crowd , listening to that father s story , every parent in that room had tears in their eyes , because we knew that little girl could be our own . And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright . That is who we are . That is the country I am so proud to lead as your President . And tonight , despite all the hardship we have been through , despite all the frustrations of Washington , I have never been more hopeful about our future . I have never been more hopeful about America . And I ask you to sustain that hope . I am not talking about blind optimism the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path . I am not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight . I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists , despite all the evidence to the contrary , that something better awaits us , so long as we have the courage to keep reaching , to keep working , to keep fighting . America , I believe we can build on the progress we have made , and continue to fight for new jobs , and new opportunity , and new security for the middle class . I believe we can keep the promise of our founding the idea that if you are willing to work hard , it does not matter who you are , or where you come from , or what you look like , or where you love it does not matter whether you are black or white , or Hispanic or Asian , or Native American , or young or old , or rich or poor , abled , disabled , gay or straight you can make it here in America if you are willing to try . I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggest we are not as cynical as the pundits believe we are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states . We are , and forever will be , the United States of America . And together , with your help , and God s grace , we will continue our journey forward , and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth . Thank you , America . God bless you . God bless these United States .<speech_sep>Hello , Connecticut . Thank you . Well , thank you so much , everybody . Let me begin by thanking Nicole , and Ian , for your brave words . I want to thank them and all the Newtown families who have come here today , including your First Selectman , Pat Llodra . Nobody could be more eloquent than Nicole and the other families on this issue . And we are so grateful for their courage and willingness to share their stories again and again , understanding that nothing is going to be more important in making sure the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them . I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well the survivors THE PRESIDENT I love you back . I do . the survivors who still mourn and grieve , but are still going to work every day to love and raise those precious children in their care as fiercely as ever . I want to thank Governor Malloy for his leadership . Very proud of him . I want to thank the University of Hartford for hosting us this afternoon . Thank you , Hawks . And I want to thank the people of Connecticut for everything you have done to honor the memories of the victims because you are part of their family as well . One of your recent alumni , Rachel D Avino , was a behavioral therapist at Sandy Hook . Two alumni of your performing arts school , Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez Greene , lost their daughter , Ana an incredible , vibrant young girl who looked up to them , and learned from them , and inherited their talents by singing before she could talk . So every family in this state was shaken by the tragedy of that morning . Every family in this country was shaken . We hugged our kids more tightly . We asked what could we do , as a society , to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again . And as a society , we decided that we have to change . We must . We must change . I noticed that Nicole and others refer to that day as 12 14 . For these families , it was a day that changed everything . And I know many of you in Newtown wondered if the rest of us would live up to the promise we made in those dark days if we had change , too or if once the television trucks left , once the candles flickered out , once the teddy bears were carefully gathered up , that the country would somehow move on to other things . Over the weekend , I heard Francine Wheeler , who lost her son Ben that day , say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some , but for her , it feels like it is been years since she saw Ben . And she is determined not to let what happened that day just fade away . We are not going anywhere , she said . We are here . And we are going to be here . And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown , everybody who was impacted . And , Newtown , we want you to know that we are here with you . We will not walk away from the promises we have made . We are as determined as ever to do what must be done . In fact , I am here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done . We are not forgetting . We cannot forget . Your families still grieve in ways most of us cannot comprehend . But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference not just to honor your own children , but to protect the lives of all of our children . So many of you have mobilized , and organized , and petitioned your elected officials with love and logic , as Nicole put it as citizens determined to right something gone wrong . And last week , here in Connecticut , your elected leaders responded . The Connecticut legislature , led by many of the legislators here today , passed new measures to protect more of our children and our communities from gun violence . And Governor Malloy signed that legislation into law . So I want to be clear . You , the families of Newtown , people across Connecticut , you helped make that happen . Your voices , your determination made that happen . Obviously , the elected leaders did an extraordinary job moving it forward , but it could not have happened if they were not hearing from people in their respective districts , people all across the state . That is the power of your voice . And , by the way , Connecticut is not alone . In the past few months , New York , Colorado , Maryland have all passed new , common sense gun safety reforms as well . These are all states that share an awful familiarity with gun violence , whether it is the horror of mass killings , or the street crime that is too common in too many neighborhoods . All of these states also share a strong tradition of hunting , and sport shooting , and gun ownership . It is been a part of the fabric of people s lives for generations . And every single one of those states including here in Connecticut decided that , yes , we can protect more of our citizens from gun violence while still protecting our Second Amendment rights . Those two things do not contradict each other . We can pass common sense laws that protect our kids and protect our rights . So Connecticut has shown the way . And now is the time for Congress to do the same . Now is the time for Congress to do the same . This week is the time for Congress to do the same . Now , back in January , just a few months after the tragedy in Newtown , I announced a series of executive actions to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe . And I put forward common sense proposals much like those that passed here in Connecticut for Congress to consider . And you will remember in my State of the Union address , I urged Congress to give those proposals a vote . And that moment is now . As soon as this week , Congress will begin debating these common sense proposals to reduce gun violence . Your senators , Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy they are here your Representatives , John Larson , Rosa DeLauro , Elizabeth Esty , Jim Hines , Joe Courtney , they are all pushing to pass this legislation . But much of Congress is going to only act if they hear from you , the American people . So here s what we have to do . I appreciate that . Here s what we have got to do . We have to tell Congress it is time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others cannot get their hands on a gun . Let us make that happen . We have to tell Congress it is time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folks will think twice before buying a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who will not pass a background check . Let us get that done . We have to tell Congress it is time to restore the ban on military style assault weapons , and a 10 round limit for magazines , to make it harder for a gunman to fire 154 bullets into his victims in less than five minutes . Let us put that to a vote . We have to tell Congress it is time to strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment they need before it is too late . Let us do that for our kids and for our communities . Now , I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others , but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people . All of them are common sense . All of them deserve a vote . All of them deserve a vote . Consider background checks . Over the past 20 years , background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun . A group of police officers in Colorado told me last week that , thanks to background checks , they have been able to stop convicted murderers , folks under restraining orders for committing violent domestic abuse from buying a gun . In some cases , they have actually arrested the person as they were coming to purchase the gun . So we know that background checks can work . But the problem is loopholes in the current law let so many people avoid background checks altogether . That is not safe . It does not make sense . If you are a law abiding citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun , would not you expect other people to play by the same rules If you are a law abiding gun seller , would not you want to know you are not selling your gun to someone who is likely to commit a crime Should not we make it harder , not easier for somebody who is convicted of domestic abuse to get his hands on a gun It turns out 90 percent of Americans think so . Ninety percent of Americans support universal background checks . Think about that . How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything And yet , 90 percent agree on this Republicans , Democrats , folks who own guns , folks who do not own guns 80 percent of Republicans , more than 80 percent of gun owners , more than 70 percent of NRA households . It is common sense . And yet , there is only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on , and that is politics in Washington . You would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to make this happen . That is what you would think . If our democracy is working the way it is supposed to , and 90 percent of the American people agree on something , in the wake of a tragedy you had think this would not be a heavy lift . And yet , some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms . Think about that . They are not just saying they will vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support . They are saying they will do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions . They are saying your opinion does not matter . And that is not right . That is not right . We need a vote . We need a vote . Now , I have also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me . Connecticut , this is not about me . This is not about politics . This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence . It is about them and all the families going forward , so we can prevent this from happening again . That is what it is about . It is about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk . That is what this is about . This is not about politics . This is not about politics . This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let us make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down . When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote that families of Newtown , and Aurora , and Tucson , and a former member of Congress , Gabby Giffords , that they all deserved a vote virtually every member of that chamber stood up and applauded . And now they are going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do You deserve better than that . You deserve a vote . Now , look , we knew from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy . We knew that there would be powerful interests that are very good at confusing the subject , that are good at amplifying conflict and extremes , that are good at drowning out rational debate , good at ginning up irrational fears , all of which stands in the way of progress . But if our history teaches us anything , then it is up to us the people to stand up to those who say we cannot , or we will not stand up for the change that we need . And I believe that that is what the American people are looking for . When I first ran for this office , I said that I did not believe the country was as divided as our politics would suggest , and I still believe that . I know sometimes , when you watch cable news or talk radio , or you browse the Internet , you had think , man , everybody just hates each other , everybody is just at each other s throats . But that is not how most Americans think about these issues . There are good people on both sides of every issue . So if we are going to move forward , we cannot just talk past one another . We have got to listen to one another . That is what Governor Malloy and all these legislative leaders did . That is why they were able to pass bipartisan legislation . I have got stacks of letters from gun owners who want me to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arms , do not want them infringed upon , and I appreciate every one of those letters . I have learned from them . But a lot of those letters , what they have also said is they are not just gun owners they are also parents or police officers or veterans , and they agree that we cannot stand by and keep letting these tragedies happen that with our rights come some responsibilities and obligations to our communities and ourselves , and most of all to our children . We cannot just think about us we have got to think about we , the people . I was in Colorado . I told a story about Michelle . She came back from a trip to rural Iowa we were out there campaigning . Sometimes it would be miles between farms , let alone towns . And she said , you know , coming back , I can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection . If somebody drove up into the driveway and , Barack , you were not home , the sheriff lived miles away , I might want that security . So she can understand what it might be like in terms of somebody wanting that kind of security . On the other hand , I also talked to a hunter last week who said , all my experiences with guns have been positive , but I also realize that for others , all their experiences with guns have been negative . And when he said that , I thought about the mom I met from suburban Chicago whose son was killed in a random shooting . And this mom told me , I hate it when people tell me that my son was in the wrong place at the wrong time . He was on his way to school . He was exactly where he was supposed to be . He was in the right place at the right time , and he still got shot . The kids at Sandy Hook were where they were supposed to be . So were those moviegoers in Aurora . So were those worshippers in Oak Creek . So was Gabby Giffords . She was at a supermarket , listening to the concerns of her constituents . They were exactly where they were supposed to be . They were also exercising their rights to assemble peaceably to worship freely and safely . They were exercising the rights of life and liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . So surely , we can reconcile those two things . Surely , America does not have to be divided between rural and urban , and Democrat and Republican when it comes to something like this . If you are an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known , then we have to act . Now is the time to get engaged . Now is the time to get involved . Now is the time to push back on fear , and frustration , and misinformation . Now is the time for everybody to make their voices heard from every state house to the corridors of Congress . And I am asking everyone listening today , find out where your member of Congress stands on this . If they are not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks , then ask them , why not Why would not you want to make it easier for law enforcement to do their job Why would not you want to make it harder for a dangerous person to get his or her hands on a gun What is more important to you our children , or an A grade from the gun lobby I have heard Nicole talk about what her life has been like since Dylan was taken from her in December . And one thing she said struck me . She said , Every night , I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again . And during the day , I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change . Now , if Nicole can summon the courage to do that , how can the rest of us do any less How can we do any less If there is even one thing we can do to protect our kids , do not we have an obligation to try If there is even one step we can take to keep somebody from murdering dozens of innocents in the span of minutes , should not we be taking that step If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child , is not that worth fighting for I have got to tell you , I have had tough days in the presidency I have said this before . The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my presidency . But I have got to tell you , if we do not respond to this , that will be a tough day for me , too . Because we have got to expect more from ourselves , and we have got to expect more from Congress . We have got to believe that every once in a while , we set politics aside and we just do what is right . We have got to believe that . And if you believe that , I am asking you to stand up . If you believe in the right to bears arms , like I do , but think we should prevent an irresponsible few from inflicting harm stand up . Stand up . If you believe that the families of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Virginia Tech and the thousands of Americans who have been gunned down in the last four months deserve a vote , we all have to stand up . If you want the people you send to Washington to have just an iota of the courage that the educators at Sandy Hook showed when danger arrived on their doorstep , then we are all going to have to stand up . And if we do , if we come together and raise our voices together and demand this change together , I am convinced cooperation and common sense will prevail . We will find sensible , intelligent ways to make this country stronger and safer for our children . So let us do the right thing . Let us do right by our kids . Let us do right by these families . Let us get this done . Connecticut , thank you . God bless you . God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans Today in America , a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it , and did her part to lift America s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades . An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup , and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years . An autoworker fine tuned some of the best , most fuel efficient cars in the world , and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil . A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five year stretch of farm exports in our history . A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford . A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift , bone tired but dreaming big dreams for his son . And in tight knit communities across America , fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids , put an arm around their spouse , remember fallen comrades , and give thanks for being home from a war that , after twelve long years , is finally coming to an end . Tonight , this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you , our citizens , who make the state of our union strong . Here are the results of your efforts The lowest unemployment rate in over five years . A rebounding housing market . A manufacturing sector that is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s . More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time that is happened in nearly twenty years . Our deficits cut by more than half . And for the first time in over a decade , business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world s number one place to invest America is . That is why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America . After five years of grit and determined effort , the United States is better positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth . The question for everyone in this chamber , running through every decision we make this year , is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress . For several years now , this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government . It is an important debate one that dates back to our very founding . But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States then we are not doing right by the American people . As President , I am committed to making Washington work better , and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here . I believe most of you are , too . Last month , thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans , this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year s severe cuts to priorities like education . Nobody got everything they wanted , and we can still do more to invest in this country s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way . But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs , not creating new crises . In the coming months , let us see where else we can make progress together . Let us make this a year of action . That is what most Americans want for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations . And what I believe unites the people of this nation , regardless of race or region or party , young or old , rich or poor , is the simple , profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility , you can get ahead . Let us face it that belief has suffered some serious blows . Over more than three decades , even before the Great Recession hit , massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good , middle class jobs , and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on . Today , after four years of economic growth , corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher , and those at the top have never done better . But average wages have barely budged . Inequality has deepened . Upward mobility has stalled . The cold , hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery , too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by let alone get ahead . And too many still are not working at all . Our job is to reverse these trends . It will not happen right away , and we will not agree on everything . But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete , practical proposals to speed up growth , strengthen the middle class , and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class . Some require Congressional action , and I am eager to work with all of you . But America does not stand still and neither will So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families , that is what I am going to do . As usual , our First Lady sets a good example . Michelle s Let us Move partnership with schools , businesses , and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come . The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400 , 000 veterans and military spouses . Taking a page from that playbook , the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already , 150 universities , businesses , and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus . Across the country , we are partnering with mayors , governors , and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality . The point is , there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments , and are moving this country forward . They believe , and I believe , that here in America , our success should depend not on accident of birth , but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams . That is what drew our forebears here . It is how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America s largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth . Opportunity is who we are . And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise . We know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job . With the economy picking up speed , companies say they intend to hire more people this year . And over half of big manufacturers say they are thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad . So let us make that decision easier for more companies . Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful , complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here , and reward companies that keep profits abroad . Let us flip that equation . Let us work together to close those loopholes , end those incentives to ship jobs overseas , and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home . Moreover , we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads , upgrading our ports , unclogging our commutes because in today s global economy , first class jobs gravitate to first class infrastructure . We will need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer . But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects , so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible . We also have the chance , right now , to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high tech manufacturing jobs . My administration has launched two hubs for high tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown , where we have connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies . Tonight , I am announcing we will launch six more this year . Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create . So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work . Let us do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America . Over the past five years , my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other . And when ninety eight percent of our exporters are small businesses , new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia Pacific will help them create more jobs . We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers , protect our environment , and open new markets to new goods stamped Made in the USA . China and Europe are not standing on the sidelines . Neither should we . We know that the nation that goes all in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow . This is an edge America cannot surrender . Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones . That is why Congress should undo the damage done by last year s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery whether it is vaccines that stay ahead of drug resistant bacteria , or paper thin material that is stronger than steel . And let us pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation , not costly , needless litigation . Now , one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy . The all of the above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working , and today , America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades . One of the reasons why is natural gas if extracted safely , it is the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change . Businesses plan to invest almost 100 billion in new factories that use natural gas . I will cut red tape to help states get those factories built , and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas . My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air , our water , and our communities . And while we are at it , I will use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations . It is not just oil and natural gas production that is booming we are becoming a global leader in solar , too . Every four minutes , another American home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be outsourced . Let us continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving 4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that do not need it , so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do . And even as we have increased energy production , we have partnered with businesses , builders , and local communities to reduce the energy we consume . When we rescued our automakers , for example , we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars . In the coming months , I will build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks , so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump . Taken together , our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner , safer planet . Over the past eight years , the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth . But we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought , and coastal cities dealing with floods . That is why I directed my administration to work with states , utilities , and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air . The shift to a cleaner energy economy will not happen overnight , and it will require tough choices along the way . But the debate is settled . Climate change is a fact . And when our children s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer , more stable world , with new sources of energy , I want us to be able to sayyes , we did . Finally , if we are serious about economic growth , it is time to heed the call of business leaders , labor leaders , faith leaders , and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted . I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same . Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades . And for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreams to study , invent , and contribute to our culture they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone . So let us get immigration reform done this year . The ideas I have outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs . But in this rapidly changing economy , we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs . The good news is , we know how to do it . Two years ago , as the auto industry came roaring back , Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit . She knew that Ford needed parts for the best selling truck in America , and she knew how to make them . She just needed the workforce . So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job , or better job . She was flooded with new workers . And today , Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees . What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker . So tonight , I have asked Vice President Biden to lead an across the board reform of America s training programs to make sure they have one mission train Americans with the skills employers need , and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now . That means more on the job training , and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life . It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs . And if Congress wants to help , you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready to work Americans with ready to be filled jobs . I am also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it is more effective in today s economy . But first , this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1 . 6 million people . Let me tell you why . Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys . She had been steadily employed since she was a teenager . She put herself through college . She had never collected unemployment benefits . In May , she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home . A week later , budget cuts claimed the job she loved . Last month , when their unemployment insurance was cut off , she sat down and wrote me a letter the kind I get every day . We are the face of the unemployment crisis , she wrote . I am not dependent on the government hellip Our country depends on people like us who build careers , contribute to society hellip care about our neighbors hellip I am confident that in time I will find a job hellip I will pay my taxes , and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love . Please give us this chance . Congress , give these hardworking , responsible Americans that chance . They need our help , but more important , this country needs them in the game . That is why I have been asking CEOs to give more long term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week , many will come to the White House to make that commitment real . Tonight , I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same because we are stronger when America fields a full team . Of course , it is not enough to train today s workforce . We also have to prepare tomorrow s workforce , by guaranteeing every child access to a world class education . Estiven Rodriguez could not speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine . But last month , thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program , he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office , where they mailed off their college applications . And this son of a factory worker just found out he is going to college this fall . Five years ago , we set out to change the odds for all our kids . We worked with lenders to reform student loans , and today , more young people are earning college degrees than ever before . Race to the Top , with the help of governors from both parties , has helped states raise expectations and performance . Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington , are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy problem solving , critical thinking , science , technology , engineering , and math . Some of this change is hard . It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think , not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test . But it is worth it and it is working . The problem is we are still not reaching enough kids , and we are not reaching them in time . That has to change . Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child s life is high quality early education . Last year , I asked this Congress to help states make high quality pre K available to every four year old . As a parent as well as a President , I repeat that request tonight . But in the meantime , thirty states have raised pre k funding on their own . They know we cannot wait . So just as we worked with states to reform our schools , this year , we will invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children . And as Congress decides what it is going to do , I am going to pull together a coalition of elected officials , business leaders , and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high quality pre K they need . Last year , I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high speed broadband over the next four years . Tonight , I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple , Microsoft , Sprint , and Verizon , we have got a down payment to start connecting more than 15 , 000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years , without adding a dime to the deficit . We are working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real world education and hands on training that can lead directly to a job and career . We are shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information , and colleges more incentives to offer better value , so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college education . We are offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income , and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt . And I am reaching out to some of America s leading foundations and corporations ona new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential . The bottom line is , Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us . But we know our opportunity agenda will not be complete and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work , and hard work pays off for every single American . Today , women make up about half our workforce . But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns . That is wrong , and in 2014 , it is an embarrassment . A woman deserves equal pay for equal work . She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job . A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship and you know what , a father does , too . It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode . This year , let us all come together Congress , the White House , and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street to give every woman the opportunity she deserves . Because I firmly believe when women succeed , America succeeds . Now , women hold a majority of lower wage jobs but they are not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages . Americans understand that some people will earn more than others , and we do not resent those who , by virtue of their efforts , achieve incredible success . But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty . In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage , five states have passed laws to raise theirs . Many businesses have done it on their own . Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss , John Soranno . John s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis , and Nick helps make the dough . Only now he makes more of it John just gave his employees a raise , to ten bucks an hour a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale . Tonight , I ask more of America s business leaders to follow John s lead and do what you can to raise your employees wages . To every mayor , governor , and state legislator in America , I say , you do not have to wait for Congress to act Americans will support you if you take this on . And as a chief executive , I intend to lead by example . Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover . We should too . In the coming weeks , I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 . 10 an hour because if you cook our troops meals or wash their dishes , you should not have to live in poverty . Of course , to reach millions more , Congress needs to get on board . Today , the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here . Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 . 10 . This will help families . It will give businesses customers with more money to spend . It does not involve any new bureaucratic program . So join the rest of the country . Say yes . Give America a raise . There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet , and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit . Right now , it helps about half of all parents at some point . But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it does not do enough for single workers who do not have kids . So let us work together to strengthen the credit , reward work , and help more Americans get ahead . Let us do more to help Americans save for retirement . Today , most workers do not have a pension . A Social Security check often is not enough on its own . And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years , that does not help folks who do not have 401ks . That is why , tomorrow , I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings MyRIt is a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg . MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in . And if this Congress wants to help , work with me to fix an upside down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save , but does little to nothing for middle class Americans . Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job , so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can . And since the most important investment many families make is their home , send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again , and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans . One last point on financial security . For decades , few things exposed hard working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system . And in case you have not heard , we are in the process of fixing that . A pre existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley , a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona , could not get health insurance . But on January 1st , she got covered . On January 3rd , she felt a sharp pain . On January 6th , she had emergency surgery . Just one week earlier , Amanda said , that surgery would have meant bankruptcy . That is what health insurance reform is all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes , you do not have to lose everything . Already , because of the Affordable Care Act , more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents plans . More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage . And here s another number zero . Because of this law , no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma , back pain , or cancer . No woman can ever be charged more just because she is a woman . And we did all this while adding years to Medicare s finances , keeping Medicare premiums flat , and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors . Now , I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law . But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles . So again , if you have specific plans to cut costs , cover more people , and increase choice tell America what you had do differently . Let us see if the numbers add up . But let us not have another forty something votes to repeal a law that is already helping millions of Americans like Amanda . The first forty were plenty . We got it . We all owe it to the American people to say what we are for , not just what we are against . And if you want to know the real impact this law is having , just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky , who is here tonight . Kentucky s not the most liberal part of the country , but he is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth s families . They are our friends and neighbors , he said . They are people we shop and go to church with hellip farmers out on the tractors hellip grocery clerks hellip they are people who go to work every morning praying they do not get sick . No one deserves to live that way . Steve s right . That is why , tonight , I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st . Moms , get on your kids to sign up . Kids , call your mom and walk her through the application . It will give her some peace of mind plus , she will appreciate hearing from you . After all , that is the spirit that has always moved this nation forward . It is the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility , we can pursue our individual dreams , but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well . Citizenship means standing up for everyone s right to vote . Last year , part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened . But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote . Let us support these efforts . It should be the power of our vote , not the size of our bank account , that drives our democracy . Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day . I have seen the courage of parents , students , pastors , and police officers all over this country who say we are not afraid , and I intend to keep trying , with or without Congress , to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters , shopping malls , or schools like Sandy Hook . Citizenship demands a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self government an obligation to serve to our communities . And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces . Tonight , because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free , the United States is more secure . When I took office , nearly 180 , 000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , all our troops are out of Iraq . More than 60 , 000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan . With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security , our troops have moved to a support role . Together with our allies , we will complete our mission there by the end of this year , and America s longest war will finally be over . After 2014 , we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future . If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated , a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting Afghan forces , and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda . For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change , one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country . The fact is , that danger remains . While we have put al Qaeda s core leadership on a path to defeat , the threat has evolved , as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world . In Yemen , Somalia , Iraq , and Mali , we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks . In Syria , we will support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks . Here at home , we will keep strengthening our defenses , and combat new threats like cyberattacks . And as we reform our defense budget , we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform , and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions . We have to remain vigilant . But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone . As Commander in Chief , I have used force when needed to protect the American people , and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office . But I will not send our troops into harm s way unless it is truly necessary nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open ended conflicts . We must fight the battles that need to be fought , not those that terrorists prefer from us large scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism . So , even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners America must move off a permanent war footing . That is why I have imposed prudent limits on the use of drones for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence . That is why , working with this Congress , I will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence , here and abroad , that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated . And with the Afghan war ending , this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action , but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals , and setting an example for the rest of the world . You see , in a world of complex threats , our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power including strong and principled diplomacy . American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands , and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles . American diplomacy , backed by the threat of force , is why Syria s chemical weapons are being eliminated , and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship , terror and fear . As we speak , American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians , and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side . And it is American diplomacy , backed by pressure , that has halted the progress of Iran s nuclear program and rolled parts of that program back for the very first time in a decade . As we gather here tonight , Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium . It is not installing advanced centrifuges . Unprecedented inspections help the world verify , every day , that Iran is not building a bomb . And with our allies and partners , we are engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . These negotiations will be difficult . They may not succeed . We are clear eyed about Iran s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , which threaten our allies and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away . But these negotiations do not rely on trust any long term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb . If John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union , then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today . The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible . But let me be clear if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks , I will veto it . For the sake of our national security , we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed . If Iran s leaders do not seize this opportunity , then I will be the first to call for more sanctions , and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon . But if Iran s leaders do seize the chance , then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations , and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war . Finally , let us remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats , but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge greater cooperation , to expand new markets , to free people from fear and want . And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America . Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known . From Tunisia to Burma , we are supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy . In Ukraine , we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully , and have a say in their country s future . Across Africa , we are bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty . In the Americas , we are building new ties of commerce , but we are also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people . And we will continue to focus on the Asia Pacific , where we support our allies , shape a future of greater security and prosperity , and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster as we did in the Philippines , when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon , and were greeted with words like , We will never forget your kindness and God bless America We do these things because they help promote our long term security . And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being , regardless of race or religion , creed or sexual orientation . And next week , the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red , white , and blue into the Olympic Stadium and brings home the gold . My fellow Americans , no other country in the world does what we do . On every issue , the world turns to us , not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for , and the burdens we bear to advance them . No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform . As this time of war draws to a close , a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life . We will keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they have earned , and our wounded warriors receive the health care including the mental health care that they need . We will keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home . And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families . Let me tell you about one of those families I have come to know . I first met Cory Remsburg , a proud Army Ranger , at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D Day . Along with some of his fellow Rangers , he walked me through the program a strong , impressive young man , with an easy manner , sharp as a tack . We joked around , and took pictures , and I told him to stay in touch . A few months later , on his tenth deployment , Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan . His comrades found him in a canal , face down , underwater , shrapnel in his brain . For months , he lay in a coma . The next time I met him , in the hospital , he could not speak he could barely move . Over the years , he is endured dozens of surgeries and procedures , and hours of grueling rehab every day . Even now , Cory is still blind in one eye . He still struggles on his left side . But slowly , steadily , with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig , and the community around him , Cory has grown stronger . Day by day , he is learned to speak again and stand again and walk again and he is working toward the day when he can serve his country again . My recovery has not been easy , he says . Nothing in life that is worth anything is easy . Cory is here tonight . And like the Army he loves , like the America he serves , Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up , and he does not quit . My fellow Americans , men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy . Our freedom , our democracy , has never been easy . Sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged . But for more than two hundred years , we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice , and fairness , and equality under the law , so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen . The America we want for our kids a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us none of it is easy . But if we work together if we summon what is best in us , with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow I know it is within our reach . Believe it . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans We are 15 years into this new century . Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world . It has been , and still is , a hard time for many . But tonight , we turn the page . Tonight , after a breakthrough year for America , our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 . Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis . More of our kids are graduating than ever before . More of our people are insured than ever before . And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years . Tonight , for the first time since 9 11 , our combat mission in Afghanistan is over . Six years ago , nearly 180 , 000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , fewer than 15 , 000 remain . And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9 11 Generation who has served to keep us safe . We are humbled and grateful for your service . America , for all that we have endured for all the grit and hard work required to come back for all the tasks that lie ahead , know this The shadow of crisis has passed , and the State of the Union is strong . At this moment with a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , booming energy production we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth . It is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come . Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort Will we approach the world fearful and reactive , dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing Or will we lead wisely , using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward In two weeks , I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical , not partisan . And in the months ahead , I will crisscross the country making a case for those ideas . So tonight , I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals , and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us . It begins with our economy . Seven years ago , Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds . She waited tables . He worked construction . Their first child , Jack , was on the way . They were young and in love in America . And it does not get much better than that . If only we had known , Rebekah wrote to me last spring , what was about to happen to the housing and construction market . As the crisis worsened , Ben s business dried up , so he took what jobs he could find , even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time . Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college , and retrained for a new career . They sacrificed for each other . And slowly , it paid off . They bought their first home . They had a second son , Henry . Rebekah got a better job and then a raise . Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night . It is amazing , Rebekah wrote , what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong , tight knit family who has made it through some very , very hard times . We are a strong , tight knit family who has made it through some very , very hard times . America , Rebekah and Ben s story is our story . They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped , and sacrificed and retooled . You are the reason that I ran for this office . You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today , in the darkest months of the crisis , when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation . And it has been your resilience , your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger . We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores . And over the past five years , our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs . We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet . And today , America is number one in oil and gas . America is number one in wind power . Every three weeks , we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008 . And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards , the typical family this year should save about 750 at the pump . We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world . And today , our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record . Our high school graduation rate has hit an all time high . More Americans finish college than ever before . We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis , shield families from ruin , and encourage fair competition . Today , we have new tools to stop taxpayer funded bailouts , and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices . And in the past year alone , about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage . At every step , we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious that we would crush jobs and explode deficits . Instead , we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade , our deficits cut by two thirds , a stock market that has doubled , and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years . This is good news , people . So the verdict is clear . Middle class economics works . Expanding opportunity works . And these policies will continue to work as long as politics do not get in the way . We cannot slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns . We cannot put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance , or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street , or refighting past battles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system . And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things , I will veto it . It will have earned my veto . Today , thanks to a growing economy , the recovery is touching more and more lives . Wages are finally starting to rise again . We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007 . But here s the thing Those of us here tonight , we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government does not screw things up that government does not halt the progress we are making . We need to do more than just do no harm . Tonight , together , let us do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American . Because families like Rebekah s still need our help . She and Ben are working as hard as ever , but they have had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement . Friday night pizza , that is a big splurge . Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage , and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota . Like millions of hardworking Americans , Rebekah is not asking for a handout , but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead . And in fact , at every moment of economic change throughout our history , this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot . We set up worker protections , Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity . We gave our citizens schools and colleges , infrastructure and the Internet tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them . That is what middle class economics is the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot , everyone does their fair share , everyone plays by the same set of rules . We do not just want everyone to share in America s success , we want everyone to contribute to our success . So what does middle class economics require in our time First , middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change . That means helping folks afford childcare , college , health care , a home , retirement . And my budget will address each of these issues , lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year . Here s one example . During World War Iwhen men like my grandfather went off to war , having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority so this country provided universal childcare . In today s economy , when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families , we need affordable , high quality childcare more than ever . It is not a nice to have it is a must have . So it is time we stop treating childcare as a side issue , or as a women s issue , and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us . And that is why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low income family with young children in America by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to 3 , 000 per child , per year . Here s another example . Today , we are the only advanced country on Earth that does not guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers . Forty three million workers have no paid sick leave 43 million . Think about that . And that forces too many parents to make the gut wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home . So I will be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own . And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November , let us put it to a vote right here in Washington . Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave . It is the right thing to do . It is the right thing to do . Of course , nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages . That is why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work . It is 2015 . It is time . We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned . And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage , I say this If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than 15 , 000 a year , try it . If not , vote to give millions of the hardest working people in America a raise . Now , these ideas will not make everybody rich , will not relieve every hardship . That is not the job of government . To give working families a fair shot , we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company s long term interest . We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions , and give American workers a voice . But you know , things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families . That is a fact . And that is what all of us , Republicans and Democrats alike , were sent here to do . Second , to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road , we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills . America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free , sent a generation of GIs to college , trained the best workforce in the world . We were ahead of the curve . But other countries caught on . And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before , we need to up our game . We need to do more . By the end of this decade , two in three job openings will require some higher education two in three . And yet , we still live in a country where too many bright , striving Americans are priced out of the education they need . It is not fair to them , and it is sure not smart for our future . That is why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero . Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college . Some are young and starting out . Some are older and looking for a better job . Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market . Whoever you are , this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt . Understand , you have got to earn it . You have got to keep your grades up and graduate on time . Tennessee , a state with Republican leadership , and Chicago , a city with Democratic leadership , are showing that free community college is possible . I want to spread that idea all across America , so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today . Let us stay ahead of the curve . And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt does not derail anyone s dreams . Thanks to Vice President Biden s great work to update our job training system , we are connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high paying jobs like coding , and nursing , and robotics . Tonight , I am also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPand offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they do not have a higher education . And as a new generation of veterans comes home , we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend . Already , we have made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care . We are slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need . And we are making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs . And Joining Forces , the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden thank you , Michelle thank you , Jill has helped nearly 700 , 000 veterans and military spouses get a new job . So to every CEO in America , let me repeat If you want somebody who is going to get the job done and done right , hire a veteran . Finally , as we better train our workers , we need the new economy to keep churning out high wage jobs for our workers to fill . Since 2010 , America has put more people back to work than Europe , Japan , and all advanced economies combined . Our manufacturers have added almost 800 , 000 new jobs . Some of our bedrock sectors , like our auto industry , are booming . But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that did not even exist 10 or 20 years ago jobs at companies like Google , and eBay , and Tesla . So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future . But we do know we want them here in America . We know that . And that is why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere , the place where businesses want to locate and hire . Twenty first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure modern ports , and stronger bridges , faster trains and the fastest Internet . Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this . So let us set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline . Let us pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year , and make this country stronger for decades to come . Let us do it . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . Twenty first century businesses , including small businesses , need to sell more American products overseas . Today , our businesses export more than ever , and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages . But as we speak , China wants to write the rules for the world s fastest growing region . That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage . Why would we let that happen We should write those rules . We should level the playing field . That is why I am asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers , with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that are not just free , but are also fair . It is the right thing to do . Look , I am the first one to admit that past trade deals have not always lived up to the hype , and that is why we have gone after countries that break the rules at our expense . But 95 percent of the world s customers live outside our borders . We cannot close ourselves off from those opportunities . More than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from China . So let us give them one more reason to get it done . Twenty first century businesses will rely on American science and technology , research and development . I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine one that delivers the right treatment at the right time . In some patients with cystic fibrosis , this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable . So tonight , I am launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes , and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier . We can do this . I intend to protect a free and open Internet , extend its reach to every classroom , and every community and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world . I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs converting sunlight into liquid fuel creating revolutionary prosthetics , so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again . Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit , but to stay . Last month , we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars . And in two months , to prepare us for those missions , Scott Kelly will begin a year long stay in space . So good luck , Captain . Make sure to Instagram it . We are proud of you . Now , the truth is , when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research , I know there is bipartisan support in this chamber . Members of both parties have told me so . Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments . As Americans , we do not mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does , too . But for far too long , lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight . They have riddled it with giveaways that the super rich do not need , while denying a break to middle class families who do . This year , we have an opportunity to change that . Let us close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad , and reward those that invest here in America . Let us use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home . Let us simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement , instead of the number of accountants she can afford . And let us close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth . We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college . We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy , and we can achieve that together . We can achieve it together . Helping hardworking families make ends meet . Giving them the tools they need for good paying jobs in this new economy . Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness . This is where America needs to go . I believe it is where the American people want to go . It will make our economy stronger a year from now , 15 years from now , and deep into the century ahead . Of course , if there is one thing this new century has taught us , it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores . My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America . In doing so , the question is not whether America leads in the world , but how . When we make rash decisions , reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts , and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer , more prosperous world . That is what our enemies want us to do . I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership . We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition building when we do not let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents . That is exactly what we are doing right now . And around the globe , it is making a difference . First , we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris . We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks , and we reserve the right to act unilaterally , as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies . At the same time , we have learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years . Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan , we have trained their security forces , who have now taken the lead , and we have honored our troops sacrifice by supporting that country s first democratic transition . Instead of sending large ground forces overseas , we are partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America . In Iraq and Syria , American leadership including our military power is stopping ISIL s advance . Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East , we are leading a broad coalition , including Arab nations , to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group . We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort , and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism . Now , this effort will take time . It will require focus . But we will succeed . And tonight , I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIWe need that authority . Second , we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy . We are upholding the principle that bigger nations cannot bully the small by opposing Russian aggression , and supporting Ukraine s democracy , and reassuring our NATO allies . Last year , as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies , as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states , Putin s aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength . That is what I heard from some folks . Well , today , it is America that stands strong and united with our allies , while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters . That is how America leads not with bluster , but with persistent , steady resolve . In Cuba , we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date . When what you are doing does not work for 50 years , it is time to try something new . And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere . It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba . It stands up for democratic values , and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people . And this year , Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo . As His Holiness , Pope Francis , has said , diplomacy is the work of small steps . These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba . And after years in prison , we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs . Welcome home , Alan . We are glad you are here . Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran , where , for the first time in a decade , we have halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material . Between now and this spring , we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear armed Iran , secures America and our allies including Israel , while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict . There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed , and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran . But new sanctions passed by this Congress , at this moment in time , will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating America from its allies making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again . It does not make sense . And that is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress . The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort , and I intend to stay true to that wisdom . Third , we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century . No foreign nation , no hacker , should be able to shut down our networks , steal our trade secrets , or invade the privacy of American families , especially our kids . So we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats , just as we have done to combat terrorism . And tonight , I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks , combat identity theft , and protect our children s information . That should be a bipartisan effort . If we do not act , we will leave our nation and our economy vulnerable . If we do , we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe . In West Africa , our troops , our scientists , our doctors , our nurses , our health care workers are rolling back Ebola saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease . I could not be prouder of them , and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts . But the job is not yet done , and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics , invest in smart development , and eradicate extreme poverty . In the Asia Pacific , we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade , how they resolve maritime disputes , how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief . And no challenge no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change . 2014 was the planet s warmest year on record . Now , one year does not make a trend , but this does 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century . I have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists that we do not have enough information to act . Well , I am not a scientist , either . But you know what , I know a lot of really good scientists at NASand at NOAand at our major universities . And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate , and if we do not act forcefully , we will continue to see rising oceans , longer , hotter heat waves , dangerous droughts and floods , and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe . The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security . We should act like it . And that is why , over the past six years , we have done more than ever to combat climate change , from the way we produce energy to the way we use it . That is why we have set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history . And that is whyI will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts . I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action . In Beijing , we made a historic announcement The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution . And China committed , for the first time , to limiting their emissions . And because the world s two largest economies came together , other nations are now stepping up , and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got . And there is one last pillar of our leadership , and that is the example of our values . As Americans , we respect human dignity , even when we are threatened , which is why I have prohibited torture , and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained . It is why we speak out against the deplorable anti Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world . It is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims , the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace . That is why we defend free speech , and advocate for political prisoners , and condemn the persecution of women , or religious minorities , or people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender . We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do , but because ultimately they will make us safer . As Americans , we have a profound commitment to justice . So it makes no sense to spend 3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit . Since I have been President , we have worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half . Now it is time to finish the job . And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down . It is not who we are . It is time to close Gitmo . As Americans , we cherish our civil liberties , and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks . So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs , I have not . As promised , our intelligence agencies have worked hard , with the recommendations of privacy advocates , to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse . And next month , we will issue a report on how we are keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy . Looking to the future instead of the past . Making sure we match our power with diplomacy , and use force wisely . Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities . Leading always with the example of our values . That is what makes us exceptional . That is what keeps us strong . That is why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards our own . You know , just over a decade ago , I gave a speech in Boston where I said there was not a liberal America or a conservative America a black America or a white America but a United States of America . I said this because I had seen it in my own life , in a nation that gave someone like me a chance because I grew up in Hawaii , a melting pot of races and customs because I made Illinois my home a state of small towns , rich farmland , one of the world s great cities a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents , good people of every ethnicity and every faith , share certain bedrock values . Over the past six years , the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency has not delivered on this vision . How ironic , they say , that our politics seems more divided than ever . It is held up as proof not just of my own flaws of which there are many but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided , naive , that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it . I know how tempting such cynicism may be . But I still think the cynics are wrong . I still believe that we are one people . I still believe that together , we can do great things , even when the odds are long . I believe this because over and over in my six years in office , I have seen America at its best . I have seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California , and our newest officers at West Point , Annapolis , Colorado Springs , New London . I have mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown , in Boston , in West Texas , and West Virginia . I have watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains , from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid Atlantic seaboard . I have seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country , a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 Americans call home . So I know the good , and optimistic , and big hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brother s keeper and our sister s keeper . And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example . So the question for those of us here tonight is how we , all of us , can better reflect America s hopes . I have served in Congress with many of you . I know many of you well . There are a lot of good people here , on both sides of the aisle . And many of you have told me that this is not what you signed up for arguing past each other on cable shows , the constant fundraising , always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision . Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns . Imagine if we did something different . Understand , a better politics is not one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine . A better politics is one where we appeal to each other s basic decency instead of our basest fears . A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other where we talk issues and values , and principles and facts , rather than gotcha moments , or trivial gaffes , or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people s daily lives . A politics a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter , and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility , asking them to join in the great mission of building America . If we are going to have arguments , let us have arguments , but let us make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country . We still may not agree on a woman s right to choose , but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all time lows , and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs . Yes , passions still fly on immigration , but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student , and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child , and that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants . I have talked to Republicans and Democrats about that . That is something that we can share . We may go at it in campaign season , but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred that it is being denied to too many and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act , we can come together , Democrats and Republicans , to make voting easier for every single American . We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York . But surely we can understand a father who fears his son cannot walk home without being harassed . And surely we can understand the wife who will not rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift . And surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years , the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together , and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans , community leaders and law enforcement , to reform America s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us . That is a better politics . That is how we start rebuilding trust . That is how we move this country forward . That is what the American people want . And that is what they deserve . I have no more campaigns to run . My only agenda I know because I won both of them . My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol to do what I believe is best for America . If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight , I ask you to join me in the work at hand . If you disagree with parts of it , I hope you will at least work with me where you do agree . And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas , I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger . Because I want this chamber , I want this city to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings , we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides , to unite in common effort , to help our neighbors , whether down the street or on the other side of the world . I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood , your life matters , and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids . I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift , that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen man and woman , young and old , black and white , Latino , Asian , immigrant , Native American , gay , straight , Americans with mental illness or physical disability . Everybody matters . I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states that we are the United States of America . I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past six years It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong , tight knit family who is made it through some very , very hard times . My fellow Americans , we , too , are a strong , tight knit family . We , too , have made it through some hard times . Fifteen years into this new century , we have picked ourselves up , dusted ourselves off , and begun again the work of remaking America . We have laid a new foundation . A brighter future is ours to write . Let us begin this new chapter together and let us start the work right now . Thank you . God bless you . God bless this country we love . Thank you .<speech_sep>Thank you . Muchas gracias . Thank you so much . Thank you very much . President Castro , the people of Cuba , thank you so much for the warm welcome that I have received , that my family have received , and that our delegation has received . It is an extraordinary honor to be here today . Before I begin , please indulge me . I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels . The thoughts and the prayers of the American people are with the people of Belgium . We stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people . We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally , Belgium , in bringing to justice those who are responsible . And this is yet another reminder that the world must unite , we must be together , regardless of nationality , or race , or faith , in fighting against the scourge of terrorism . We can and will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world . To the government and the people of Cuba , I want to thank you for the kindness that you have shown to me and Michelle , Malia , Sasha , my mother in law , Marian . Cultivo una rosa blanca . In his most famous poem , Jose Marti made this offering of friendship and peace to both his friend and his enemy . Today , as the President of the United States of America , I offer the Cuban people el saludo de paz . Havana is only 90 miles from Florida , but to get here we had to travel a great distance over barriers of history and ideology barriers of pain and separation . The blue waters beneath Air Force One once carried American battleships to this island to liberate , but also to exert control over Cuba . Those waters also carried generations of Cuban revolutionaries to the United States , where they built support for their cause . And that short distance has been crossed by hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles on planes and makeshift rafts who came to America in pursuit of freedom and opportunity , sometimes leaving behind everything they owned and every person that they loved . Like so many people in both of our countries , my lifetime has spanned a time of isolation between us . The Cuban Revolution took place the same year that my father came to the United States from Kenya . The Bay of Pigs took place the year that I was born . The next year , the entire world held its breath , watching our two countries , as humanity came as close as we ever have to the horror of nuclear war . As the decades rolled by , our governments settled into a seemingly endless confrontation , fighting battles through proxies . In a world that remade itself time and again , one constant was the conflict between the United States and Cuba . I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas . I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people . I want to be clear The differences between our governments over these many years are real and they are important . I am sure President Castro would say the same thing I know , because I have heard him address those differences at length . But before I discuss those issues , we also need to recognize how much we share . Because in many ways , the United States and Cuba are like two brothers who have been estranged for many years , even as we share the same blood . We both live in a new world , colonized by Europeans . Cuba , like the United States , was built in part by slaves brought here from Africa . Like the United States , the Cuban people can trace their heritage to both slaves and slave owners . We have welcomed both immigrants who came a great distance to start new lives in the Americas . Over the years , our cultures have blended together . Carlos Finlay s work in Cuba paved the way for generations of doctors , including Walter Reed , who drew on Finlay s work to help combat Yellow Fever . Just as Marti wrote some of his most famous words in New York , Ernest Hemingway made a home in Cuba , and found inspiration in the waters of these shores . We share a national past time La Pelota and later today our players will compete on the same Havana field that Jackie Robinson played on before he made his Major League debut . And it is said that our greatest boxer , Muhammad Ali , once paid tribute to a Cuban that he could never fight saying that he would only be able to reach a draw with the great Cuban , Teofilo Stevenson . So even as our governments became adversaries , our people continued to share these common passions , particularly as so many Cubans came to America . In Miami or Havana , you can find places to dance the Cha Cha Cha or the Salsa , and eat ropa vieja . People in both of our countries have sung along with Celia Cruz or Gloria Estefan , and now listen to reggaeton or Pitbull . Millions of our people share a common religion a faith that I paid tribute to at the Shrine of our Lady of Charity in Miami , a peace that Cubans find in La Cachita . For all of our differences , the Cuban and American people share common values in their own lives . A sense of patriotism and a sense of pride a lot of pride . A profound love of family . A passion for our children , a commitment to their education . And that is why I believe our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration , as just one chapter in a longer story of family and of friendship . But we cannot , and should not , ignore the very real differences that we have about how we organize our governments , our economies , and our societies . Cuba has a one party system the United States is a multi party democracy . Cuba has a socialist economic model the United States is an open market . Cuba has emphasized the role and rights of the state the United States is founded upon the rights of the individual . Despite these differences , on December 17th 2014 , President Castro and I announced that the United States and Cuba would begin a process to normalize relations between our countries . Since then , we have established diplomatic relations and opened embassies . We have begun initiatives to cooperate on health and agriculture , education and law enforcement . We have reached agreements to restore direct flights and mail service . We have expanded commercial ties , and increased the capacity of Americans to travel and do business in Cuba . And these changes have been welcomed , even though there are still opponents to these policies . But still , many people on both sides of this debate have asked Why now Why now There is one simple answer What the United States was doing was not working . We have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth . A policy of isolation designed for the Cold War made little sense in the 21st century . The embargo was only hurting the Cuban people instead of helping them . And I have always believed in what Martin Luther King , called the fierce urgency of now we should not fear change , we should embrace it . That leads me to a bigger and more important reason for these changes Creo en el pueblo Cubano . I believe in the Cuban people . This is not just a policy of normalizing relations with the Cuban government . The United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people . And today , I want to share with you my vision of what our future can be . I want the Cuban people especially the young people to understand why I believe that you should look to the future with hope not the false promise which insists that things are better than they really are , or the blind optimism that says all your problems can go away tomorrow . Hope that is rooted in the future that you can choose and that you can shape , and that you can build for your country . I am hopeful because I believe that the Cuban people are as innovative as any people in the world . In a global economy , powered by ideas and information , a country s greatest asset is its people . In the United States , we have a clear monument to what the Cuban people can build it is called Miami . Here in Havana , we see that same talent in cuentapropistas , cooperatives and old cars that still run . El Cubano inventa del aire . Cuba has an extraordinary resource a system of education which values every boy and every girl . And in recent years , the Cuban government has begun to open up to the world , and to open up more space for that talent to thrive . In just a few years , we have seen how cuentapropistas can succeed while sustaining a distinctly Cuban spirit . Being self employed is not about becoming more like America , it is about being yourself . Look at Sandra Lidice Aldama , who chose to start a small business . Cubans , she said , can innovate and adapt without losing our identity hellip our secret is in not copying or imitating but simply being ourselves . Look at Papito Valladeres , a barber , whose success allowed him to improve conditions in his neighborhood . I realize I am not going to solve all of the world s problems , he said . But if I can solve problems in the little piece of the world where I live , it can ripple across Havana . That is where hope begins with the ability to earn your own living , and to build something you can be proud of . That is why our policies focus on supporting Cubans , instead of hurting them . That is why we got rid of limits on remittances so ordinary Cubans have more resources . That is why we are encouraging travel which will build bridges between our people , and bring more revenue to those Cuban small businesses . That is why we have opened up space for commerce and exchanges so that Americans and Cubans can work together to find cures for diseases , and create jobs , and open the door to more opportunity for the Cuban people . As President of the United States , I have called on our Congress to lift the embargo . It is an outdated burden on the Cuban people . It is a burden on the Americans who want to work and do business or invest here in Cuba . It is time to lift the embargo . But even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow , Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba . It should be easier to open a business here in Cuba . A worker should be able to get a job directly with companies who invest here in Cuba . Two currencies should not separate the type of salaries that Cubans can earn . The Internet should be available across the island , so that Cubans can connect to the wider world and to one of the greatest engines of growth in human history . There is no limitation from the United States on the ability of Cuba to take these steps . It is up to you . And I can tell you as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the 21st century depends upon education , health care , and environmental protection . But it also depends on the free and open exchange of ideas . If you cannot access information online , if you cannot be exposed to different points of view , you will not reach your full potential . And over time , the youth will lose hope . I know these issues are sensitive , especially coming from an American President . Before 1959 , some Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit , ignored poverty , enabled corruption . And since 1959 , we have been shadow boxers in this battle of geopolitics and personalities . I know the history , but I refuse to be trapped by it . I have made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity , nor the intention to impose change on Cuba . What changes come will depend upon the Cuban people . We will not impose our political or economic system on you . We recognize that every country , every people , must chart its own course and shape its own model . But having removed the shadow of history from our relationship , I must speak honestly about the things that I believe the things that we , as Americans , believe . As Marti said , Liberty is the right of every man to be honest , to think and to speak without hypocrisy . So let me tell you what I believe . I cannot force you to agree , but you should know what I think . I believe that every person should be equal under the law . Every child deserves the dignity that comes with education , and health care and food on the table and a roof over their heads . I believe citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear to organize , and to criticize their government , and to protest peacefully , and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detentions of people who exercise those rights . I believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly . And , yes , I believe voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections . Not everybody agrees with me on this . Not everybody agrees with the American people on this . But I believe those human rights are universal . I believe they are the rights of the American people , the Cuban people , and people around the world . Now , there is no secret that our governments disagree on many of these issues . I have had frank conversations with President Castro . For many years , he has pointed out the flaws in the American system economic inequality the death penalty racial discrimination wars abroad . That is just a sample . He has a much longer list . But here s what the Cuban people need to understand I welcome this open debate and dialogue . It is good . It is healthy . I am not afraid of it . We do have too much money in American politics . But , in America , it is still possible for somebody like me a child who was raised by a single mom , a child of mixed race who did not have a lot of money to pursue and achieve the highest office in the land . That is what is possible in America . We do have challenges with racial bias in our communities , in our criminal justice system , in our society the legacy of slavery and segregation . But the fact that we have open debates within America s own democracy is what allows us to get better . In 1959 , the year that my father moved to America , it was illegal for him to marry my mother , who was white , in many American states . When I first started school , we were still struggling to desegregate schools across the American South . But people organized they protested they debated these issues they challenged government officials . And because of those protests , and because of those debates , and because of popular mobilization , I am able to stand here today as an African American and as President of the United States . That was because of the freedoms that were afforded in the United States that we were able to bring about change . I am not saying this is easy . There is still enormous problems in our society . But democracy is the way that we solve them . That is how we got health care for more of our people . That is how we made enormous gains in women s rights and gay rights . That is how we address the inequality that concentrates so much wealth at the top of our society . Because workers can organize and ordinary people have a voice , American democracy has given our people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and enjoy a high standard of living . Now , there are still some tough fights . It is not always pretty , the process of democracy . It is often frustrating . You can see that in the election going on back home . But just stop and consider this fact about the American campaign that is taking place right now . You had two Cuban Americans in the Republican Party , running against the legacy of a black man who is President , while arguing that they are the best person to beat the Democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a Democratic Socialist . Who would have believed that back in 1959 That is a measure of our progress as a democracy . So here s my message to the Cuban government and the Cuban people The ideals that are the starting point for every revolution America s revolution , Cuba s revolution , the liberation movements around the world those ideals find their truest expression , I believe , in democracy . Not because American democracy is perfect , but precisely because we are not . And we like every country need the space that democracy gives us to change . It gives individuals the capacity to be catalysts to think in new ways , and to reimagine how our society should be , and to make them better . There is already an evolution taking place inside of Cuba , a generational change . Many suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down but I am appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up , build something new . El futurode Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo Cubano . And to President Castro who I appreciate being here today I want you to know , I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States . And given your commitment to Cuba s sovereignty and self determination , I am also confident that you need not fear the different voices of the Cuban people and their capacity to speak , and assemble , and vote for their leaders . In fact , I am hopeful for the future because I trust that the Cuban people will make the right decisions . And as you do , I am also confident that Cuba can continue to play an important role in the hemisphere and around the globe and my hope is , is that you can do so as a partner with the United States . We have played very different roles in the world . But no one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and suffering . Last year , American health care workers and the military worked side by side with Cubans to save lives and stamp out Ebola in West Africa . I believe that we should continue that kind of cooperation in other countries . We have been on the different side of so many conflicts in the Americas . But today , Americans and Cubans are sitting together at the negotiating table , and we are helping the Colombian people resolve a civil war that is dragged on for decades . That kind of cooperation is good for everybody . It gives everyone in this hemisphere hope . We took different journeys to our support for the people of South Africa in ending apartheid . But President Castro and I could both be there in Johannesburg to pay tribute to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela . And in examining his life and his words , I am sure we both realize we have more work to do to promote equality in our own countries to reduce discrimination based on race in our own countries . And in Cuba , we want our engagement to help lift up the Cubans who are of African descent who have proven that there is nothing they cannot achieve when given the chance . We have been a part of different blocs of nations in the hemisphere , and we will continue to have profound differences about how to promote peace , security , opportunity , and human rights . But as we normalize our relations , I believe it can help foster a greater sense of unity in the Americas todos somos Americanos . From the beginning of my time in office , I have urged the people of the Americas to leave behind the ideological battles of the past . We are in a new era . I know that many of the issues that I have talked about lack the drama of the past . And I know that part of Cuba s identity is its pride in being a small island nation that could stand up for its rights , and shake the world . But I also know that Cuba will always stand out because of the talent , hard work , and pride of the Cuban people . That is your strength . Cuba does not have to be defined by being against the United States , any more than the United States should be defined by being against Cuba . I am hopeful for the future because of the reconciliation that is taking place among the Cuban people . I know that for some Cubans on the island , there may be a sense that those who left somehow supported the old order in Cuba . I am sure there is a narrative that lingers here which suggests that Cuban exiles ignored the problems of pre Revolutionary Cuba , and rejected the struggle to build a new future . But I can tell you today that so many Cuban exiles carry a memory of painful and sometimes violent separation . They love Cuba . A part of them still considers this their true home . That is why their passion is so strong . That is why their heartache is so great . And for the Cuban American community that I have come to know and respect , this is not just about politics . This is about family the memory of a home that was lost the desire to rebuild a broken bond the hope for a better future the hope for return and reconciliation . For all of the politics , people are people , and Cubans are Cubans . And I have come here I have traveled this distance on a bridge that was built by Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits . I first got to know the talent and passion of the Cuban people in America . And I know how they have suffered more than the pain of exile they also know what it is like to be an outsider , and to struggle , and to work harder to make sure their children can reach higher in America . So the reconciliation of the Cuban people the children and grandchildren of revolution , and the children and grandchildren of exile that is fundamental to Cuba s future . You see it in Gloria Gonzalez , who traveled here in 2013 for the first time after 61 years of separation , and was met by her sister , Llorca . You recognized me , but I did not recognize you , Gloria said after she embraced her sibling . Imagine that , after 61 years . You see it in Melinda Lopez , who came to her family s old home . And as she was walking the streets , an elderly woman recognized her as her mother s daughter , and began to cry . She took her into her home and showed her a pile of photos that included Melinda s baby picture , which her mother had sent 50 years ago . Melinda later said , So many of us are now getting so much back . You see it in Cristian Miguel Soler , a young man who became the first of his family to travel here after 50 years . And meeting relatives for the first time , he said , I realized that family is family no matter the distance between us . Sometimes the most important changes start in small places . The tides of history can leave people in conflict and exile and poverty . It takes time for those circumstances to change . But the recognition of a common humanity , the reconciliation of people bound by blood and a belief in one another that is where progress begins . Understanding , and listening , and forgiveness . And if the Cuban people face the future together , it will be more likely that the young people of today will be able to live with dignity and achieve their dreams right here in Cuba . The history of the United States and Cuba encompass revolution and conflict struggle and sacrifice retribution and , now , reconciliation . It is time , now , for us to leave the past behind . It is time for us to look forward to the future together un future de esperanza . And it will not be easy , and there will be setbacks . It will take time . But my time here in Cuba renews my hope and my confidence in what the Cuban people will do . We can make this journey as friends , and as neighbors , and as family together . Si se puede . Muchas gracias .<speech_sep>Hello Rutgers R U rah rah Thank you so much . Thank you . Everybody , please have a seat . Thank you , President Barchi , for that introduction . Let me congratulate my extraordinarily worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights , Burnell and Bill Moyers . Matthew , good job . If you are interested , we can talk after this . One of the perks of my job is honorary degrees . But I have to tell you , it impresses nobody in my house . Now Malia and Sasha just say , Okay , Dad , we will see you later . Can we have some money To the Board of Governors to Chairman Brown to Lieutenant Governor Guadagno Mayor Cahill Mayor Wahler , members of Congress , Rutgers administrators , faculty , staff , friends , and family thank you for the honor of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution . But most of all , congratulations to the Class of 2016 I come here for a simple reason to finally settle this pork roll vs . Taylor ham question . I am just kidding . There is not much I am afraid to take on in my final year of office , but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate . The truth is , Rutgers , I came here because you asked . Now , it is true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year . But you are the first to launch a three year campaign . Emails , letters , tweets , YouTube videos . I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president . And I have to say that really sealed the deal . That was smart , because I have a soft spot for grandmas . So I am here , off Exit 9 , on the banks of the Old Raritan at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges . Winners of the first ever college football game . One of the newest members of the Big Ten . Home of what I understand to be a Grease Truck for a Fat Sandwich . Mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers on your cheesesteaks I am sure Michelle would approve . But somehow , you have survived such death defying acts . You also survived the daily jockeying for buses , from Livingston to Busch , to Cook , to Douglass , and back again . I suspect that a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon , after a late night at Olde Queens . You know who you are . But , however you got here , you made it . You made it . Today , you join a long line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heights its founders could not have imagined . Two hundred and fifty years ago , when America was still just an idea , a charter from the Royal Governor Ben Franklin s son established Queen s College . A few years later , a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for the first class . And from that first class in a pub , Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest research institutions in America . This is a place where you 3D print prosthetic hands for children , and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean , renewable energy . Every day , tens of thousands of students come here , to this intellectual melting pot , where ideas and cultures flow together among what might just be America s most diverse student body . Here in New Brunswick , you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class , and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus with a first generation Latina student from Jersey City , before sitting down for your psych group project with a veteran who is going to school on the Post 9 11 GI Bill . America converges here . And in so many ways , the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America the course by which we became bigger , stronger , and richer and more dynamic , and a more inclusive nation . But America s progress has never been smooth or steady . Progress does not travel in a straight line . It zigs and zags in fits and starts . Progress in America has been hard and contentious , and sometimes bloody . It remains uneven and at times , for every two steps forward , it feels like we take one step back . Now , for some of you , this may sound like your college career . It sounds like mine , anyway . Which makes sense , because measured against the whole of human history , America remains a very young nation younger , even , than this university . But progress is bumpy . It always has been . But because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists , progress has been this nation s hallmark . I am fond of quoting Martin Luther King , , who said , The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice . It bends towards justice . I believe that . But I also believe that the arc of our nation , the arc of the world does not bend towards justice , or freedom , or equality , or prosperity on its own . It depends on us , on the choices we make , particularly at certain inflection points in history particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs . And , Class of 2016 , you are graduating at such an inflection point . Since the start of this new millennium , you have already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks , and war , and a Great Recession . You have seen economic and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work and how we communicate , how we live , how we form families . The pace of change is not subsiding it is accelerating . And these changes offer not only great opportunity , but also great peril . Fortunately , your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future . I am confident that you can make the right choices away from fear and division and paralysis , and toward cooperation and innovation and hope . Now , partly , I am confident because , on average , you are smarter and better educated than my generation although we probably had better penmanship and were certainly better spellers . We did not have spell check back in my day . You are not only better educated , you have been more exposed to the world , more exposed to other cultures . You are more diverse . You are more environmentally conscious . You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom . So you have got the tools to lead us . And precisely because I have so much confidence in you , I am not going to spend the remainder of my time telling you exactly how you are going to make the world better . You will figure it out . You will look at things with fresher eyes , unencumbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandparents and old heads like me . But I do have a couple of suggestions that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world . Point number one When you hear someone longing for the good old days , take it with a grain of salt . Take it with a grain of salt . We live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history . We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before . But I guess it is part of human nature , especially in times of change and uncertainty , to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked , and the economy hummed , and all politicians were wise , and every kid was well mannered , and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world . Guess what . It am not so . The good old days were not that great . Yes , there have been some stretches in our history where the economy grew much faster , or when government ran more smoothly . There were moments when , immediately after World War Ifor example , or the end of the Cold War , when the world bent more easily to our will . But those are sporadic , those moments , those episodes . In fact , by almost every measure , America is better , and the world is better , than it was 50 years ago , or 30 years ago , or even eight years ago . And by the way , I am not set aside 150 years ago , pre Civil War there is a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about . Set aside life in the 50s , when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life . Since I graduated , in 1983 which is not that long ago I am just saying . Since I graduated , crime rates , teenage pregnancy , the share of Americans living in poverty they are all down . The share of Americans with college educations have gone way up . Our life expectancy has , as well . Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and politics . More women are in the workforce . They are earning more money although it is long past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men . Meanwhile , in the eight years since most of you started high school , we are also better off . You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better prospects than any time since 2007 . Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance . We are less dependent on foreign oil . We have doubled the production of clean energy . We have cut the high school dropout rate . We have cut the deficit by two thirds . Marriage equality is the law of the land . And just as America is better , the world is better than when I graduated . Since I graduated , an Iron Curtain fell , apartheid ended . There is more democracy . We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio . We have cut extreme poverty drastically . We have cut infant mortality by an enormous amount . Now , I say all these things not to make you complacent . We have got a bunch of big problems to solve . But I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history . And the reason America is better is because we did not look backwards we did not fear the future . We seized the future and made it our own . And that is exactly why it is always been young people like you that have brought about big change because you do not fear the future . That leads me to my second point The world is more interconnected than ever before , and it is becoming more connected every day . Building walls will not change that . Look , as President , my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States . And as citizens , we all rightly put our country first . But if the past two decades have taught us anything , it is that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation . When overseas states start falling apart , they become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores . When developing countries do not have functioning health systems , epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans , too . And a wall will not stop that . If we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes , we have got to have the cooperation of other countries in a global financial system to help enforce financial laws . The point is , to help ourselves we have got to help others not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out . And engagement does not just mean deploying our military . There are times where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our allies , and we are in awe of and we are grateful for the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known . But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military , and the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing . They cannot shoulder the entire burden . And engagement means using all the levers of our national power , and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges . You look at something like trade , for example . We live in an age of global supply chains , and cargo ships that crisscross oceans , and online commerce that can render borders obsolete . And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed that is one of the changes that is been taking place jobs shipped overseas , trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage . But the answer is not to stop trading with other countries . In this global economy , that is not even possible . The answer is to do trade the right way , by negotiating with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their environmental standards and we make sure they do not impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual property . That is how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values including human rights . And ultimately , that is how we help raise wages here in America . That is how we help our workers compete on a level playing field . Building walls will not do that . It will not boost our economy , and it will not enhance our security either . Isolating or disparaging Muslims , suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country that is not just a betrayal of our values that is not just a betrayal of who we are , it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism . Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders , and blame our challenges on immigrants that does not just run counter to our history as the world s melting pot it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe . That is how we became America . Why would we want to stop it now Cannot do it . Which brings me to my third point Facts , evidence , reason , logic , an understanding of science these are good things . These are qualities you want in people making policy . These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens . That might seem obvious . That is why we honor Bill Moyers or Burnell . We traditionally have valued those things . But if you were listening to today s political debate , you might wonder where this strain of anti intellectualism came from . So , Class of 2016 , let me be as clear as I can be . In politics and in life , ignorance is not a virtue . It is not cool to not know what you are talking about . That is not keeping it real , or telling it like it is . That is not challenging political correctness . That is just not knowing what you are talking about . And yet , we have become confused about this . Look , our nation s Founders Franklin , Madison , Hamilton , Jefferson they were born of the Enlightenment . They sought to escape superstition , and sectarianism , and tribalism , and no nothingness . They believed in rational thought and experimentation , and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates . That is embedded in our constitutional design . That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers , the Edisons and the Wright Brothers , and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers , and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses . That is what built this country . And today , in every phone in one of your pockets we have access to more information than at any time in human history , at a touch of a button . But , ironically , the flood of information has not made us more discerning of the truth . In some ways , it is just made us more confident in our ignorance . We assume whatever is on the web must be true . We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions . Opinions masquerade as facts . The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel . Now , understand , I am sure you have learned during your years of college and if not , you will learn soon that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense . That is the truth . You will meet them if you have not already . So the fact that they have got a fancy degree you got to talk to them to see whether they know what they are talking about . Qualities like kindness and compassion , honesty , hard work they often matter more than technical skills or know how . But when our leaders express a disdain for facts , when they are not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up , while actual experts are dismissed as elitists , then we have got a problem . You know , it is interesting that if we get sick , we actually want to make sure the doctors have gone to medical school , they know what they are talking about . If we get on a plane , we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane . And yet , in our public lives , we certainly think , I do not want somebody who is done it before . The rejection of facts , the rejection of reason and science that is the path to decline . It calls to mind the words of Carl Sagan , who graduated high school here in New Jersey he said We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers , our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good . The debate around climate change is a perfect example of this . Now , I recognize it does not feel like the planet is warmer right now . I understand . There was hail when I landed in Newark . But think about the climate change issue . Every day , there are officials in high office with responsibilities who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world s scientists that human activities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substances are altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways . A while back , you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as proof that the world was not warming . I mean , listen , climate change is not something subject to political spin . There is evidence . There are facts . We can see it happening right now . If we do not act , if we do not follow through on the progress we made in Paris , the progress we have been making here at home , your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe . So it is up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate . Imagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball , what he would think . Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that . He had get a And he is a senator Look , I am not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion , or faith , or love , or loyalty . I am suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well , and proposed budgets add up , and our environment is protected . And to accomplish those things , to make collective decisions on behalf of a common good , we have to use our heads . We have to agree that facts and evidence matter . And we got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they are talking about . All right . I only have two more points . I know it is getting cold and you guys have to graduate . Point four Have faith in democracy . Look , I know it is not always pretty . Really , I know . I have been living it . But it is how , bit by bit , generation by generation , we have made progress in this nation . That is how we banned child labor . That is how we cleaned up our air and our water . That is how we passed programs like Social Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty . None of these changes happened overnight . They did not happen because some charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything . It did not happen because some massive political revolution occurred . It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy , and organizing , and alliance building , and deal making , and the changing of public opinion . It happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political process . Well , that is nice . I mean , I helped , but Look , if you want to change this country for the better , you better start participating . I will give you an example on a lot of people s minds right now and that is the growing inequality in our economy . Over much of the last century , we have unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen , but over the past few decades , our economy has become more and more unequal . The top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all income in the In the past , it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the average worker . Today , it is 300 times more . And wages are not rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families . Now , if we want to reverse those trends , there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference . We can raise the minimum wage . We can modernize our infrastructure . We can invest in early childhood education . We can make college more affordable . We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement . And if we did these things , then we had help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody . Now , the reason some of these things have not happened , even though the majority of people approve of them , is really simple . It is not because I was not proposing them . It was not because the facts and the evidence showed they would not work . It was because a huge chunk of Americans , especially young people , do not vote . In 2014 , voter turnout was the lowest since World War IFewer than one in five young people showed up to vote 2014 . And the four who stayed home determined the course of this country just as much as the single one who voted . Because apathy has consequences . It determines who our Congress is . It determines what policies they prioritize . It even , for example , determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate . And , yes , big money in politics is a huge problem . We have got to reduce its influence . Yes , special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corridors of power . But , contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right , the system is not as rigged as you think , and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think . Politicians care about being elected , and they especially care about being reelected . And if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views , you will get what you want . And if you opt out , or stop paying attention , you will not . It is that simple . It is not that complicated . Now , one of the reasons that people do not vote is because they do not see the changes they were looking for right away . Well , guess what none of the great strides in our history happened right away . It took Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v . Board of Education and then another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act . And it took more time after that for it to start working . It took a proud daughter of New Jersey , Alice Paul , years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests , and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation , and writing letters and giving speeches , and working with congressional leaders before she and other suffragettes finally helped win women the right to vote . Each stage along the way required compromise . Sometimes you took half a loaf . You forged allies . Sometimes you lost on an issue , and then you came back to fight another day . That is how democracy works . So you have got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification , but you got to be a citizen full time , all the time . And if participation means voting , and it means compromise , and organizing and advocacy , it also means listening to those who do not agree with you . I know a couple years ago , folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement . Now , I do not think it is a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Rice and the previous administration . But the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State , or shutting out what she had to say I believe that is misguided . I do not think that is how democracy works best , when we are not even willing to listen to each other . I believe that is misguided . If you disagree with somebody , bring them in and ask them tough questions . Hold their feet to the fire . Make them defend their positions . If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea , prove it wrong . Engage it . Debate it . Stand up for what you believe in . Do not be scared to take somebody on . Do not feel like you got to shut your ears off because you are too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities . Go at them if they are not making any sense . Use your logic and reason and words . And by doing so , you will strengthen your own position , and you will hone your arguments . And maybe you will learn something and realize you do not know everything . And you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe . Either way , you win . And more importantly , our democracy wins . So , anyway , all right . That is it , Class of 2016 a few suggestions on how you can change the world . Except maybe I have got one last suggestion . Just one . And that is , gear yourself for the long haul . Whatever path you choose business , nonprofits , government , education , health care , the arts whatever it is , you are going to have some setbacks . You will deal occasionally with foolish people . You will be frustrated . You will have a boss that is not great . You will not always get everything you want at least not as fast as you want it . So you have to stick with it . You have to be persistent . And success , however small , however incomplete , success is still success . I always tell my daughters , you know , better is good . It may not be perfect , it may not be great , but it is good . That is how progress happens in societies and in our own lives . So do not lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock . Do not lose hope in the face of naysayers . And certainly do not let resistance make you cynical . Cynicism is so easy , and cynics do not accomplish much . As a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey , a guy named Bruce Springsteen , once sang they spend their lives waiting for a moment that just do not come . Do not let that be you . Do not waste your time waiting . If you doubt you can make a difference , look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already making . Look at what Matthew is doing . Look at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan , who began organizing anti bullying assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination , and here at Rutgers , helped found the Muslim Public Relations Council to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion . Look at somebody like Madison Little , who grew up dealing with some health issues , and started wondering what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else , and so , here at Rutgers , he took charge of a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to address the AIDS epidemic . Our generation has so much energy to adapt and impact the world , he said . My peers give me a lot of hope that we will overcome the obstacles we face in society . That is you Is it any wonder that I am optimistic Throughout our history , a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom , and more opportunity , and more justice . And , Class of 2016 , it is your turn now to shape our nation s destiny , as well as your own . So get to work . Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last . Good luck . God bless you . God bless this country we love . Thank you .<speech_sep>
