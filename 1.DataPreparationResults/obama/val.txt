Hello Rutgers R U rah rah Thank you so much . Thank you . Everybody , please have a seat . Thank you , President Barchi , for that introduction . Let me congratulate my extraordinarily worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights , Burnell and Bill Moyers . Matthew , good job . If you are interested , we can talk after this . One of the perks of my job is honorary degrees . But I have to tell you , it impresses nobody in my house . Now Malia and Sasha just say , Okay , Dad , we will see you later . Can we have some money To the Board of Governors to Chairman Brown to Lieutenant Governor Guadagno Mayor Cahill Mayor Wahler , members of Congress , Rutgers administrators , faculty , staff , friends , and family thank you for the honor of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution . But most of all , congratulations to the Class of 2016 I come here for a simple reason to finally settle this pork roll vs . Taylor ham question . I am just kidding . There is not much I am afraid to take on in my final year of office , but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate . The truth is , Rutgers , I came here because you asked . Now , it is true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year . But you are the first to launch a three year campaign . Emails , letters , tweets , YouTube videos . I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president . And I have to say that really sealed the deal . That was smart , because I have a soft spot for grandmas . So I am here , off Exit 9 , on the banks of the Old Raritan at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges . Winners of the first ever college football game . One of the newest members of the Big Ten . Home of what I understand to be a Grease Truck for a Fat Sandwich . Mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers on your cheesesteaks I am sure Michelle would approve . But somehow , you have survived such death defying acts . You also survived the daily jockeying for buses , from Livingston to Busch , to Cook , to Douglass , and back again . I suspect that a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon , after a late night at Olde Queens . You know who you are . But , however you got here , you made it . You made it . Today , you join a long line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heights its founders could not have imagined . Two hundred and fifty years ago , when America was still just an idea , a charter from the Royal Governor Ben Franklin s son established Queen s College . A few years later , a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for the first class . And from that first class in a pub , Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest research institutions in America . This is a place where you 3D print prosthetic hands for children , and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean , renewable energy . Every day , tens of thousands of students come here , to this intellectual melting pot , where ideas and cultures flow together among what might just be America s most diverse student body . Here in New Brunswick , you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class , and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus with a first generation Latina student from Jersey City , before sitting down for your psych group project with a veteran who is going to school on the Post 9 11 GI Bill . America converges here . And in so many ways , the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America the course by which we became bigger , stronger , and richer and more dynamic , and a more inclusive nation . But America s progress has never been smooth or steady . Progress does not travel in a straight line . It zigs and zags in fits and starts . Progress in America has been hard and contentious , and sometimes bloody . It remains uneven and at times , for every two steps forward , it feels like we take one step back . Now , for some of you , this may sound like your college career . It sounds like mine , anyway . Which makes sense , because measured against the whole of human history , America remains a very young nation younger , even , than this university . But progress is bumpy . It always has been . But because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists , progress has been this nation s hallmark . I am fond of quoting Martin Luther King , , who said , The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice . It bends towards justice . I believe that . But I also believe that the arc of our nation , the arc of the world does not bend towards justice , or freedom , or equality , or prosperity on its own . It depends on us , on the choices we make , particularly at certain inflection points in history particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs . And , Class of 2016 , you are graduating at such an inflection point . Since the start of this new millennium , you have already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks , and war , and a Great Recession . You have seen economic and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work and how we communicate , how we live , how we form families . The pace of change is not subsiding it is accelerating . And these changes offer not only great opportunity , but also great peril . Fortunately , your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future . I am confident that you can make the right choices away from fear and division and paralysis , and toward cooperation and innovation and hope . Now , partly , I am confident because , on average , you are smarter and better educated than my generation although we probably had better penmanship and were certainly better spellers . We did not have spell check back in my day . You are not only better educated , you have been more exposed to the world , more exposed to other cultures . You are more diverse . You are more environmentally conscious . You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom . So you have got the tools to lead us . And precisely because I have so much confidence in you , I am not going to spend the remainder of my time telling you exactly how you are going to make the world better . You will figure it out . You will look at things with fresher eyes , unencumbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandparents and old heads like me . But I do have a couple of suggestions that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world . Point number one When you hear someone longing for the good old days , take it with a grain of salt . Take it with a grain of salt . We live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history . We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before . But I guess it is part of human nature , especially in times of change and uncertainty , to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked , and the economy hummed , and all politicians were wise , and every kid was well mannered , and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world . Guess what . It am not so . The good old days were not that great . Yes , there have been some stretches in our history where the economy grew much faster , or when government ran more smoothly . There were moments when , immediately after World War Ifor example , or the end of the Cold War , when the world bent more easily to our will . But those are sporadic , those moments , those episodes . In fact , by almost every measure , America is better , and the world is better , than it was 50 years ago , or 30 years ago , or even eight years ago . And by the way , I am not set aside 150 years ago , pre Civil War there is a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about . Set aside life in the 50s , when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life . Since I graduated , in 1983 which is not that long ago I am just saying . Since I graduated , crime rates , teenage pregnancy , the share of Americans living in poverty they are all down . The share of Americans with college educations have gone way up . Our life expectancy has , as well . Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and politics . More women are in the workforce . They are earning more money although it is long past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men . Meanwhile , in the eight years since most of you started high school , we are also better off . You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better prospects than any time since 2007 . Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance . We are less dependent on foreign oil . We have doubled the production of clean energy . We have cut the high school dropout rate . We have cut the deficit by two thirds . Marriage equality is the law of the land . And just as America is better , the world is better than when I graduated . Since I graduated , an Iron Curtain fell , apartheid ended . There is more democracy . We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio . We have cut extreme poverty drastically . We have cut infant mortality by an enormous amount . Now , I say all these things not to make you complacent . We have got a bunch of big problems to solve . But I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history . And the reason America is better is because we did not look backwards we did not fear the future . We seized the future and made it our own . And that is exactly why it is always been young people like you that have brought about big change because you do not fear the future . That leads me to my second point The world is more interconnected than ever before , and it is becoming more connected every day . Building walls will not change that . Look , as President , my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States . And as citizens , we all rightly put our country first . But if the past two decades have taught us anything , it is that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation . When overseas states start falling apart , they become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores . When developing countries do not have functioning health systems , epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans , too . And a wall will not stop that . If we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes , we have got to have the cooperation of other countries in a global financial system to help enforce financial laws . The point is , to help ourselves we have got to help others not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out . And engagement does not just mean deploying our military . There are times where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our allies , and we are in awe of and we are grateful for the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known . But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military , and the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing . They cannot shoulder the entire burden . And engagement means using all the levers of our national power , and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges . You look at something like trade , for example . We live in an age of global supply chains , and cargo ships that crisscross oceans , and online commerce that can render borders obsolete . And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed that is one of the changes that is been taking place jobs shipped overseas , trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage . But the answer is not to stop trading with other countries . In this global economy , that is not even possible . The answer is to do trade the right way , by negotiating with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their environmental standards and we make sure they do not impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual property . That is how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values including human rights . And ultimately , that is how we help raise wages here in America . That is how we help our workers compete on a level playing field . Building walls will not do that . It will not boost our economy , and it will not enhance our security either . Isolating or disparaging Muslims , suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country that is not just a betrayal of our values that is not just a betrayal of who we are , it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism . Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders , and blame our challenges on immigrants that does not just run counter to our history as the world s melting pot it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe . That is how we became America . Why would we want to stop it now Cannot do it . Which brings me to my third point Facts , evidence , reason , logic , an understanding of science these are good things . These are qualities you want in people making policy . These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens . That might seem obvious . That is why we honor Bill Moyers or Burnell . We traditionally have valued those things . But if you were listening to today s political debate , you might wonder where this strain of anti intellectualism came from . So , Class of 2016 , let me be as clear as I can be . In politics and in life , ignorance is not a virtue . It is not cool to not know what you are talking about . That is not keeping it real , or telling it like it is . That is not challenging political correctness . That is just not knowing what you are talking about . And yet , we have become confused about this . Look , our nation s Founders Franklin , Madison , Hamilton , Jefferson they were born of the Enlightenment . They sought to escape superstition , and sectarianism , and tribalism , and no nothingness . They believed in rational thought and experimentation , and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates . That is embedded in our constitutional design . That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers , the Edisons and the Wright Brothers , and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers , and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses . That is what built this country . And today , in every phone in one of your pockets we have access to more information than at any time in human history , at a touch of a button . But , ironically , the flood of information has not made us more discerning of the truth . In some ways , it is just made us more confident in our ignorance . We assume whatever is on the web must be true . We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions . Opinions masquerade as facts . The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel . Now , understand , I am sure you have learned during your years of college and if not , you will learn soon that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense . That is the truth . You will meet them if you have not already . So the fact that they have got a fancy degree you got to talk to them to see whether they know what they are talking about . Qualities like kindness and compassion , honesty , hard work they often matter more than technical skills or know how . But when our leaders express a disdain for facts , when they are not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up , while actual experts are dismissed as elitists , then we have got a problem . You know , it is interesting that if we get sick , we actually want to make sure the doctors have gone to medical school , they know what they are talking about . If we get on a plane , we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane . And yet , in our public lives , we certainly think , I do not want somebody who is done it before . The rejection of facts , the rejection of reason and science that is the path to decline . It calls to mind the words of Carl Sagan , who graduated high school here in New Jersey he said We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers , our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good . The debate around climate change is a perfect example of this . Now , I recognize it does not feel like the planet is warmer right now . I understand . There was hail when I landed in Newark . But think about the climate change issue . Every day , there are officials in high office with responsibilities who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world s scientists that human activities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substances are altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways . A while back , you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as proof that the world was not warming . I mean , listen , climate change is not something subject to political spin . There is evidence . There are facts . We can see it happening right now . If we do not act , if we do not follow through on the progress we made in Paris , the progress we have been making here at home , your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe . So it is up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate . Imagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball , what he would think . Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that . He had get a And he is a senator Look , I am not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion , or faith , or love , or loyalty . I am suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well , and proposed budgets add up , and our environment is protected . And to accomplish those things , to make collective decisions on behalf of a common good , we have to use our heads . We have to agree that facts and evidence matter . And we got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they are talking about . All right . I only have two more points . I know it is getting cold and you guys have to graduate . Point four Have faith in democracy . Look , I know it is not always pretty . Really , I know . I have been living it . But it is how , bit by bit , generation by generation , we have made progress in this nation . That is how we banned child labor . That is how we cleaned up our air and our water . That is how we passed programs like Social Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty . None of these changes happened overnight . They did not happen because some charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything . It did not happen because some massive political revolution occurred . It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy , and organizing , and alliance building , and deal making , and the changing of public opinion . It happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political process . Well , that is nice . I mean , I helped , but Look , if you want to change this country for the better , you better start participating . I will give you an example on a lot of people s minds right now and that is the growing inequality in our economy . Over much of the last century , we have unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen , but over the past few decades , our economy has become more and more unequal . The top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all income in the In the past , it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the average worker . Today , it is 300 times more . And wages are not rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families . Now , if we want to reverse those trends , there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference . We can raise the minimum wage . We can modernize our infrastructure . We can invest in early childhood education . We can make college more affordable . We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement . And if we did these things , then we had help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody . Now , the reason some of these things have not happened , even though the majority of people approve of them , is really simple . It is not because I was not proposing them . It was not because the facts and the evidence showed they would not work . It was because a huge chunk of Americans , especially young people , do not vote . In 2014 , voter turnout was the lowest since World War IFewer than one in five young people showed up to vote 2014 . And the four who stayed home determined the course of this country just as much as the single one who voted . Because apathy has consequences . It determines who our Congress is . It determines what policies they prioritize . It even , for example , determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate . And , yes , big money in politics is a huge problem . We have got to reduce its influence . Yes , special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corridors of power . But , contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right , the system is not as rigged as you think , and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think . Politicians care about being elected , and they especially care about being reelected . And if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views , you will get what you want . And if you opt out , or stop paying attention , you will not . It is that simple . It is not that complicated . Now , one of the reasons that people do not vote is because they do not see the changes they were looking for right away . Well , guess what none of the great strides in our history happened right away . It took Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v . Board of Education and then another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act . And it took more time after that for it to start working . It took a proud daughter of New Jersey , Alice Paul , years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests , and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation , and writing letters and giving speeches , and working with congressional leaders before she and other suffragettes finally helped win women the right to vote . Each stage along the way required compromise . Sometimes you took half a loaf . You forged allies . Sometimes you lost on an issue , and then you came back to fight another day . That is how democracy works . So you have got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification , but you got to be a citizen full time , all the time . And if participation means voting , and it means compromise , and organizing and advocacy , it also means listening to those who do not agree with you . I know a couple years ago , folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement . Now , I do not think it is a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Rice and the previous administration . But the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State , or shutting out what she had to say I believe that is misguided . I do not think that is how democracy works best , when we are not even willing to listen to each other . I believe that is misguided . If you disagree with somebody , bring them in and ask them tough questions . Hold their feet to the fire . Make them defend their positions . If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea , prove it wrong . Engage it . Debate it . Stand up for what you believe in . Do not be scared to take somebody on . Do not feel like you got to shut your ears off because you are too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities . Go at them if they are not making any sense . Use your logic and reason and words . And by doing so , you will strengthen your own position , and you will hone your arguments . And maybe you will learn something and realize you do not know everything . And you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe . Either way , you win . And more importantly , our democracy wins . So , anyway , all right . That is it , Class of 2016 a few suggestions on how you can change the world . Except maybe I have got one last suggestion . Just one . And that is , gear yourself for the long haul . Whatever path you choose business , nonprofits , government , education , health care , the arts whatever it is , you are going to have some setbacks . You will deal occasionally with foolish people . You will be frustrated . You will have a boss that is not great . You will not always get everything you want at least not as fast as you want it . So you have to stick with it . You have to be persistent . And success , however small , however incomplete , success is still success . I always tell my daughters , you know , better is good . It may not be perfect , it may not be great , but it is good . That is how progress happens in societies and in our own lives . So do not lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock . Do not lose hope in the face of naysayers . And certainly do not let resistance make you cynical . Cynicism is so easy , and cynics do not accomplish much . As a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey , a guy named Bruce Springsteen , once sang they spend their lives waiting for a moment that just do not come . Do not let that be you . Do not waste your time waiting . If you doubt you can make a difference , look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already making . Look at what Matthew is doing . Look at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan , who began organizing anti bullying assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination , and here at Rutgers , helped found the Muslim Public Relations Council to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion . Look at somebody like Madison Little , who grew up dealing with some health issues , and started wondering what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else , and so , here at Rutgers , he took charge of a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to address the AIDS epidemic . Our generation has so much energy to adapt and impact the world , he said . My peers give me a lot of hope that we will overcome the obstacles we face in society . That is you Is it any wonder that I am optimistic Throughout our history , a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom , and more opportunity , and more justice . And , Class of 2016 , it is your turn now to shape our nation s destiny , as well as your own . So get to work . Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last . Good luck . God bless you . God bless this country we love . Thank you .<speech_sep>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation With profound gratitude and great humility , I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States . Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours Hillary Rodham Clinton . To President Clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it to Ted Kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service and to the next Vice President of the United States , Joe Biden , I thank you . I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night . To the love of my life , our next First Lady , Michelle Obama , and to Sasha and Malia I love you so much , and I am so proud of all of you . Four years ago , I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who were not well off or well known , but shared a belief that in America , their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to . It is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well . That is why I stand here tonight . Because for two hundred and thirty two years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive . We meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the American promise has been threatened once more . Tonight , more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less . More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet . More of you have cars you cannot afford to drive , credit card bills you cannot afford to pay , and tuition that is beyond your reach . These challenges are not all of government s making . But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George Bush . America , we are better than these last eight years . We are a better country than this . This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work . This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he is worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news . We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes . Tonight , I say to the American people , to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land enough This moment this election is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the American promise alive . Because next week , in Minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third . And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight . On November 4th , we must stand up and say Eight is enough . Now let there be no doubt . The Republican nominee , John McCain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect . And next week , we will also hear about those occasions when he is broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need . But the record s clear John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time . Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment , but really , what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time I do not know about you , but I am not ready to take a ten percent chance on change . The truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy Senator McCain has been anything but independent . He said that our economy has made great progress under this President . He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong . And when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession , and that we have become , and I quote , a nation of whiners . A nation of whiners Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made . Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty . These are not whiners . They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint . These are the Americans that I know . Now , I do not believe that Senator McCain does not care what is going on in the lives of Americans . I just think he does not know . Why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people s benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement It is not because John McCain does not care . It is because John McCain does not get it . For over two decades , he is subscribed to that old , discredited Republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else . In Washington , they call this the Ownership Society , but what it really means is you are on your own . Out of work Tough luck . No health care The market will fix it . Born into poverty Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you do not have boots . You are on your own . Well it is time for them to own their failure . It is time for us to change America . You see , we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country . We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma . We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President when the average American family saw its income go up 7 , 500 instead of down 2 , 000 like it has under George Bush . We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work . The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight . Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan , I see my grandfather , who signed up after Pearl Harbor , marched in Patton s Army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill . In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , I think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships . When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed . And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , I think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman . She is the one who taught me about hard work . She is the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life . She poured everything she had into me . And although she can no longer travel , I know that she is watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well . I do not know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine . These are my heroes . Theirs are the stories that shaped me . And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States . What is that promise It is a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect . It is a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs , look out for American workers , and play by the rules of the road . Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology . Our government should work for us , not against us . It should help us , not hurt us . It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every American who is willing to work . That is the promise of America the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that I am my brother s keeper I am my sister s keeper . That is the promise we need to keep . That is the change we need right now . So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President . Change means a tax code that does not reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it . Unlike John McCain , I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America . I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage , high tech jobs of tomorrow . I will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families . Because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class . And for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , I will set a clear goal as President in ten years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East . Washington s been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years , and John McCain has been there for twenty six of them . In that time , he is said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels . And today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office . Now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure , not a long term solution . Not even close . As President , I will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power . I will help our auto companies re tool , so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in America . I will make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars . And I will invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cannot ever be outsourced . America , now is not the time for small plans . Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy . Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education . And I will not settle for an America where some kids do not have that chance . I will invest in early childhood education . I will recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support . And in exchange , I will ask for higher standards and more accountability . And we will keep our promise to every young American if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education . Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single American . If you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums . If you do not , you will be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves . And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most . Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent . Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses and the time to protect Social Security for future generations . And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day s work , because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons . Now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why I have laid out how I will pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do not help America grow . But I will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy . And Democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling America s promise will require more than just money . It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John Kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength . Yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient . Yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair . But we must also admit that programs alone cannot replace parents that government cannot turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need . Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that is the essence of America s promise . And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep America s promise abroad . If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next Commander in Chief , that is a debate I am ready to have . For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9 11 , I stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face . When John McCain said we could just muddle through in Afghanistan , I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 , and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights . John McCain likes to say that he will follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell but he will not even go to the cave where he lives . And today , as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration , even after we learned that Iraq has a 79 billion surplus while we are wallowing in deficits , John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war . That is not the judgment we need . That will not keep America safe . We need a President who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past . You do not defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq . You do not protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington . You cannot truly stand up for Georgia when you have strained our oldest alliances . If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice but it is not the change we need . We are the party of Roosevelt . We are the party of Kennedy . So do not tell me that Democrats will not defend this country . Do not tell me that Democrats will not keep us safe . The Bush McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans Democrats and Republicans have built , and we are here to restore that legacy . As Commander in Chief , I will never hesitate to defend this nation , but I will only send our troops into harm s way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home . I will end this war in Iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan . I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts . But I will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression . I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease . And I will restore our moral standing , so that America is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future . These are the policies I will pursue . And in the weeks ahead , I look forward to debating them with John McCain . But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes . Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other s character and patriotism . The times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook . So let us agree that patriotism has no party . I love this country , and so do you , and so does John McCain . The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag . They have not served a Red America or a Blue America they have served the United States of America . So I have got news for you , John McCain . We all put our country first . America , our work will not be easy . The challenges we face require tough choices , and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past . For part of what has been lost these past eight years cannot just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits . What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose . And that is what we have to restore . We may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country . The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland , but do not tell me we cannot uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK 47s out of the hands of criminals . I know there are differences on same sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination . Passions fly on immigration , but I do not know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers . This too is part of America s promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort . I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk . They claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values . And that is to be expected . Because if you do not have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters . If you do not have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from . You make a big election about small things . And you know what it is worked before . Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government . When Washington does not work , all its promises seem empty . If your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it is best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know . I get it . I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office . I do not fit the typical pedigree , and I have not spent my career in the halls of Washington . But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring . What the nay sayers do not understand is that this election has never been about me . It is been about you . For eighteen long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past . You understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result . You have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does not come from Washington . Change comes to Washington . Change happens because the American people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time . America , this is one of those moments . I believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming . Because I have seen it . Because I have lived it . I have seen it in Illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work . I have seen it in Washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands . And I have seen it in this campaign . In the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time . In the Republicans who never thought they had pick up a Democratic ballot , but did . I have seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise . This country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that is not what makes us rich . We have the most powerful military on Earth , but that is not what makes us strong . Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that is not what keeps the world coming to our shores . Instead , it is that American spirit that American promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend . That promise is our greatest inheritance . It is a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot . And it is that promise that forty five years ago today , brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington , before Lincoln s Memorial , and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream . The men and women who gathered there could have heard many things . They could have heard words of anger and discord . They could have been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred . But what the people heard instead people of every creed and color , from every walk of life is that in America , our destiny is inextricably linked . That together , our dreams can be one . We cannot walk alone , the preacher cried . And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead . We cannot turn back . America , we cannot turn back . Not with so much work to be done . Not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for . Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save . Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend . America , we cannot turn back . We cannot walk alone . At this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future . Let us keep that promise that American promise and in the words of Scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess . Thank you , God Bless you , and God Bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>President , Secretary General , my fellow delegates , ladies and gentlemen . It is a great honor to address this Assembly for the second time , nearly two years after my election as President of the United States . We know this is no ordinary time for our people . Each of us comes here with our own problems and priorities . But there are also challenges that we share in common as leaders and as nations . We meet within an institution built from the rubble of war , designed to unite the world in pursuit of peace . And we meet within a city that for centuries has welcomed people from across the globe , demonstrating that individuals of every color , faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity , build a community , and live with the blessing of human liberty . Outside the doors of this hall , the blocks and neighborhoods of this great city tell the story of a difficult decade . Nine years ago , the destruction of the World Trade Center signaled a threat that respected no boundary of dignity or decency . Two years ago this month , a financial crisis on Wall Street devastated American families on Main Street . These separate challenges have affected people around the globe . Men and women and children have been murdered by extremists from Casablanca to London from Jalalabad to Jakarta . The global economy suffered an enormous blow during the financial crisis , crippling markets and deferring the dreams of millions on every continent . Underneath these challenges to our security and prosperity lie deeper fears that ancient hatreds and religious divides are once again ascendant that a world which has grown more interconnected has somehow slipped beyond our control . These are some of the challenges that my administration has confronted since we came into office . And today , I had like to talk to you about what we have done over the last 20 months to meet these challenges what our responsibility is to pursue peace in the Middle East and what kind of world we are trying to build in this 21st century . Let me begin with what we have done . I have had no greater focus as President than rescuing our economy from potential catastrophe . And in an age when prosperity is shared , we could not do this alone . So America has joined with nations around the world to spur growth , and the renewed demand that could restart job creation . We are reforming our system of global finance , beginning with Wall Street reform here at home , so that a crisis like this never happens again . And we made the G20 the focal point for international coordination , because in a world where prosperity is more diffuse , we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerging economies economies from every corner of the globe . There is much to show for our efforts , even as there is much work to be done . The global economy has been pulled back from the brink of a depression , and is growing once more . We have resisted protectionism , and are exploring ways to expand trade and commerce among nations . But we cannot and will not rest until these seeds of progress grow into a broader prosperity , not only for all Americans , but for peoples around the globe . As for our common security , America is waging a more effective fight against al Qaeda , while winding down the war in Iraq . Since I took office , the United States has removed nearly 100 , 000 troops from Iraq . We have done so responsibly , as Iraqis have transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of their country . We are now focused on building a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people , while keeping our commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the end of next year . While drawing down in Iraq , we have refocused on defeating al Qaeda and denying its affiliates a safe haven . In Afghanistan , the United States and our allies are pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban s momentum and build the capacity of Afghanistan s government and security forces , so that a transition to Afghan responsibility can begin next July . And from South Asia to the Horn of Africa , we are moving toward a more targeted approach one that strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist networks without deploying large American armies . As we pursue the world s most dangerous extremists , we are also denying them the world s most dangerous weapons , and pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons . Earlier this year , 47 nations embraced a work plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years . We have joined with Russia to sign the most comprehensive arms control treaty in decades . We have reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy . And here , at the United Nations , we came together to strengthen the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty . As part of our effort on non proliferation , I offered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended hand last year , and underscored that it has both rights and responsibilities as a member of the international community . I also said in this hall that Iran must be held accountable if it failed to meet those responsibilities . And that is what we have done . Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear program , and those actions have consequences . Through Security Council Resolution 1929 , we made it clear that international law is not an empty promise . Now let me be clear once more The United States and the international community seek a resolution to our differences with Iran , and the door remains open to diplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it . But the Iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program . As we combat the spread of deadly weapons , we are also confronting the specter of climate change . After making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at home , we helped forge an accord in Copenhagen that for the first time commits all major economies to reduce their emissions . We are keenly aware this is just a first step . And going forward , we will support a process in which all major economies meet our responsibilities to protect the planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development . America has also embraced unique responsibilities with come that come with our power . Since the rains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan , we have pledged our assistance , and we should all support the Pakistani people as they recover and rebuild . And when the earth shook and Haiti was devastated by loss , we joined a coalition of nations in response . Today , we honor those from the family who lost their lives in the earthquake , and commit ourselves to stand with the people of Haiti until they can stand on their own two feet . Amidst this upheaval , we have also been persistent in our pursuit of peace . Last year , I pledged my best efforts to support the goal of two states , Israel and Palestine , living side by side in peace and security , as part of a comprehensive peace between Israel and all of its neighbors . We have travelled a winding road over the last 12 months , with few peaks and many valleys . But this month , I am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington , Sharm el Sheikh and Jerusalem . Now I recognize many are pessimistic about this process . The cynics say that Israelis and Palestinians are too distrustful of each other , and too divided internally , to forge lasting peace . Rejectionists on both sides will try to disrupt the process , with bitter words and with bombs and with gunfire . Some say that the gaps between the parties are too big the potential for talks to break down is too great and that after decades of failure , peace is simply not possible . I hear those voices of skepticism . But I ask you to consider the alternative . If an agreement is not reached , Palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that comes with their own state . Israelis will never know the certainty and security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbors who are committed to coexistence . The hard realities of demography will take hold . More blood will be shed . This Holy Land will remain a symbol of our differences , instead of our common humanity . I refuse to accept that future . And we all have a choice to make . Each of us must choose the path of peace . Of course , that responsibility begins with the parties themselves , who must answer the call of history . Earlier this month at the White House , I was struck by the words of both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders . Prime Minister Netanyahu said , I came here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace , security , and dignity . And President Abbas said , We will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause . These words must now be followed by action and I believe that both leaders have the courage to do so . But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly difficult , which is why I call upon Israelis and Palestinians and the world to rally behind the goal that these leaders now share . We know that there will be tests along the way and that one test is fast approaching . Israel s settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks . And our position on this issue is well known . We believe that the moratorium should be extended . We also believe that talks should press on until completed . Now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this obstacle . Now is the time to build the trust and provide the time for substantial progress to be made . Now is the time for this opportunity to be seized , so that it does not slip away . Now , peace must be made by Israelis and Palestinians , but each of us has a responsibility to do our part as well . Those of us who are friends of Israel must understand that true security for the Jewish state requires an independent Palestine one that allows the Palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity . And those of us who are friends of the Palestinians must understand that the rights of the Palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means including genuine reconciliation with a secure Israel . I know many in this hall count themselves as friends of the Palestinians . But these pledges of friendship must now be supported by deeds . Those who have signed on to the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps towards the normalization that it promises Israel . And those who speak on behalf of Palestinian self government should help the Palestinian Authority politically and financially , and in doing so help the Palestinians build the institutions of their state . Those who long to see an independent Palestine must also stop trying to tear down Israel . After thousands of years , Jews and Arabs are not strangers in a strange land . After 60 years in the community of nations , Israel s existence must not be a subject for debate . Israel is a sovereign state , and the historic homeland of the Jewish people . It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel s legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States . And efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian people . The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance it is injustice . And make no mistake The courage of a man like President Abbas , who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances , is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children . The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old as this institution . And we can come back here next year , as we have for the last 60 years , and make long speeches about it . We can read familiar lists of grievances . We can table the same resolutions . We can further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate . And we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that will not help a single Israeli or Palestinian child achieve a better life . We can do that . Or , we can say that this time will be different that this time we will not let terror , or turbulence , or posturing , or petty politics stand in the way . This time , we will think not of ourselves , but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams , or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire . This time , we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see Jerusalem s soil as sacred . This time we should reach for what is best within ourselves . If we do , when we come back here next year , we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations an independent , sovereign state of Palestine , living in peace with Israel . It is our destiny to bear the burdens of the challenges that I have addressed recession and war and conflict . And there is always a sense of urgency even emergency that drives most of our foreign policies . Indeed , after millennia marked by wars , this very institution reflects the desire of human beings to create a forum to deal with emergencies that will inevitably come . But even as we confront immediate challenges , we must also summon the foresight to look beyond them , and consider what we are trying to build over the long term What is the world that awaits us when today s battles are brought to an end And that is what I would like to talk about with the remainder of my time today . One of the first actions of this General Assembly was to adopt a Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 . That Declaration begins by stating that , recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice , and peace in the world . The idea is a simple one that freedom , justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom , justice , and peace in the lives of individual human beings . And for the United States , this is a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity . As Robert Kennedy said , the individual man , the child of God , is the touchstone of value , and all society , groups , the state , exist for his benefit . So we stand up for universal values because it is the right thing to do . But we also know from experience that those who defend these values for their people have been our closest friends and allies , while those who have denied those rights whether terrorist groups or tyrannical governments have chosen to be our adversaries . Human rights have never gone unchallenged not in any of our nations , and not in our world . Tyranny is still with us whether it manifests itself in the Taliban killing girls who try to go to school , a North Korean regime that enslaves its own people , or an armed group in Congo Kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war . In times of economic unease , there can also be an anxiety about human rights . Today , as in past times of economic downturn , some put human rights aside for the promise of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom . We see leaders abolishing term limits . We see crackdowns on civil society . We see corruption smothering entrepreneurship and good governance . We see democratic reforms deferred indefinitely . As I said last year , each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its own people . Yet experience shows us that history is on the side of liberty that the strongest foundation for human progress lies in open economies , open societies , and open governments . To put it simply , democracy , more than any other form of government , delivers for our citizens . And I believe that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the borders between nations are blurred . America is working to shape a world that fosters this openness , for the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings . All of us want the right to educate our children , to make a decent wage , to care for the sick , and to be carried as far as our dreams and our deeds will take us . But that depends upon economies that tap the power of our people , including the potential of women and girls . That means letting entrepreneurs start a business without paying a bribe and governments that support opportunity instead of stealing from their people . And that means rewarding hard work , instead of reckless risk taking . Yesterday , I put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goals , recognizing that dignity is a human right and global development is in our common interest . America will partner with nations that offer their people a path out of poverty . And together , we must unleash growth that powers by individuals and emerging markets in all parts of the globe . There is no reason why Africa should not be an exporter of agriculture , which is why our food security initiative is empowering farmers . There is no reason why entrepreneurs should not be able to build new markets in every society , which is why I hosted a summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring , because the obligation of government is to empower individuals , not to impede them . The same holds true for civil society . The arc of human progress has been shaped by individuals with the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside of government that insisted upon democratic change and by free media that held the powerful accountable . We have seen that from the South Africans who stood up to apartheid , to the Poles of Solidarity , to the mothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the Dirty War , to Americans who marched for the rights of all races , including my own . Civil society is the conscience of our communities and America will always extend our engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of government . And we will call out those who suppress ideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless . We will promote new tools of communication so people are empowered to connect with one another and , in repressive societies , to do so with security . We will support a free and open Internet , so individuals have the information to make up their own minds . And it is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms that advance the rights of civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across borders . Open society supports open government , but it cannot substitute for it . There is no right more fundamental than the ability to choose your leaders and determine your destiny . Now , make no mistake The ultimate success of democracy in the world will not come because the United States dictates it it will come because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed . There is no soil where this notion cannot take root , just as every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation . Later this fall , I will travel to Asia . And I will visit India , which peacefully threw off colonialism and established a thriving democracy of over a billion people . I will continue to Indonesia , the world s largest Muslim majority country , which binds together thousands of islands through the glue of representative government and civil society . I will join the G20 meeting on the Korean Peninsula , which provides the world s clearest contrast between a society that is dynamic and open and free , and one that is imprisoned and closed . And I will conclude my trip in Japan , an ancient culture that found peace and extraordinary development through democracy . Each of these countries gives life to democratic principles in their own way . And even as some governments roll back reform , we also celebrate the courage of a President in Colombia who willingly stepped aside , or the promise of a new constitution in Kenya . The common thread of progress is the principle that government is accountable to its citizens . And the diversity in this room makes clear no one country has all the answers , but all of us must answer to our own people . In all parts of the world , we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable . And now , we must build on that progress . And when we gather back here next year , we should bring specific commitments to promote transparency to fight corruption to energize civic engagement to leverage new technologies so that we strengthen the foundations of freedom in our own countries , while living up to the ideals that can light the world . This institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights . It is time to welcome the efforts of Women to protect the rights of women around the globe . It is time for every member state to open its elections to international monitors and increase the Democracy Fund . It is time to reinvigorate peacekeeping , so that missions have the resources necessary to succeed , and so atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and justice is enforced because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security . And it is time to make this institution more accountable as well , because the challenges of a new century demand new ways of serving our common interests . The world that America seeks is not one we can build on our own . For human rights to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression , we need your voices to speak out . In particular , I appeal to those nations who emerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the second half of the last century from South Africa to South Asia from Eastern Europe to South America . Do not stand idly by , do not be silent , when dissidents elsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten . Recall your own history . Because part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others . That belief will guide America s leadership in this 21st century . It is a belief that has seen us through more than two centuries of trial , and it will see us through the challenges we face today be it war or recession conflict or division . So even as we have come through a difficult decade , I stand here before you confident in the future a future where Iraq is governed by neither tyrant nor a foreign power , and Afghanistan is freed from the turmoil of war a future where the children of Israel and Palestine can build the peace that was not possible for their parents a world where the promise of development reaches into the prisons of poverty and disease a future where the cloud of recession gives way to the light of renewal and the dream of opportunity is available to all . This future will not be easy to reach . It will not come without setbacks , nor will it be quickly claimed . But the founding of the United Nations itself is a testament to human progress . Remember , in times that were far more trying than our own , our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and equality of human beings would be our common cause . It falls to us to fulfill that promise . And though we will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve , Americans have always had cause to believe that we can choose a better history that we need only to look outside the walls around us . For through the citizens of every conceivable ancestry who make this city their own , we see living proof that opportunity can be accessed by all , that what unites us as human beings is far greater than what divides us , and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Vice President Biden , Chief Justice , members of the United States Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution . We affirm the promise of our democracy . We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names . What makes us exceptional what makes us American is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Today we continue a never ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time . For history tells us that while these truths may be self evident , they have never been self executing that while freedom is a gift from God , it must be secured by His people here on Earth . The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob . They gave to us a republic , a government of , and by , and for the people , entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed . And for more than two hundred years , we have . Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword , we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half slave and half free . We made ourselves anew , and vowed to move forward together . Together , we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce , schools and colleges to train our workers . Together , we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play . Together , we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable , and protect its people from life s worst hazards and misfortune . Through it all , we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority , nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society s ills can be cured through government alone . Our celebration of initiative and enterprise , our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility , these are constants in our character . But we have always understood that when times change , so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action . For the American people can no more meet the demands of today s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias . No single person can train all the math and science teachers we will need to equip our children for the future , or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores . Now , more than ever , we must do these things together , as one nation and one people . This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience . A decade of war is now ending . An economic recovery has begun . America s possibilities are limitless , for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands youth and drive diversity and openness an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention . My fellow Americans , we are made for this moment , and we will seize it so long as we seize it together . For we , the people , understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it . We believe that America s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class . We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship . We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else , because she is an American she is free , and she is equal , not just in the eyes of God but also in our own . We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time . So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government , revamp our tax code , reform our schools , and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder , learn more , reach higher . But while the means will change , our purpose endures a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American . That is what this moment requires . That is what will give real meaning to our creed . We , the people , still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity . We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit . But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future . For we remember the lessons of our past , when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn . We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky , or happiness for the few . We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives , any one of us at any time may face a job loss , or a sudden illness , or a home swept away in a terrible storm . The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security , these things do not sap our initiative , they strengthen us . They do not make us a nation of takers they free us to take the risks that make this country great . We , the people , still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves , but to all posterity . We will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations . Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science , but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms . The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult . But America cannot resist this transition , we must lead it . We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries , we must claim its promise . That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure our forests and waterways , our crop lands and snow capped peaks . That is how we will preserve our planet , commanded to our care by God . That is what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared . We , the people , still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war . Our brave men and women in uniform , tempered by the flames of battle , are unmatched in skill and courage . Our citizens , seared by the memory of those we have lost , know too well the price that is paid for liberty . The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm . But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends and we must carry those lessons into this time as well . We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law . We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully not because we are na iuml ve about the dangers we face , but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear . America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe . And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad , for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation . We will support democracy from Asia to Africa , from the Americas to the Middle East , because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom . And we must be a source of hope to the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the victims of prejudice not out of mere charity , but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes tolerance and opportunity , human dignity and justice . We , the people , declare today that the most evident of truths that all of us are created equal is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls , and Selma , and Stonewall just as it guided all those men and women , sung and unsung , who left footprints along this great Mall , to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth . It is now our generation s task to carry on what those pioneers began . For our journey is not complete until our wives , our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts . Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well . Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote . Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country . Our journey is not complete until all our children , from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia , to the quiet lanes of Newtown , know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm . That is our generation s task to make these words , these rights , these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American . Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life . It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness . Progress does not compel us to settle centuries long debates about the role of government for all time , but it does require us to act in our time . For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay . We cannot mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name calling as reasoned debate . We must act , knowing that our work will be imperfect . We must act , knowing that today s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall . My fellow Americans , the oath I have sworn before you today , like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol , was an oath to God and country , not party or faction . And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service . But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream . My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride . They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope . You and as citizens , have the power to set this country s course . You and as citizens , have the obligation to shape the debates of our time not only with the votes we cast , but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals . Let us , each of us , now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright . With common effort and common purpose , with passion and dedication , let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom . Thank you . God bless you , and may He forever bless these United States of America .<speech_sep>Giving all praise and honor to God . The Bible calls us to hope . To persevere , and have faith in things not seen . They were still living by faith when they died , Scripture tells us . They did not receive the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance , admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on Earth . We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith . A man who believed in things not seen . A man who believed there were better days ahead , off in the distance . A man of service who persevered , knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised , because he believed his efforts would deliver a better life for those who followed . To Jennifer , his beloved wife to Eliana and Malana , his beautiful , wonderful daughters to the Mother Emanuel family and the people of Charleston , the people of South Carolina . I cannot claim to have the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well . But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina , back when we were both a little bit younger . Back when I did not have visible grey hair . The first thing I noticed was his graciousness , his smile , his reassuring baritone , his deceptive sense of humor all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation . Friends of his remarked this week that when Clementa Pinckney entered a room , it was like the future arrived that even from a young age , folks knew he was special . Anointed . He was the progeny of a long line of the faithful a family of preachers who spread God s word , a family of protesters who sowed change to expand voting rights and desegregate the South . Clem heard their instruction , and he did not forsake their teaching . He was in the pulpit by 13 , pastor by 18 , public servant by 23 . He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth , nor youth s insecurities instead , he set an example worthy of his position , wise beyond his years , in his speech , in his conduct , in his love , faith , and purity . As a senator , he represented a sprawling swath of the Lowcountry , a place that has long been one of the most neglected in America . A place still wracked by poverty and inadequate schools a place where children can still go hungry and the sick can go without treatment . A place that needed somebody like Clem . His position in the minority party meant the odds of winning more resources for his constituents were often long . His calls for greater equity were too often unheeded , the votes he cast were sometimes lonely . But he never gave up . He stayed true to his convictions . He would not grow discouraged . After a full day at the capitol , he had climb into his car and head to the church to draw sustenance from his family , from his ministry , from the community that loved and needed him . There he would fortify his faith , and imagine what might be . Reverend Pinckney embodied a politics that was neither mean , nor small . He conducted himself quietly , and kindly , and diligently . He encouraged progress not by pushing his ideas alone , but by seeking out your ideas , partnering with you to make things happen . He was full of empathy and fellow feeling , able to walk in somebody else s shoes and see through their eyes . No wonder one of his senate colleagues remembered Senator Pinckney as the most gentle of the 46 of us the best of the 46 of us . Clem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant . But the person who asked probably did not know the history of the AME church . As our brothers and sisters in the AME church know , we do not make those distinctions . Our calling , Clem once said , is not just within the walls of the congregation , but hellip the life and community in which our congregation resides . He embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words that the sweet hour of prayer actually lasts the whole week long that to put our faith in action is more than individual salvation , it is about our collective salvation that to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and house the homeless is not just a call for isolated charity but the imperative of a just society . What a good man . Sometimes I think that is the best thing to hope for when you are eulogized after all the words and recitations and resumes are read , to just say someone was a good man . You do not have to be of high station to be a good man . Preacher by 13 . Pastor by 18 . Public servant by 23 . What a life Clementa Pinckney lived . What an example he set . What a model for his faith . And then to lose him at 41 slain in his sanctuary with eight wonderful members of his flock , each at different stages in life but bound together by a common commitment to God . Cynthia Hurd . Susie Jackson . Ethel Lance . DePayne Middleton Doctor . Tywanza Sanders . Daniel Simmons . Sharonda Coleman Singleton . Myra Thompson . Good people . Decent people . God fearing people . People so full of life and so full of kindness . People who ran the race , who persevered . People of great faith . To the families of the fallen , the nation shares in your grief . Our pain cuts that much deeper because it happened in a church . The church is and always has been the center of African American life a place to call our own in a too often hostile world , a sanctuary from so many hardships . Over the course of centuries , black churches served as hush harbors where slaves could worship in safety praise houses where their free descendants could gather and shout hallelujah rest stops for the weary along the Underground Railroad bunkers for the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement . They have been , and continue to be , community centers where we organize for jobs and justice places of scholarship and network places where children are loved and fed and kept out of harm s way , and told that they are beautiful and smart and taught that they matter . That is what happens in church . That is what the black church means . Our beating heart . The place where our dignity as a people is inviolate . When there is no better example of this tradition than Mother Emanuel a church built by blacks seeking liberty , burned to the ground because its founder sought to end slavery , only to rise up again , a Phoenix from these ashes . When there were laws banning all black church gatherings , services happened here anyway , in defiance of unjust laws . When there was a righteous movement to dismantle Jim Crow , Martin Luther King , preached from its pulpit , and marches began from its steps . A sacred place , this church . Not just for blacks , not just for Christians , but for every American who cares about the steady expansion of human rights and human dignity in this country a foundation stone for liberty and justice for all . That is what the church meant . We do not know whether the killer of Reverend Pinckney and eight others knew all of this history . But he surely sensed the meaning of his violent act . It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches , not random , but as a means of control , a way to terrorize and oppress . An act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination violence and suspicion . An act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation s original sin . Oh , but God works in mysterious ways . God has different ideas . He did not know he was being used by God . Blinded by hatred , the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle . The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court in the midst of unspeakable grief , with words of forgiveness . He could not imagine that . The alleged killer could not imagine how the city of Charleston , under the good and wise leadership of Mayor Riley how the state of South Carolina , how the United States of America would respond not merely with revulsion at his evil act , but with big hearted generosity and , more importantly , with a thoughtful introspection and self examination that we so rarely see in public life . Blinded by hatred , he failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood the power of God s grace . This whole week , I have been reflecting on this idea of grace . The grace of the families who lost loved ones . The grace that Reverend Pinckney would preach about in his sermons . The grace described in one of my favorite hymnals the one we all know Amazing grace , how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me . I once was lost , but now I am found was blind but now I see . According to the Christian tradition , grace is not earned . Grace is not merited . It is not something we deserve . Rather , grace is the free and benevolent favor of God as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings . Grace . As a nation , out of this terrible tragedy , God has visited grace upon us , for he has allowed us to see where we have been blind . He has given us the chance , where we have been lost , to find our best selves . We may not have earned it , this grace , with our rancor and complacency , and short sightedness and fear of each other but we got it all the same . He gave it to us anyway . He is once more given us grace . But it is up to us now to make the most of it , to receive it with gratitude , and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift . For too long , we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens . It is true , a flag did not cause these murders . But as people from all walks of life , Republicans and Democrats , now acknowledge including Governor Haley , whose recent eloquence on the subject is worthy of praise as we all have to acknowledge , the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride . For many , black and white , that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation . We see that now . Removing the flag from this state s capitol would not be an act of political correctness it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers . It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought the cause of slavery was wrong the imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War , the resistance to civil rights for all people was wrong . It would be one step in an honest accounting of America s history a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds . It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this state and this country for the better , because of the work of so many people of goodwill , people of all races striving to form a more perfect union . By taking down that flag , we express God s grace . But I do not think God wants us to stop there . For too long , we have been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present . Perhaps we see that now . Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty , or attend dilapidated schools , or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career . Perhaps it causes us to examine what we are doing to cause some of our children to hate . Perhaps it softens hearts towards those lost young men , tens and tens of thousands caught up in the criminal justice system and leads us to make sure that that system is not infected with bias that we embrace changes in how we train and equip our police so that the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve make us all safer and more secure . Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we do not realize it , so that we are guarding against not just racial slurs , but we are also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal . So that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote . By recognizing our common humanity by treating every child as important , regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born , and to do what is necessary to make opportunity real for every American by doing that , we express God s grace . For too long For too long , we have been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation . Sporadically , our eyes are open When eight of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement , 12 in a movie theater , 26 in an elementary school . But I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day the countless more whose lives are forever changed the survivors crippled , the children traumatized and fearful every day as they walk to school , the husband who will never feel his wife s warm touch , the entire communities whose grief overflows every time they have to watch what happened to them happen to some other place . The vast majority of Americans the majority of gun owners want to do something about this . We see that now . And I am convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others , even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country by making the moral choice to change , we express God s grace . We do not earn grace . We are all sinners . We do not deserve it . But God gives it to us anyway . And we choose how to receive it . It is our decision how to honor it . None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight . Every time something like this happens , somebody says we have to have a conversation about race . We talk a lot about race . There is no shortcut . And we do not need more talk . None of us should believe that a handful of gun safety measures will prevent every tragedy . It will not . People of goodwill will continue to debate the merits of various policies , as our democracy requires this is a big , raucous place , America is . And there are good people on both sides of these debates . Whatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete . But it would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for , I believe , if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again . Once the eulogies have been delivered , once the TV cameras move on , to go back to business as usual that is what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society . To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change that is how we lose our way again . It would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families if we merely slipped into old habits , whereby those who disagree with us are not merely wrong but bad where we shout instead of listen where we barricade ourselves behind preconceived notions or well practiced cynicism . Reverend Pinckney once said , Across the South , we have a deep appreciation of history we have not always had a deep appreciation of each other s history . What is true in the South is true for America . Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other . That my liberty depends on you being free , too . That history cannot be a sword to justify injustice , or a shield against progress , but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past how to break the cycle . A roadway toward a better world . He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind but , more importantly , an open heart . That is what I have felt this week an open heart . That , more than any particular policy or analysis , is what is called upon right now , I think what a friend of mine , the writer Marilyn Robinson , calls that reservoir of goodness , beyond , and of another kind , that we are able to do each other in the ordinary cause of things . That reservoir of goodness . If we can find that grace , anything is possible . If we can tap that grace , everything can change . Amazing grace . Amazing grace . Amazing grace how sweet the sound , that saved a wretch like me I once was lost , but now I am found was blind but now I see . Clementa Pinckney found that grace . Cynthia Hurd found that grace . Susie Jackson found that grace . Ethel Lance found that grace . DePayne Middleton Doctor found that grace . Tywanza Sanders found that grace . Daniel Simmons , found that grace . Sharonda Coleman Singleton found that grace . Myra Thompson found that grace . Through the example of their lives , they have now passed it on to us . May we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift , as long as our lives endure . May grace now lead them home . May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans Tonight marks the eighth year that I have come here to report on the State of the Union . And for this final one , I am going to try to make it a little shorter . I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa . I have been there . I will be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips . And I understand that because it is an election season , expectations for what we will achieve this year are low . But , Speaker , I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families . So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse . So , who knows , we might surprise the cynics again . But tonight , I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead . Do not worry , I have got plenty , from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients . And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done . Fixing a broken immigration system . Protecting our kids from gun violence . Equal pay for equal work . Paid leave . Raising the minimum wage . All these things still matter to hardworking families . They are still the right thing to do . And I will not let up until they get done . But for my final address to this chamber , I do not want to just talk about next year . I want to focus on the next five years , the next 10 years , and beyond . I want to focus on our future . We live in a time of extraordinary change change that is reshaping the way we live , the way we work , our planet , our place in the world . It is change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs , but also economic disruptions that strain working families . It promises education for girls in the most remote villages , but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away . It is change that can broaden opportunity , or widen inequality . And whether we like it or not , the pace of this change will only accelerate . America has been through big changes before wars and depression , the influx of new immigrants , workers fighting for a fair deal , movements to expand civil rights . Each time , there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control . And each time , we overcame those fears . We did not , in the words of Lincoln , adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past . Instead we thought anew , and acted anew . We made change work for us , always extending America s promise outward , to the next frontier , to more people . And because we did because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril we emerged stronger and better than before . What was true then can be true now . Our unique strengths as a nation our optimism and work ethic , our spirit of discovery , our diversity , our commitment to rule of law these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come . In fact , it is that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible . It is how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations . It is how we reformed our health care system , and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans , and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love . But such progress is not inevitable . It is the result of choices we make together . And we face such choices right now . Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear , turning inward as a nation , turning against each other as a people Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are , in what we stand for , in the incredible things that we can do together So let us talk about the future , and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next President is , or who controls the next Congress . First , how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy Second , how do we make technology work for us , and not against us especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change Third , how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman And finally , how can we make our politics reflect what is best in us , and not what is worst Let me start with the economy , and a basic fact The United States of America , right now , has the strongest , most durable economy in the world . We are in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history . More than 14 million new jobs , the strongest two years of job growth since the 90s , an unemployment rate cut in half . Our auto industry just had its best year ever . That is just part of a manufacturing surge that is created nearly 900 , 000 new jobs in the past six years . And we have done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three quarters . Anyone claiming that America s economy is in decline is peddling fiction . Now , what is true and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious is that the economy has been changing in profound ways , changes that started long before the Great Recession hit changes that have not let up . Today , technology does not just replace jobs on the assembly line , but any job where work can be automated . Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere , and they face tougher competition . As a result , workers have less leverage for a raise . Companies have less loyalty to their communities . And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top . All these trends have squeezed workers , even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing . It is made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty , harder for young people to start their careers , tougher for workers to retire when they want to . And although none of these trends are unique to America , they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot . For the past seven years , our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody . We have made progress . But we need to make more . And despite all the political arguments that we have had these past few years , there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree . We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good paying job . The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start , and together , we have increased early childhood education , lifted high school graduation rates to new highs , boosted graduates in fields like engineering . In the coming years , we should build on that progress , by providing Pre K for all and offering every student the hands on computer science and math classes that make them job ready on day one . We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids . And we have to make college affordable for every American . No hardworking student should be stuck in the red . We have already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower s income . And that is good . But now , we have actually got to cut the cost of college . Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that , and I am going to keep fighting to get that started this year . It is the right thing to do . But a great education is not all we need in this new economy . We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security . It is not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job , in the same place , with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber . For everyone else , especially folks in their 40s and 50s , saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher . Americans understand that at some point in their careers , in this new economy , they may have to retool and they may have to retrain . But they should not lose what they have already worked so hard to build in the process . That is why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever . We should not weaken them we should strengthen them . And for Americans short of retirement , basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today . That , by the way , is what the Affordable Care Act is all about . It is about filling the gaps in employer based care so that when you lose a job , or you go back to school , or you strike out and launch that new business , you will still have coverage . Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far . And in the process , health care inflation has slowed . And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law . Now , I am guessing we will not agree on health care anytime soon . A little applause right there . Just a guess . But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security . Say a hardworking American loses his job we should not just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that is ready to hire him . If that new job does not pay as much , there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills . And even if he is going from job to job , he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him . That is the way we make the new economy work better for everybody . I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty . America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance , a hand up . And I had welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support , like expanding tax cuts for low income workers who do not have children . But there are some areas where we just have to be honest it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years . And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations . And it is an honest disagreement , and the American people have a choice to make . I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy . I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed . There is red tape that needs to be cut . There you go Yes But after years now of record corporate profits , working families will not get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else s expense . Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered . Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on Wall Street did . Immigrants are not the principal reason wages have not gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long term returns . It is sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts . The point is , I believe that in this new economy , workers and start ups and small businesses need more of a voice , not less . The rules should work for them . And I am not alone in this . This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders . And I want to spread those best practices across America . That is part of a brighter future . In fact , it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative . And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges Sixty years ago , when the Russians beat us into space , we did not deny Sputnik was up there . We did not argue about the science , or shrink our research and development budget . We built a space program almost overnight . And 12 years later , we were walking on the moon . Now , that spirit of discovery is in our DNAmerica is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver . America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride . America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley , racing to shape a better world . That is who we are . And over the past seven years , we have nurtured that spirit . We have protected an open Internet , and taken bold new steps to get more students and low income Americans online . We have launched next generation manufacturing hubs , and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day . But we can do so much more . Last year , Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot , America can cure cancer . Last month , he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they have had in over a decade . So tonight , I am announcing a new national effort to get it done . And because he is gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years , I am putting Joe in charge of Mission Control . For the loved ones we have all lost , for the families that we can still save , let us make America the country that cures cancer once and for all . Medical research is critical . We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources . Look , if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change , have at it . You will be pretty lonely , because you will be debating our military , most of America s business leaders , the majority of the American people , almost the entire scientific community , and 200 nations around the world who agree it is a problem and intend to solve it . But even if even if the planet was not at stake , even if 2014 was not the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future Listen , seven years ago , we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history . Here are the results . In fields from Iowa to Texas , wind power is now cheaper than dirtier , conventional power . On rooftops from Arizona to New York , solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills , and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average . We are taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy something , by the way , that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support . And meanwhile , we have cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent , and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth . Gas under two bucks a gallon am not bad , either . Now we have got to accelerate the transition away from old , dirtier energy sources . Rather than subsidize the past , we should invest in the future especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels . We do them no favor when we do not show them where the trends are going . That is why I am going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources , so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet . And that way , we put money back into those communities , and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system . Now , none of this is going to happen overnight . And , yes , there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo . But the jobs we will create , the money we will save , the planet we will preserve that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve . And it is within our grasp . Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world . And that is why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation build everywhere there is a problem . I told you earlier all the talk of America s economic decline is political hot air . Well , so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker . Let me tell you something . The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth . Period . Period . It is not even close . It is not even close . It is not even close . We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined . Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world . No nation attacks us directly , or our allies , because they know that is the path to ruin . Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office , and when it comes to every important international issue , people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead they call us . I mean , it is useful to level the set here , because when we do not , we do not make good decisions . Now , as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing , I know this is a dangerous time . But that is not primarily because of some looming superpower out there , and certainly not because of diminished American strength . In today s world , we are threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states . The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation , rooted in conflicts that date back millennia . Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition . Even as their economy severely contracts , Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit . And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality . It is up to us , the United States of America , to help remake that system . And to do that well it means that we have got to set priorities . Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks . Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people , because in today s world , even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life , including their own , can do a lot of damage . They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country . Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies . We have to take them out . But as we focus on destroying ISIover the top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands . Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks , twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped . But they do not threaten our national existence . That is the story ISIL wants to tell . That is the kind of propaganda they use to recruit . We do not need to build them up to show that we are serious , and we sure do not need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world s largest religions . We just need to call them what they are killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out , hunted down , and destroyed . And that is exactly what we are doing . For more than a year , America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL s financing , disrupt their plots , stop the flow of terrorist fighters , and stamp out their vicious ideology . With nearly 10 , 000 air strikes , we are taking out their leadership , their oil , their training camps , their weapons . We are training , arming , and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria . If this Congress is serious about winning this war , and wants to send a message to our troops and the world , authorize the use of military force against ISITake a vote . Take a vote . But the American people should know that with or without congressional action , ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them . If you doubt America s commitment or mine to see that justice is done , just ask Osama bin Laden . Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen , who was taken out last year , or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks , who sits in a prison cell . When you come after Americans , we go after you . And it may take time , but we have long memories , and our reach has no limits . Our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda , but it cannot stop there . For even without ISIeven without al Qaeda , instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world in the Middle East , in Afghanistan , parts of Pakistan , in parts of Central America , in Africa , and Asia . Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks . Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict , or famine , feeding the next wave of refugees . The world will look to us to help solve these problems , and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians . That may work as a TV sound bite , but it does not pass muster on the world stage . We also cannot try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis , even if it is done with the best of intentions . That is not leadership that is a recipe for quagmire , spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us . It is the lesson of Vietnam it is the lesson of Iraq and we should have learned it by now . Fortunately , there is a smarter approach , a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power . It says America will always act , alone if necessary , to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern , we will mobilize the world to work with us , and make sure other countries pull their own weight . That is our approach to conflicts like Syria , where we are partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace . That is why we built a global coalition , with sanctions and principled diplomacy , to prevent a nuclear armed Iran . And as we speak , Iran has rolled back its nuclear program , shipped out its uranium stockpile , and the world has avoided another war . That is how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa . Our military , our doctors , our development workers they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic . Hundreds of thousands , maybe a couple million lives were saved . That is how we forged a Trans Pacific Partnership to open markets , and protect workers and the environment , and advance American leadership in Asia . It cuts 18 , 000 taxes on products made in America , which will then support more good jobs here in America . With TPChina does not set the rules in that region we do . You want to show our strength in this new century Approve this agreement . Give us the tools to enforce it . It is the right thing to do . Let me give you another example . Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy , and set us back in Latin America . That is why we restored diplomatic relations opened the door to travel and commerce , positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people . So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere , recognize that the Cold War is over lift the embargo . The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world except when we kill terrorists or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling . Leadership means a wise application of military power , and rallying the world behind causes that are right . It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security , not something separate , not charity . When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change , yes , that helps vulnerable countries , but it also protects our kids . When we help Ukraine defend its democracy , or Colombia resolve a decades long war , that strengthens the international order we depend on . When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick it is the right thing to do , and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores . Right now , we are on track to end the scourge of HIV AIDThat is within our grasp . And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something I will be pushing this Congress to fund this year . That is American strength . That is American leadership . And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example . That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo . It is expensive , it is unnecessary , and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies . There is a better way . And that is why we need to reject any politics any politics that targets people because of race or religion . Let me just say this . This is not a matter of political correctness . This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong . The world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity , and our openness , and the way we respect every faith . His Holiness , Pope Francis , told this body from the very spot that I am standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place . When politicians insult Muslims , whether abroad or our fellow citizens , when a mosque is vandalized , or a kid is called names , that does not make us safer . That is not telling it like it is . It is just wrong . It diminishes us in the eyes of the world . It makes it harder to achieve our goals . It betrays who we are as a country . We the People . Our Constitution begins with those three simple words , words we have come to recognize mean all the people , not just some words that insist we rise and fall together , and that is how we might perfect our Union . And that brings me to the fourth , and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight . The future we want all of us want opportunity and security for our families , a rising standard of living , a sustainable , peaceful planet for our kids all that is within our reach . But it will only happen if we work together . It will only happen if we can have rational , constructive debates . It will only happen if we fix our politics . A better politics does not mean we have to agree on everything . This is a big country different regions , different attitudes , different interests . That is one of our strengths , too . Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government , and expected us to argue , just as they did , fiercely , over the size and shape of government , over commerce and foreign relations , over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security . But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens . It does not work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice . It does not work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America . Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise , or when even basic facts are contested , or when we listen only to those who agree with us . Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention . And most of all , democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice does not matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest . Too many Americans feel that way right now . It is one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better . I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide , and I guarantee I will keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office . But , my fellow Americans , this cannot be my task or any President s alone . There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber , good people who would like to see more cooperation , would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington , but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected , by the noise coming out of your base . I know you have told me . It is the worst kept secret in Washington . And a lot of you are not enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor . But that means if we want a better politics and I am addressing the American people now if we want a better politics , it is not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President . We have to change the system to reflect our better selves . I think we have got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters , and not the other way around . Let a bipartisan group do it . We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics , so that a handful of families or hidden interests cannot bankroll our elections . And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cannot pass muster in the courts , we need to work together to find a real solution because it is a problem . And most of you do not like raising money . I know I have done it . We have got to make it easier to vote , not harder . We need to modernize it for the way we live now . This is America We want to make it easier for people to participate . And over the course of this year , I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that . But I cannot do these things on my own . Changes in our political process in not just who gets elected , but how they get elected that will only happen when the American people demand it . It depends on you . That is what is meant by a government of , by , and for the people . What I am suggesting is hard . It is a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible , and politics is hopeless , and the problem is all the folks who are elected do not care , and to believe that our voices and actions do not matter . But if we give up now , then we forsake a better future . Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war , or allow another economic disaster , or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought , even died , to secure . And then , as frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who do not look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background . We cannot afford to go down that path . It will not deliver the economy we want . It will not produce the security we want . But most of all , it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world . So , my fellow Americans , whatever you may believe , whether you prefer one party or no party , whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen . To vote . To speak out . To stand up for others , especially the weak , especially the vulnerable , knowing that each of us is only here because somebody , somewhere , stood up for us . We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day . It is not easy . Our brand of democracy is hard . But I can promise that a little over a year from now , when I no longer hold this office , I will be right there with you as a citizen , inspired by those voices of fairness and vision , of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far . Voices that help us see ourselves not , first and foremost , as black or white , or Asian or Latino , not as gay or straight , immigrant or native born , not as Democrat or Republican , but as Americans first , bound by a common creed . Voices King believed would have the final word voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love . And they are out there , those voices . They do not get a lot of attention they do not seek a lot of fanfare but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing . I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours . I see you , the American people . And in your daily acts of citizenship , I see our future unfolding . I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open , and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off . I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project , and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease . I see it in the American who served his time , and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance . The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat , treating everybody with respect , doing the brave , quiet work of keeping us safe . I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers , the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon , the community that lines up to cheer him on . It is the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is , and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he is been taught . I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth . That is the America I know . That is the country we love . Clear eyed . Big hearted . Undaunted by challenge . Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word . That is what makes me so hopeful about our future . I believe in change because I believe in you , the American people . And that is why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong . Thank you , God bless you . God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , everybody . As a candidate for President , I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world . After taking office , I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011 . As Commander in Chief , ensuring the success of this strategy has been one of my highest national security priorities . Last year , I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq . And to date , we have removed more than 100 , 000 troops . Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country s security . A few hours ago I spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki . I reaffirmed that the United States keeps its commitments . He spoke of the determination of the Iraqi people to forge their own future . We are in full agreement about how to move forward . So today , I can report that , as promised , the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year . After nearly nine years , America s war in Iraq will be over . Over the next two months , our troops in Iraq tens of thousands of them will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their heads held high , proud of their success , and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops . That is how America s military efforts in Iraq will end . But even as we mark this important milestone , we are also moving into a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Iraq . As of January 1st , and in keeping with our Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq , it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations , an equal partnership based on mutual interests and mutual respect . In today s conversation , Prime Minister Maliki and I agreed that a meeting of the Higher Coordinating Committee of the Strategic Framework Agreement will convene in the coming weeks . And I invited the Prime Minister to come to the White House in December , as we plan for all the important work that we have to do together . This will be a strong and enduring partnership . With our diplomats and civilian advisors in the lead , we will help Iraqis strengthen institutions that are just , representative and accountable . We will build new ties of trade and of commerce , culture and education , that unleash the potential of the Iraqi people . We will partner with an Iraq that contributes to regional security and peace , just as we insist that other nations respect Iraq s sovereignty . As I told Prime Minister Maliki , we will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces again , just as we offer training and assistance to countries around the world . After all , there will be some difficult days ahead for Iraq , and the United States will continue to have an interest in an Iraq that is stable , secure and self reliant . Just as Iraqis have persevered through war , I am confident that they can build a future worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization . Here at home , the coming months will be another season of homecomings . Across America , our servicemen and women will be reunited with their families . Today , I can say that our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays . This December will be a time to reflect on all that we have been though in this war . I will join the American people in paying tribute to the more than 1 million Americans who have served in Iraq . We will honor our many wounded warriors and the nearly 4 , 500 American patriots and their Iraqi and coalition partners who gave their lives to this effort . And finally , I would note that the end of war in Iraq reflects a larger transition . The tide of war is receding . The drawdown in Iraq allowed us to refocus our fight against al Qaeda and achieve major victories against its leadership including Osama bin Laden . Now , even as we remove our last troops from Iraq , we are beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan , where we have begun a transition to Afghan security and leadership . When I took office , roughly 180 , 000 troops were deployed in both these wars . And by the end of this year that number will be cut in half , and make no mistake It will continue to go down . Meanwhile , yesterday marked the definitive end of the Qaddafi regime in Libya . And there , too , our military played a critical role in shaping a situation on the ground in which the Libyan people can build their own future . Today , NATO is working to bring this successful mission to a close . So to sum up , the United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year . The transition in Afghanistan is moving forward , and our troops are finally coming home . As they do , fewer deployments and more time training will help keep our military the very best in the world . And as we welcome home our newest veterans , we will never stop working to give them and their families the care , the benefits and the opportunities that they have earned . This includes enlisting our veterans in the greatest challenge that we now face as a nation creating opportunity and jobs in this country . Because after a decade of war , the nation that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own an America that sees its economic strength restored just as we have restored our leadership around the globe . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Madam Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , the First Lady of the United States she is around here somewhere I have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great Chamber , but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here . I know that for many Americans watching right now , the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others , and rightly so . If you have not been personally affected by this recession , you probably know someone who has a friend , a neighbor , a member of your family . You do not need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis , because you live it every day . It is the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights . It is the job you thought you had retire from but now have lost , the business you built your dreams upon that is now hanging by a thread , the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope . The impact of this recession is real , and it is everywhere . But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation . The answers to our problems do not lie beyond our reach . They exist in our laboratories and our universities , in our fields and our factories , in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth . Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history , we still possess in ample measure . What is required now is for this country to pull together , confront boldly the challenges we face , and take responsibility for our future once more . Now , if we are honest with ourselves , we will admit that for too long , we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people . I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards , but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we will be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament . The fact is , our economy did not fall into decline overnight , nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank . We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy , yet we import more oil today than ever before . The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year , yet we keep delaying reform . Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for . And though all these challenges went unsolved , we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt , both as individuals and through our Government , than ever before . In other words , we have lived through an era where too often short term gains were prized over long term prosperity , where we failed to look beyond the next payment , the next quarter , or the next election . A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future . Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market . People bought homes they knew they could not afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway . And all the while , critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time , on some other day . Well , that day of reckoning has arrived , and the time to take charge of our future is here . Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy , but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity . Now is the time to jumpstart job creation , restart lending , and invest in areas like energy , health care , and education that will grow our economy , even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down . That is what my economic agenda is designed to do , and that is what I had like to talk to you about tonight . It is an agenda that begins with jobs . As soon as I took office , I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets , not because I believe in bigger Government I do not not because I am not mindful of the massive debt we have inherited I am . I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship . In fact , a failure to act would have worsened our long term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years . And that is why I pushed for quick action . And tonight I am grateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law . Over the next 2 years , this plan will save or create 3 . 5 million jobs . More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges , constructing wind turbines and solar panels , laying broadband and expanding mass transit . Because of this plan , there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids , health care professionals can continue caring for our sick . There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make . Because of this plan , 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st . Because of this plan , families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a 2 , 500 tax credit for all 4 years of college , and Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm . Now , I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work , and I understand that skepticism . Here in Washington , we have all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending . And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right . And that is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough , unprecedented oversight effort because nobody messes with Joe . I am I right They do not mess with him . I have told each of my Cabinet , as well as mayors and Governors across the country , that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend . I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud . And we have created a new web site called recovery . gov , so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent . So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track . But it is just the first step . Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly , there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system . I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight , because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family s well being . You should also know that the money you have deposited in banks across the country is safe , your insurance is secure , you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system . That is not the source of concern . The concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country , our recovery will be choked off before it even begins . You see , the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy . The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education , how stores stock their shelves , farms buy equipment , and businesses make payroll . But credit has stopped flowing the way it should . Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks . And with so much debt and so little confidence , these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households , to businesses , or even to each other . And when there is no lending , families cannot afford to buy homes or cars , so businesses are forced to make layoffs . Our economy suffers even more , and credit dries up even further . That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle , to restore confidence , and restart lending . And we will do so in several ways . First , we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans , college loans , and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running . Second , we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages . It is a plan that will not help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford , but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about . In fact , the average family who refinances today can save nearly 2 , 000 per year on their mortgage . Third , we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times . And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems , we will hold accountable those responsible , force the necessary adjustments , provide the support to clean up their balance sheets , and assure the continuity of a strong , viable institution that can serve our people and our economy . Now , I understand that on any given day , Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions . But such an approach will not solve the problem , and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all . And I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive , and this time , they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer . This time , CEOs will not be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet . Those days are over . Still , this plan will require significant resources from the Federal Government and , yes , probably more than we have already set aside . But while the cost of action will be great , I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater , for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years , but perhaps a decade . That would be worse for our deficit , worse for business , worse for you , and worse for the next generation . And I refuse to let that happen . Now , I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks , Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed . So were the American taxpayers so was So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now , especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions . I promise you , I get it . But I also know that in a time of crisis , we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment . My job our job is to solve the problem . Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility . I will not send I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive , but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that cannot pay its workers or the family that has saved and still cannot get a mortgage . That is what this is about . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . Because when credit is available again , that young family can finally buy a new home . And then some company will hire workers to build it . And then those workers will have money to spend . And if they can get a loan too , maybe they will finally buy that car or open their own business . Investors will return to the market , and American families will see their retirement secured once more . Slowly but surely , confidence will return and our economy will recover . So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary , because we cannot consign our Nation to an open ended recession . And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system . It is time to put in place tough , new , commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation , and punishes shortcuts and abuse . The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we are taking to revive our economy in the short term . But the only way to fully restore America s economic strength is to make the long term investments that will lead to new jobs , new industries , and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world . The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care , the schools that are not preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit . That is our responsibility . In the next few days , I will submit a budget to Congress . So often , we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs . I see this document differently . I see it as a vision for America , as a blueprint for our future . My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue . It reflects the stark reality of what we have inherited , a trillion dollar deficit , a financial crisis , and a costly recession . Given these realities , everyone in this Chamber , Democrats and Republicans , will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars . And that includes me . But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long term challenges . I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves , that says Government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity . For history tells a different story . History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation , this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas . In the midst of Civil War , we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry . From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age . In the wake of war and depression , the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history . And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways , an American on the Moon , and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world . In each case , Government did not supplant private enterprise it catalyzed private enterprise . It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive . We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal . Now we must be that nation again , and that is why , even as it cuts back on programs we do not need , the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future energy , health care , and education . It begins with energy . We know the country that harnesses the power of clean , renewable energy will lead the 21st century . And yet , it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient . We invented solar technology , but we have fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it . New plug in hybrids roll off our assembly lines , but they will run on batteries made in Korea . Well , I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders , and I know you do not either . It is time for America to lead again . Thanks to our recovery plan , we will double this Nation s supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years . We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history , an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology . We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country . And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills . But to truly transform our economy , to protect our security , and save our planet from the ravages of climate change , we need to ultimately make clean , renewable energy the profitable kind of energy . So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America . That is what we need . And to support that innovation , we will invest 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power , advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . Speaking of our auto industry , everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink . We should not , and will not , protect them from their own bad practices . But we are committed to the goal of a retooled , reimagined auto industry that can compete and win . Millions of jobs depend on it scores of communities depend on it . And I believe the Nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it . Now , none of this will come without cost , nor will it be easy . But this is America . We do not do what is easy . We do what is necessary to move this country forward . And for that same reason , we must also address the crushing cost of health care . This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds . By the end of the year , it could cause 1 . 5 million Americans to lose their homes . In the last 8 years , premiums have grown four times faster than wages . And in each of these years , 1 million more Americans have lost their health insurance . It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas . And it is one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget . Given these facts , we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold . We cannot afford to do it . It is time . Already , we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than we have done in the last decade . When it was days old , this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time . Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records , a new technology that will reduce errors , bring down costs , ensure privacy , and save lives . It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American , including me , by seeking a cure for cancer in our time . And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care , because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control . This budget builds on these reforms . It includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform , a down payment on the principle that we must have quality , affordable health care for every American . It is a commitment that is paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue . And it is a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come . Now , there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform , and that is why I am bringing together businesses and workers , doctors and health care providers , Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week . I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process . Once again , it will be hard . But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform , the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough . So let there be no doubt Health care reform cannot wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America . In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge , a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity , it is a prerequisite . Right now , three quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma . And yet , just over half of our citizens have that level of education . We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation , and half of the students who begin college never finish . This is a prescription for economic decline , because we know the countries that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow . That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education , from the day they are born to the day they begin a career . That is a promise we have to make to the children of America . Already , we have made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan . We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality , because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life . We have made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students 7 million . And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children s progress . But we know that our schools do not just need more resources , they need more reform . And that is why this budget creates new teachers new incentives for teacher performance , pathways for advancement , and rewards for success . We will invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps , and we will expand our commitment to charter schools . It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work . But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it . So tonight I ask every American to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training . This can be community college or a 4 year school , vocational training or an apprenticeship . But whatever the training may be , every American will need to get more than a high school diploma . And dropping out of high school is no longer an option . It is not just quitting on yourself , it is quitting on your country , and this country needs and values the talents of every American . That is why we will support we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans to complete college and meet a new goal . By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . That is a goal we can meet . That is a goal we can meet . Now , I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever , which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country , we will make sure that you can afford a higher education . And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations , I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch , as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country , Senator Edward Kennedy . These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children , but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them . In the end , there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent , for a mother or father who will attend those parent teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the Tput away the video games , read to their child . I speak to you not just as a President , but as a father , when I say that responsibility for our children s education must begin at home . That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue that is an American issue . There is , of course , another responsibility we have to our children . And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay . That is critical . I agree , absolutely . See , I know we can get some consensus in here . With the deficit we inherited , the cost of the crisis we face , and the long term challenges we must meet , it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers , we do what it takes to bring this deficit down . That is critical . Now , I am proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks , and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities . And yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office . My administration has also begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs . As you can imagine , this is a process that will take some time . But we have already identified 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . In this budget , we will end education programs that do not work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that do not need them . We will eliminate the no bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we are not paying for cold war era weapons systems we do not use . We will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that does not make our seniors any healthier . We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax Code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas . In order to save our children from a future of debt , we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Now , let me be clear let me be absolutely clear , because I know you will end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people If your family earns less than 250 , 000 a year , a quarter million dollars a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . I repeat Not one single dime . In fact not a dime in fact , the recovery plan provides a tax cut that is right , a tax cut for 95 percent of working families . And by the way , these checks are on the way . Now , to preserve our long term fiscal health , we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security . Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come . And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security , while creating tax free universal savings accounts for all Americans . Finally , because we are also suffering from a deficit of trust , I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget . That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules . And for the first time , that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . For 7 years , we have been a nation at war . No longer will we hide its price . Along with our outstanding national security team , I am now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars , and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war . And with our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat extremism , because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world . We will not allow it . As we meet here tonight , our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy . To each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence , Americans are united in sending one message We honor your service we are inspired by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding support . To relieve the strain on our forces , my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines . And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve , we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned . To overcome extremism , we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend , because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America . And that is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists . Because living our values does not make us weaker , it makes us safer and it makes us stronger . And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture . We can make that commitment here tonight . In words and deeds , we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun . For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone , but the world cannot meet them without America . We cannot shun the negotiating table , nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm . We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand . To seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors , we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort . To meet the challenges of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear proliferation , from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty we will strengthen old alliances , forge new ones , and use all elements of our national power . And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope , we are working with the nations of the G 20 to restore confidence in our financial system , avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism , and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe . For the world depends on us having a strong economy , just as our economy depends on the strength of the world s . As we stand at this crossroads of history , the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us , watching to see what we do with this moment , waiting for us to lead . Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times . It is a tremendous burden , but also a great privilege , one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans . For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill . I know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth , to become cynical and doubtful , consumed with the petty and the trivial . But in my life , I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places , that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity , but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are anything but ordinary . I think of Leonard Abess , a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company , took a 60 million bonus , and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him , plus another 72 who used to work for him . He did not tell anyone , but when the local newspaper found out , he simply said , I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old . It did not feel right getting the money myself . I think about Greensburg , Kansas , a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado , but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community , how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay . The tragedy was terrible , said one of the men who helped them rebuild . But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity . I think about Ty Sheoma Bethea , the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon , South Carolina , a place where the ceilings leak , the paint peels off the walls , and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom . She had been told that her school is hopeless , but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber . She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp . The letter asks us for help and says We are just students trying to become lawyers , doctors , Congressmen like yourself , and one day President , so we can make a change to not just the State of South Carolina but also the world . We are not quitters . That is what she said We are not quitters . These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here . They tell us that even in the most trying times , amid the most difficult circumstances , there is a generosity , a resilience , a decency , and a determination that perseveres , a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity . Their resolve must be our inspiration . Their concerns must be our cause . And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us . I know look , I know that we have not agreed on every issue thus far . There are surely times in the future where we will part ways . But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed . I know that . That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done . That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground . And if we do , if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths of this crisis , if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity , if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit , then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed , in the words that are carved into this very Chamber , something worthy to be remembered . Thank you . God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>Thank you , everybody . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you , everybody . Please have a seat . Thank you . I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for their extraordinary leadership . I want to recognize Buzz Aldrin as well , who is in the house . Four decades ago , Buzz became a legend . But in the four decades since he is also been one of America s leading visionaries and authorities on human space flight . Few people present company excluded can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill and Charlie when it comes to space exploration . I have to say that few people are as singularly unimpressed by Air Force One as those three . Sure , it is comfortable , but it cannot even reach low Earth orbit . And that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just saw on the launch pad , which will be tested for the very first time in the coming weeks . A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make . We have got Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from Texas visiting us , a big supporter of the space program . My director , Office of Science and Technology Policy in other words my chief science advisor John Holdren is here . And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman Suzanne Kosmas , because every time I meet with her , including the flight down here , she reminds me of how important our NASA programs are and how important this facility is . And she is fighting for every single one of you and for her district and for the jobs in her district . And you should know that you have got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas . Please give her a big round of applause . I also want to thank everybody for participating in today s conference . And gathered here are scientists , engineers , business leaders , public servants , and a few more astronauts as well . Last but not least , I want to thank the men and women of NASA for welcoming me to the Kennedy Space Center , and for your contributions not only to America , but to the world . Here at the Kennedy Space Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of those contributions . It was from here that NASA launched the missions of Mercury and Gemini and Apollo . It was from here that Space Shuttle Discovery , piloted by Charlie Bolden , carried the Hubble Telescope into orbit , allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy . And I should point out , by the way , that in my private office just off the Oval , I have got the picture of Jupiter from the Hubble . So thank you , Charlie , for helping to decorate my office . It was from here that men and women , propelled by sheer nerve and talent , set about pushing the boundaries of humanity s reach . That is the story of NASAnd it is a story that started a little more than half a century ago , far from the Space Coast , in a remote and desolate region of what is now called Kazakhstan . Because it was from there that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik , the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth , which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and a battery strapped to the top of a missile . But the world was stunned . Americans were dumbfounded . The Soviets , it was perceived , had taken the lead in a race for which we were not yet fully prepared . But we caught up very quick . President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and to invest in science and math education , from grade school to graduate school . In 1961 , President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth within the decade . And as a nation , we set about meeting that goal , reaping rewards that have in the decades since touched every facet of our lives . NASA was at the forefront . Many gave their careers to the effort . And some have given far more . In the years that have followed , the space race inspired a generation of scientists and innovators , including , I am sure , many of you . It is contributed to immeasurable technological advances that have improved our health and well being , from satellite navigation to water purification , from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging . Although , I have to say , during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said , you know , it is more than just Tang and I had to point out I actually really like Tang . I thought that was very cool . And leading the world to space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here on Earth , while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of its people . And on a personal note , I have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program . 1961 was the year of my birth the year that Kennedy made his announcement . And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather s shoulders , waving a flag as astronauts arrived in Hawaii . For me , the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an American reaching for new heights , stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible . And so , as President , I believe that space exploration is not a luxury , it is not an afterthought in America s quest for a brighter future it is an essential part of that quest . So today , I had like to talk about the next chapter in this story . The challenges facing our space program are different , and our imperatives for this program are different , than in decades past . We are no longer racing against an adversary . We are no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like reaching the Moon . In fact , what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration . But while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years , what we do or fail to do in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth . So let me start by being extremely clear I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future . Because broadening our capabilities in space will continue to serve our society in ways that we can scarcely imagine . Because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation sparking passions and launching careers . And because , ultimately , if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery , we are ceding our future and we are ceding that essential element of the American character . I know there have been a number of questions raised about my administration s plan for space exploration , especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on NASA as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community . And these questions come at a time of transition , as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service . And understandably , this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about their own futures but about the future of the space program to which they have devoted their lives . But I also know that underlying these concerns is a deeper worry , one that precedes not only this plan but this administration . It stems from the sense that people in Washington driven sometimes less by vision than by politics have for years neglected NASA s mission and undermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it . We have seen that in the NASA budget , which has risen and fallen with the political winds . But we can also see it in other ways in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear , achievable objectives to provide the resources to meet those objectives and to justify not just these plans but the larger purpose of space exploration in the 21st century . All that has to change . And with the strategy I am outlining today , it will . We start by increasing NASA s budget by 6 billion over the next five years , even I want people to understand the context of this . This is happening even as we have instituted a freeze on discretionary spending and sought to make cuts elsewhere in the budget . So NASfrom the start , several months ago when I issued my budget , was one of the areas where we did not just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by 6 billion . By doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system , including a probe of the Sun s atmosphere new scouting missions to Mars and other destinations and an advanced telescope to follow Hubble , allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before . We will increase Earth based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world science that will garner tangible benefits , helping us to protect our environment for future generations . And we will extend the life of the International Space Station likely by more than five years , while actually using it for its intended purpose conducting advanced research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on Earth , as well as testing and improving upon our capabilities in space . This includes technologies like more efficient life support systems that will help reduce the cost of future missions . And in order to reach the space station , we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable . Now , I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way . I disagree . The truth is , NASA has always relied on private industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space , from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago , to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead . By buying the services of space transportation rather than the vehicles themselves we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met . But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations as companies from young startups to established leaders compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere . In addition , as part of this effort , we will build on the good work already done on the Orion crew capsule . I have directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a rescue vehicle using this technology , so we are not forced to rely on foreign providers if it becomes necessary to quickly bring our people home from the International Space Station . And this Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions . In fact , Orion will be readied for flight right here in this room . Next , we will invest more than 3 billion to conduct research on an advanced heavy lift rocket a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsules , propulsion systems , and large quantities of supplies needed to reach deep space . In developing this new vehicle , we will not only look at revising or modifying older models we want to look at new designs , new materials , new technologies that will transform not just where we can go but what we can do when we get there . And we will finalize a rocket design no later than 2015 and then begin to build it . And I want everybody to understand That is at least two years earlier than previously planned and that is conservative , given that the previous program was behind schedule and over budget . At the same time , after decades of neglect , we will increase investment right away in other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and more often , to travel farther and faster for less cost , and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely . That means tackling major scientific and technological challenges . How do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions How do we harness resources on distant worlds How do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these far reaching journeys These are questions that we can answer and will answer . And these are the questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth . So the point is what we are looking for is not just to continue on the same path we want to leap into the future we want major breakthroughs a transformative agenda for NAS Now , yes , pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy . In part , this is because the old strategy including the Constellation program was not fulfilling its promise in many ways . That is not just my assessment that is also the assessment of a panel of respected non partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely . Now , despite this , some have had harsh words for the decisions we have made , including some individuals who I have got enormous respect and admiration for . But what I hope is , is that everybody will take a look at what we are planning , consider the details of what we have laid out , and see the merits as I have described them . The bottom line is nobody is more committed to manned space flight , to human exploration of space than I am . But we have got to do it in a smart way , and we cannot just keep on doing the same old things that we have been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where we want to go . Some have said , for instance , that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to produce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit , instead of relying on companies and other countries . But we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan , in ways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs , which are both essential for the long term sustainability of space flight . In fact , through our plan , we will be sending many more astronauts to space over the next decade . There are also those who criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that will hinder space exploration below low Earth orbit . But it is precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities even as we build on the important work already completed , through projects like Orion , for future missions . And unlike the previous program , we are setting a course with specific and achievable milestones . Early in the next decade , a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit . And by 2025 , we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space . So we will start we will start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history . By the mid 2030s , I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth . And a landing on Mars will follow . And I expect to be around to see it . But I want to repeat I want to repeat this Critical to deep space exploration will be the development of breakthrough propulsion systems and other advanced technologies . So I am challenging NASA to break through these barriers . And we will give you the resources to break through these barriers . And I know you will , with ingenuity and intensity , because that is what you have always done . Now , I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the Moon first , as previously planned . But I just have to say pretty bluntly here We have been there before . Buzz has been there . There is a lot more of space to explore , and a lot more to learn when we do . So I believe it is more important to ramp up our capabilities to reach and operate at a series of increasingly demanding targets , while advancing our technological capabilities with each step forward . And that is what this strategy does . And that is how we will ensure that our leadership in space is even stronger in this new century than it was in the last . Finally , I want to say a few words about jobs . Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time I was here , I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who are already going through a tough time here in this region were helped . And despite some reports to the contrary , my plan will add more than 2 , 500 jobs along the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previous administration . So I want to make that point . We are going to modernize the Kennedy Space Center , creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities . And there is potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and across America compete to be part of a new space transportation industry . And some of those industry leaders are here today . This holds the promise of generating more than 10 , 000 jobs nationwide over the next few years . And many of these jobs will be created right here in Florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition . Now , it is true there are Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program winds down . This is based on a decision that was made six years ago , not six months ago , but that does not make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality . So I am proposing in part because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne , as well as Charlie I am proposing a 40 million initiative led by a high level team from the White House , NASand other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation . And I expect this plan to reach my desk by August 15th . It is an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond . So this is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASWe will partner with industry . We will invest in cutting edge research and technology . We will set far reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones . And step by step , we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do . Fifty years after the creation of NASour goal is no longer just a destination to reach . Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time , ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite . And in fulfilling this task , we will not only extend humanity s reach in space we will strengthen America s leadership here on Earth . Now , I will close by saying this . I know that some Americans have asked a question that is particularly apt on Tax Day Why spend money on NASA at all Why spend money solving problems in space when we do not lack for problems to solve here on the ground And obviously our country is still reeling from the worst economic turmoil we have known in generations . We have massive structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years . But you and I know this is a false choice . We have to fix our economy . We need to close our deficits . But for pennies on the dollar , the space program has fueled jobs and entire industries . For pennies on the dollar , the space program has improved our lives , advanced our society , strengthened our economy , and inspired generations of Americans . And I have no doubt that NASA can continue to fulfill this role . But that is why but I want to say clearly to those of you who work for NASbut to the entire community that has been so supportive of the space program in this area That is exactly why it is so essential that we pursue a new course and that we revitalize NASA and its mission not just with dollars , but with clear aims and a larger purpose . Now , little more than 40 years ago , astronauts descended the nine rung ladder of the lunar module called Eagle , and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earth s only Moon . This was the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit of an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of our knowledge , of our technological prowess , of our very capacity as human beings to solve problems . It was not just the greatest achievement in NASA s history it was one of the greatest achievements in human history . And the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something . I choose to believe it was only the beginning . So thank you . God bless you . And may God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans , tonight , I had like to talk with you about immigration . For more than 200 years , our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations . It is kept us youthful , dynamic , and entrepreneurial . It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities people not trapped by our past , but able to remake ourselves as we choose . But today , our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it . Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules . Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less . All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America . And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows , or risk their families being torn apart . It is been this way for decades . And for decades , we have not done much about it . When I took office , I committed to fixing this broken immigration system . And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders . Today , we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history . And over the past six years , illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half . Although this summer , there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border , the number of such children is now actually lower than it is been in nearly two years . Overall , the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s . Those are the facts . Meanwhile , I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix , and last year , 68 Democrats , Republicans , and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate . It was not perfect . It was a compromise . But it reflected common sense . It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine , started paying their taxes , and went to the back of the line . And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits . Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes or no vote , it would have passed with support from both parties , and today it would be the law . But for a year and a half now , Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote . Now , I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law . But until that happens , there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just . Tonight , I am announcing those actions . First , we will build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings , and speed the return of those who do cross over . Second , I will make it easier and faster for high skilled immigrants , graduates , and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy , as so many business leaders have proposed . Third , we will take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country . I want to say more about this third issue , because it generates the most passion and controversy . Even as we are a nation of immigrants , we are also a nation of laws . Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws , and I believe that they must be held accountable especially those who may be dangerous . That is why , over the past six years , deportations of criminals are up 80 percent . And that is why we are going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security . Felons , not families . Criminals , not children . Gang members , not a mom who is working hard to provide for her kids . We will prioritize , just like law enforcement does every day . But even as we focus on deporting criminals , the fact is , millions of immigrants in every state , of every race and nationality still live here illegally . And let us be honest tracking down , rounding up , and deporting millions of people is not realistic . Anyone who suggests otherwise is not being straight with you . It is also not who we are as Americans . After all , most of these immigrants have been here a long time . They work hard , often in tough , low paying jobs . They support their families . They worship at our churches . Many of their kids are American born or spent most of their lives here , and their hopes , dreams , and patriotism are just like ours . As my predecessor , President Bush , once put it They are a part of American life . Now here s the thing We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules . We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded . So we are going to offer the following deal If you have been in America for more than five years if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents if you register , pass a criminal background check , and you are willing to pay your fair share of taxes you will be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation . You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . That is what this deal is . Now , let us be clear about what it is not . This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently . It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future . It does not grant citizenship , or the right to stay here permanently , or offer the same benefits that citizens receive only Congress can do that . All we are saying is we are not going to deport you . I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty . Well , it is not . Amnesty is the immigration system we have today millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time . That is the real amnesty leaving this broken system the way it is . Mass amnesty would be unfair . Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character . What I am describing is accountability a common sense , middle ground approach If you meet the criteria , you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . If you are a criminal , you will be deported . If you plan to enter the illegally , your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up . The actions I am taking are not only lawful , they are the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century . And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better , or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed , I have one answer Pass a bill . I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution . And the day I sign that bill into law , the actions I take will no longer be necessary . Meanwhile , do not let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue . That is not how our democracy works , and Congress certainly should not shut down our government again just because we disagree on this . Americans are tired of gridlock . What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose a higher purpose . Most Americans support the types of reforms I have talked about tonight . But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home . Millions of us , myself included , go back generations in this country , with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens . So we do not like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship . I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are , or take our jobs , or stick it to middle class families at a time when they already feel like they have gotten the raw deal for over a decade . I hear these concerns . But that is not what these steps would do . Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society . And I believe it is important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other s character . Because for all the back and forth of Washington , we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger . It is about who we are as a country , and who we want to be for future generations . Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends , take responsibility , and give their kids a better future Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents arms Or are we a nation that values families , and works together to keep them together Are we a nation that educates the world s best and brightest in our universities , only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here , create businesses here , create industries right here in America That is what this debate is all about . We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration . We need reasoned , thoughtful , compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes , not our fears . I know the politics of this issue are tough . But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it . Over the past few years , I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government , and at risk any moment of losing it all , just to build a better life for their kids . I have seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they did not have the right papers . I have seen the courage of students who , except for the circumstances of their birth , are as American as Malia or Sasha students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love . These people our neighbors , our classmates , our friends they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life . They came to work , and study , and serve in our military , and above all , contribute to America s success . Tomorrow , I will travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students , including a young woman named Astrid Silva . Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old . Her only possessions were a cross , her doll , and the frilly dress she had on . When she started school , she did not speak any English . She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBand she became a good student . Her father worked in landscaping . Her mom cleaned other people s homes . They would not let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school , not because they did not love her , but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant so she applied behind their back and got in . Still , she mostly lived in the shadows until her grandmother , who visited every year from Mexico , passed away , and she could not travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported . It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her , and today , Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree . Are we a nation that kicks out a striving , hopeful immigrant like Astrid , or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger , for we know the heart of a stranger we were strangers once , too . My fellow Americans , we are and always will be a nation of immigrants . We were strangers once , too . And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic , or the Pacific , or the Rio Grande , we are here only because this country welcomed them in , and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like , or what our last names are , or how we worship . What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal , and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will . That is the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us . That is the tradition we must uphold . That is the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless this country we love .<speech_sep>Hello , Ohio It is good to be here in the Buckeye State . Congratulations on winning the Big Ten Championship . I am filling out my brackets now . And it is even better to be out of Washington for a little while . Yes , that kid Turner looks pretty good . You guys are doing all right . It is wonderful to be here I love you back . I do . Couple of people I just want to make sure I give special mention to . First of all , you already saw him , Governor Ted Strickland in the house . Ted is fighting every day to bring jobs and economic development to Ohio . So is your terrific United States Senator Sherrod Brown . Love Sherrod Brown . Your own congressman , who is tireless on behalf of working people , Dennis Kucinich . Did you hear that , Dennis Go ahead , say that again . A couple members of Congress are here Representative Betty Sutton . Representative Marcia Fudge . Representative Tim Ryan . Representative Charlie Wilson . I want to thank Mayor Tom Perciak here in Strongsville . Please , Mayor , you are on . That is a good bunch of folks we got here in Ohio , working hard . Which is why I am glad to be back and let us face it , it is nice to be out of Washington once in a while . I want to thank Connie I want to thank Connie , who introduced me . I want to thank her and her family for being here on behalf of her sister , Natoma . I do not know if everybody understood that Natoma is in the hospital right now , so Connie was filling in . It is not easy to share such a personal story , when your sister who you love so much is sick . And so I appreciate Connie being willing to do so here today , and and I want everybody to understand that Connie and her sister are the reason that I am here today . See , Connie felt it was important that her sister s story be told . But I want to just repeat what happened here . Last month , I got a letter from Connie s sister , Natoma . She is self employed , she is trying to make ends meet , and for years she is done the responsible thing , just like most of you have . She bought insurance she did not have a big employer who provided her insurance , so she bought her health insurance through the individual market . And it was important for her to have insurance because 16 years ago , she was diagnosed with a treatable form of cancer . And even though she had been cancer free for more than a decade , the insurance companies kept on jacking up her rates , year after year . So she increased her out of pocket expenses . She raised her deductible . She did everything she could to maintain her health insurance that would be there just in case she got sick , because she figured , I did not want to be she did not want to be in a position where , if she did get sick , somebody else would have to pick up the tab that she had have to go to the emergency room that the cost would be shifted onto folks through their higher insurance premiums or hospitals charging higher rates . So she tried to do the right thing . And she upped her deductible last year to the minimum , the highest possible deductible . But despite that , Natoma s insurance company raised her premiums by more than 25 percent . And over the past year , she paid more than 6 , 000 in monthly premiums . She paid more than 4 , 000 in out of pocket medical costs , for co pays and medical care and prescriptions . So all together , this woman paid 10 , 000 one year . But because she never hit her deductible , her insurance company only spent 900 on her care . So the insurance company is making getting 10 , 000 paying out 900 . Now , what comes in the mail at the end of last year It is a letter telling Natoma that her premiums would go up again by more than 40 percent . So here s what happens . She just could not afford it . She did not have the money . She realized that if she paid those health insurance premiums that had been jacked up by 40 percent , she could not make her mortgage . And despite her desire to keep her coverage , despite her fears that she would get sick and lose the home that her parents built she finally surrendered , she finally gave up her health insurance . She stopped paying it she could not make ends meet . So January was her last month of being insured . Like so many responsible Americans folks who work hard every day , who try to do the right thing she was forced to hang her fortunes on chance . To take a chance , that is all she could do . She hoped against hope that she would stay healthy . She feared terribly that she might not stay healthy . That was the letter that I read to the insurance companies , including the person responsible for raising her rates . Now , I understand Natoma was pretty surprised when she found out that I had read it to these CEOs . But I thought it was important for them to understand the human dimensions of this problem . Her rates have been hiked more than 40 percent . And this was less than two weeks ago . Unfortunately , Natoma s worst fears were realized . And just last week , she was working on a nearby farm , walking outside apparently , chasing after a cow when she collapsed . And she was rushed to the hospital . She was very sick . She needed two blood transfusions . Doctors performed a battery of tests . And on Saturday , Natoma was diagnosed with leukemia . Now , the reason Natoma is not here today is that she is lying on a hospital bed , suddenly faced with this emergency suddenly faced with the fight of her life . She expects to face more than a month of aggressive chemotherapy . She is racked with worry not only about her illness but about the costs of the tests and the treatment that she is surely going to need to beat it . So you want to know why I am here , Ohio I am here because of Natoma . I am here because of the countless others who have been forced to face the most terrifying challenges in their lives with the added burden of medical bills they cannot pay . I do not think that is right . Neither do you . That is why we need health insurance right now . Health insurance reform right now . I am here because of my own mother s story . She died of cancer , and in the last six months of her life , she was on the phone in her hospital room arguing with insurance companies instead of focusing on getting well and spending time with her family . I am here because of the millions who are denied coverage because of preexisting conditions or dropped from coverage when they get sick . I am here because of the small businesses who are forced to choose between health care and hiring . I am here because of the seniors unable to afford the prescriptions that they need . I am here because of the folks seeing their premiums go up 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 percent in a year . Ohio , I am here because that is not the America I believe in and that is not the America that you believe in . So when you hear people say start over I want you to think about Natoma . When you hear people saying that this is not the right time , you think about what she is going through . When you hear people talk about , well , what does this mean for the Democrats What does this mean for the Republicans I do not know how the polls are doing . When you hear people more worried about the politics of it than what is right and what is wrong , I want you to think about Natoma and the millions of people all across this country who are looking for some help , and looking for some relief . That is why we need health insurance reform right now . Part of what makes this issue difficult is most of us do have health insurance , we still do . And so and so we kind of feel like , well , I do not know , it is kind of working for me I am not worrying too much . But what we have to understand is that what is happened to Natoma , there but for the grace of God go any one of us . Anybody here , if you lost your job right now and after the COBRA ran out It looks like we have got somebody who might have fainted down there , so if we have got a medic . No , no , no . Hold on . I am talking about there is somebody who might have fainted right down here , so if we can get a medic just back here . They are probably okay . Just give her or him some space . So let us just think about think about if you lost your job right now . How many people here might have had a preexisting condition that would mean it had be very hard to get health insurance on the individual market Think about if you wanted to change jobs . Think about if you wanted to start your own business but you suddenly had to give up your health insurance on your job . Think about what happens if a child of yours , heaven forbid , got diagnosed with something that made it hard for them to insure . For so many people , it may not be a problem right now but it is going to be a problem later , at any point . And even if you have got good health insurance , what is happening to your premiums What is happening to your co payments What is happening to your deductible They are all going up . That is money straight out of your pocket . So the bottom line is this The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable . We cannot have we cannot have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people . And we know what will happen if we fail to act . We know that our government will be plunged deeper into debt . We know that millions more people will lose their coverage . We know that rising costs will saddle millions more families with unaffordable expenses . And a lot of small businesses are just going to drop their coverage altogether . That is already what is been happening . A study came out just yesterday this is a nonpartisan study it is found that without reform , premiums could more than double for individuals and families over the next decade . Family policies could go to an average of 25 , 000 or more . Can you afford that You think your employer can afford that Your employer cannot sustain that . So what is going to happen is , they are basically more and more of them are just going to say , you know what You are on your own on this . We have debated this issue now for more than a year . Every proposal has been put on the table . Every argument has been made . I know a lot of people view this as a partisan issue , but , look , the fact is both parties have a lot of areas where we agree it is just politics are getting in the way of actually getting it done . Somebody asked what is our plan . Let me describe exactly what we are doing , because we have ended up with a proposal that incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans , even though Republicans do not give us any credit . That is all right . You know , if you think about the debate around health care reform , there were some who wanted to scrap the system of private insurance and replace it with government run care . And , look , that works in a number of places , but I did not see that being practical to help right away for people who really need it . And on the other end of the spectrum , and this is what a lot of the Republicans are saying right now , there are those who simply believe that the answer is to unleash the insurance industry , to deregulate them further , provide them less oversight and fewer rules . This is called the fox guarding the henhouse approach to health insurance reform . So what it would do is it would give insurance companies more leeway to raise premiums , more leeway to deny care . It would segment the market further . It would be good if you were rich and healthy . You had save money . But if you are an ordinary person , if you get older , if you get a little sicker , you had be paying more . Now , I do not believe we should give the government or insurance companies more control over health care in America . I believe it is time to give you , the American people , more control over your own health insurance . And that is what our proposal does . Our proposal builds on the current system where most Americans get their health insurance from their employer . So if you like your plan , you can keep your plan . If you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor . I do not want to interfere with people s relationships between them and their doctors . Essentially , here s what my proposal would change three things about the current health care system , but three important things . Number one , it would end the worst practices of the insurance companies . All right This is like a patient s bill of rights on steroids . Within the first year of signing health care reform , thousands of uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time in their lives or the first time since they got sick . This year , insurance companies will be banned forever from denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions . So parents can have a little bit of security . This year , under this legislation , insurance companies will be banned from dropping your coverage when you get sick . Those practices would end . With this reform package , all new insurance plans would be required to offer free preventive care to their customers starting this year so free check ups to catch preventable diseases on the front end . That is a smart thing to do . Starting this year , if you buy a new plan , there will not be lifetime or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care you receive from your insurance companies , so you will not be surprised by the fine print that says suddenly they have stopped paying and you now suddenly are 50 , 000 or 100 , 000 or 200 , 000 out of pocket . That will not that will not happen if this becomes law this year . I see I see some young people in the audience . If you are an uninsured young adult , you will be able to stay on your parents policy until you are 26 years old under this law . So number one number one is insurance reform . The second thing that this plan would change about the current system is this For the first time , uninsured individuals , small businesses , they had have the same kind of choice of private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves . Understand if this reform becomes law , members of Congress , they will be getting their insurance from the same place that the uninsured get theirs , because if it is good enough for the American people , it is good enough for the people who send us to Washington . So basically what would happen is , we had set up a pool of people millions of people across the country would all buy into these pools that give them more negotiating power . If you work for a big company , you have got a better insurance deal because you have got more bargaining power as a whole . We want you to have all the bargaining power that the federal employees have , that big companies have , so you will be able to buy in or a small business will be able to buy into this pool . And that will lower rates , it is estimated , by up to 14 to 20 percent over what you are currently getting . That is money out of pocket . And what my proposal says is if you still cannot afford the insurance in this new marketplace , then we are going to offer you tax credits to do so . And that will add up to the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history . That is what we are going to do . Now , when I was talking about this at that health care summit , some of you saw it I sat there for about seven hours I know you guys watched the whole thing . But some of these folks said , well , we just that is a nice idea but we just cannot afford to do that . Look , I want everybody to understand the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is . The least well among us , the poorest among us , they get their health care through Medicaid . So it is the middle class , it is working people that are getting squeezed , and that is who we have to help , and we can afford to do it . Now , it is true that providing these tax credits to middle class families and small businesses , that is going to cost some money . It is going to cost about 100 billion per year . But most of this comes from the nearly 2 . 5 trillion a year that Americans already spend on health care . It is just right now , a lot of that money is being spent badly . So with this plan , we are going to make sure the dollars we make the dollars that we spend on health care are going to make insurance more affordable and more secure . And we are going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance company . Insurance companies are making billions of dollars on subsidies from you , the taxpayer . And if we take those subsidies away , we can use them to help folks like Natoma get health insurance so she does not lose her house . And , yes , we will set a new fee on insurance companies because they stand to gain millions more customers who are buying insurance . There is nothing wrong with them giving something back . But here s the bottom line Our proposal is paid for which , by the way , is more than can be said for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they passed that big prescription drug plan that cost about as much as my health care plan and they did not pay for any of it and it went straight to the deficit . And now they are up there on their high horse talking about , well , we do not want to expand the deficit . This plan does not expand the deficit . Their plan expanded the deficit . That is why we pay for what we do . That is the responsible thing to do . Now , so let me talk about the third thing , which is my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for families , for businesses , and for the federal government . So Americans buying comparable coverage to what they have today I already said this would see premiums fall by 14 to 20 percent that is not my numbers , that is what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says for Americans who get their insurance through the workplace . How many people are getting insurance through their jobs right now Raise your hands . All right . Well , a lot of those folks , your employer it is estimated would see premiums fall by as much as 3 , 000 percent , which means they could give you a raise . We have incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rising costs of health care . We go after waste and abuse in the system , especially in Medicare . Our cost cutting measures would reduce most people s premiums and bring down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades . Those are not my numbers . Those are the numbers determined by the Congressional Budget Office . They are the referee . That is what they say , not what I say . Now , the opponents of reform , they have tried to make a lot of different arguments to stop these changes . You remember . First , they said , well , there is a government takeover of health care . Well , that was not true . Well , that was not true . Then they said , well , what about death panels Well , that turned out that did not turn out to be true . You know , the most insidious argument they are making is the idea that somehow this would hurt Medicare . I know we have got some seniors here with us today I could not tell you guys look great . I would not have guessed . But want to tell you directly This proposal adds almost a decade of solvency to Medicare . This proposal would close the gap in prescription drug coverage , called the doughnut hole you know something about that that sticks seniors with thousands of dollars in drug costs . This proposal will over time help to reduce the costs of Medicare that you pay every month . This proposal would make preventive care free so you do not have to pay out of pocket for tests to keep you healthy . So yes , we are going after the waste , the fraud , the abuse in Medicare . We are eliminating some of the insurance subsidies that should be going to your care . That is because these dollars should be spent on care for seniors , not on the care and feeding of the insurance companies through sweetheart deals . And every senior should know there is no cutting of your guaranteed Medicare benefits . Period . No ifs , ands , or buts . This proposal makes Medicare stronger , it makes the coverage better , and it makes the finances more secure . And anybody who says otherwise is either misinformed or they are trying to misinform you . Do not let them hoodwink you . They are trying to hoodwink you . So , look , Ohio , that is the proposal . And I believe Congress owes the American people a final up or down vote . We need an up or down vote . It is time to vote . And now as we get closer to the vote , there is a lot of hand wringing going on . We hear a lot of people in Washington talking about politics , talking about what this means in November , talking about the poll numbers for Democrats and Republicans . We need courage . Did you hear what somebody just said That is what we need . That is why I came here today . We need courage . We need courage . You know , in the end , this debate is about far more than politics . It comes down to what kind of country do we want to be . It is about the millions of lives that would be touched and , in some cases , saved , by making health insurance more secure and more affordable . It is about a woman who is lying in a hospital bed who just wants to be able to pay for the care she needs . And the truth is , what is at stake in this debate , it is not just our ability to solve this problem it is about our ability to solve any problem . I was talking to Dennis Kucinich on the way over here about this . I said , you know what It is been such a long time since we made government on the side of ordinary working folks where we did something for them that relieved some of their struggles that made folks who work hard every day and are doing the right thing and who are looking out for the families and contributing to their communities , that just gave them a little bit of a better chance to live out their American Dream . The American people want to know if it is still possible for Washington to look out for these interests , for their future . So what they are looking for is some courage . They are waiting for us to act . They are waiting for us to lead . They do not want us putting our finger out to the wind . They do not want us reading polls . They want us to look and see what is the best thing for America , and then do what is right . And as long as I hold this office , I intend to provide that leadership . And I know these members of Congress are going to provide that leadership . I do not know about the politics , but I know what is the right thing to do . And so I am calling on Congress to pass these reforms and I am going to sign them into law . I want some courage . I want us to do the right thing , Ohio . And with your help , we are going to make it happen . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time who still questions the power of our democracy , tonight is your answer . It is the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen by people who waited three hours and four hours , many for the very first time in their lives , because they believed that this time must be different that their voice could be that difference . It is the answer spoken by young and old , rich and poor , Democrat and Republican , black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American , gay , straight , disabled and not disabled Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States we are , and always will be , the United States of America . It is the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical , and fearful , and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day . It is been a long time coming , but tonight , because of what we did on this day , in this election , at this defining moment , change has come to America . I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain . He fought long and hard in this campaign , and he is fought even longer and harder for the country he loves . He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine , and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader . I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved , and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation s promise in the months ahead . I want to thank my partner in this journey , a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware , the Vice President elect of the United States , Joe Biden . I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years , the rock of our family and the love of my life , our nation s next First Lady , Michelle Obama . Sasha and Malia , I love you both so much , and you have earned the new puppy that is coming with us to the White House . And while she is no longer with us , I know my grandmother is watching , along with the family that made me who I am . I miss them tonight , and know that my debt to them is beyond measure . To my campaign manager David Plouffe , my chief strategist David Axelrod , and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen , and I am forever grateful for what you have sacrificed to get it done . But above all , I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to it belongs to you . I was never the likeliest candidate for this office . We did not start with much money or many endorsements . Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston . It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause . It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation s apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep from the not so young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers from the millions of Americans who volunteered , and organized , and proved that more than two centuries later , a government of the people , by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth . This is your victory . I know you did not do this just to win an election and I know you did not do it for me . You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead . For even as we celebrate tonight , we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime two wars , a planet in peril , the worst financial crisis in a century . Even as we stand here tonight , we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us . There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they will make the mortgage , or pay their doctor s bills , or save enough for college . There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair . The road ahead will be long . Our climb will be steep . We may not get there in one year or even one term , but America I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there . I promise you we as a people will get there . There will be setbacks and false starts . There are many who will not agree with every decision or policy I make as President , and we know that government cannot solve every problem . But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face . I will listen to you , especially when we disagree . And above all , I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it is been done in America for two hundred and twenty one years block by block , brick by brick , calloused hand by calloused hand . What began twenty one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night . This victory alone is not the change we seek it is only the chance for us to make that change . And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were . It cannot happen without you . So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves , but each other . Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything , it is that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers in this country , we rise or fall as one nation as one people . Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long . Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House a party founded on the values of self reliance , individual liberty , and national unity . Those are values we all share , and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight , we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress . As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours , We are not enemies , but friends . . . though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection . And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn I may not have won your vote , but I hear your voices , I need your help , and I will be your President too . And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores , from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world our stories are singular , but our destiny is shared , and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand . To those who would tear this world down we will defeat you . To those who seek peace and security we support you . And to all those who have wondered if America s beacon still burns as bright tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth , but from the enduring power of our ideals democracy , liberty , opportunity , and unyielding hope . For that is the true genius of America that America can change . Our union can be perfected . And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow . This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations . But one that is on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta . She is a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old . She was born just a generation past slavery a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky when someone like her could not vote for two reasons because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin . And tonight , I think about all that she is seen throughout her century in America the heartache and the hope the struggle and the progress the times we were told that we cannot , and the people who pressed on with that American creed Yes we can . At a time when women s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed , she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot . Yes we can . When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land , she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal , new jobs and a new sense of common purpose . Yes we can . When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world , she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved . Yes we can . She was there for the buses in Montgomery , the hoses in Birmingham , a bridge in Selma , and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that We Shall Overcome . Yes we can . A man touched down on the moon , a wall came down in Berlin , a world was connected by our own science and imagination . And this year , in this election , she touched her finger to a screen , and cast her vote , because after 106 years in America , through the best of times and the darkest of hours , she knows how America can change . Yes we can . America , we have come so far . We have seen so much . But there is so much more to do . So tonight , let us ask ourselves if our children should live to see the next century if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper , what change will they see What progress will we have made This is our chance to answer that call . This is our moment . This is our time to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many , we are one that while we breathe , we hope , and where we are met with cynicism , and doubt , and those who tell us that we cannot , we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people Yes We Can . Thank you , God bless you , and may God Bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Tonight , more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny , the task of perfecting our union moves forward . It moves forward because of you . It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams , we are an American family , and we rise or fall together , as one nation , and as one people . Tonight , in this election , you , the American people , reminded us that while our road has been hard , while our journey has been long , we have picked ourselves up , we have fought our way back , and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America , the best is yet to come . I want to thank every American who participated in this election . Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way , we have to fix that . Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign , you made your voice heard , and you made a difference . I just spoke with Governor Romney , and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign . We may have battled fiercely , but it is only because we love this country deeply , and we care so strongly about its future . From George to Lenore to their son Mitt , the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service , and that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight . In the weeks ahead , I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward . I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years , America s happy warrior the best Vice President anybody could ever hope for Joe Biden . And I would not be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago . Let me say this publicly Michelle , I have never loved you more . I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you , too , as our nation s First Lady . Sasha and Malia , before our very eyes , you are growing up to become two strong , smart , beautiful young women , just like your mom . And I am so proud of you guys . But I will say that for now , one dog is probably enough . To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best . The best ever . Some of you were new this time around , and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning . But all of you are family . No matter what you do or where you go from here , you will carry the memory of the history we made together , and you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful President . Thank you for believing all the way , through every hill , through every valley . You lifted me up the whole way . And I will always be grateful for everything that you have done and all the incredible work that you put in . I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small , even silly . And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos , or the domain of special interests . But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies , and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym , or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home , you will discover something else . You will hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who is worked his way through college , and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity . You will hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who is going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift . You will hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who is working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job , or a roof over their head when they come home . That is why we do this . That is what politics can be . That is why elections matter . It is not small it is big . It is important . Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated . We have our own opinions . Each of us has deeply held beliefs . And when we go through tough times , when we make big decisions as a country , it necessarily stirs passions , stirs up controversy . That will not change after tonight and it should not . These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty , and we can never forget that as we speak , people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter , the chance to cast their ballots like we did today . But despite all our differences , most of us share certain hopes for America s future . We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation , with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow . We want our children to live in an America that is not burdened by debt that is not weakened by inequality that is not threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet . We want to pass on a country that is safe and respected and admired around the world a nation that is defended by the strongest military on Earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being . We believe in a generous America in a compassionate America in a tolerant America , open to the dreams of an immigrant s daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag . To the young boy on the South Side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner . To the furniture worker s child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist , an engineer or entrepreneur , a diplomat or even a President . That is the future we hope for . That is the vision we share . That is where we need to go . Forward . That is where we need to go . Now , we will disagree , sometimes fiercely , about how to get there . As it has for more than two centuries , progress will come in fits and starts . It is not always a straight line . It is not always a smooth path . By itself , the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams will not end all the gridlock , or solve all our problems , or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus , and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward . But that common bond is where we must begin . Our economy is recovering . A decade of war is ending . A long campaign is now over . And whether I earned your vote or not , I have listened to you . I have learned from you . And you have made me a better President . With your stories and your struggles , I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do , and the future that lies ahead . Tonight , you voted for action , not politics as usual . You elected us to focus on your jobs , not ours . And in the coming weeks and months , I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit reforming our tax code fixing our immigration system freeing ourselves from foreign oil . We have got more work to do . But that does not mean your work is done . The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with your vote . America has never been about what can be done for us . It is about what can be done by us , together , through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government . That is the principle we were founded on . This country has more wealth than any nation , but that is not what makes us rich . We have the most powerful military in history , but that is not what makes us strong . Our university , culture are the envy of the world , but that is not what keeps the world coming to our shores . What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another , and to future generations that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights , and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism . That is what makes America great . I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America . I have seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors , and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job . I have seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb , and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them , watching their back . I have seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York , where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm . And I saw it just the other day in Mentor , Ohio , where a father told the story of his eight year old daughter , whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything , had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care . I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father , but meet this incredible daughter of his . And when he spoke to the crowd , listening to that father s story , every parent in that room had tears in their eyes , because we knew that little girl could be our own . And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright . That is who we are . That is the country I am so proud to lead as your President . And tonight , despite all the hardship we have been through , despite all the frustrations of Washington , I have never been more hopeful about our future . I have never been more hopeful about America . And I ask you to sustain that hope . I am not talking about blind optimism the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path . I am not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight . I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists , despite all the evidence to the contrary , that something better awaits us , so long as we have the courage to keep reaching , to keep working , to keep fighting . America , I believe we can build on the progress we have made , and continue to fight for new jobs , and new opportunity , and new security for the middle class . I believe we can keep the promise of our founding the idea that if you are willing to work hard , it does not matter who you are , or where you come from , or what you look like , or where you love it does not matter whether you are black or white , or Hispanic or Asian , or Native American , or young or old , or rich or poor , abled , disabled , gay or straight you can make it here in America if you are willing to try . I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggest we are not as cynical as the pundits believe we are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states . We are , and forever will be , the United States of America . And together , with your help , and God s grace , we will continue our journey forward , and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth . Thank you , America . God bless you . God bless these United States .<speech_sep>Good evening . As we speak , our nation faces a multitude of challenges . At home , our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American . Abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists . And tonight , I have returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we are waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens . On April 20th , an explosion ripped through BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana . Eleven workers lost their lives . Seventeen others were injured . And soon , nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean , oil began spewing into the water . Because there has never been a leak this size at this depth , stopping it has tested the limits of human technology . That is why just after the rig sank , I assembled a team of our nation s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge a team led by Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize winning physicist and our nation s Secretary of Energy . Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice . As a result of these efforts , we have directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology . And in the coming weeks and days , these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well . This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . Already , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days . The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . But make no mistake We will fight this spill with everything we have got for as long as it takes . We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . And we will do whatever s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . Tonight I had like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward what we are doing to clean up the oil , what we are doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf , and what we are doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again . First , the cleanup . From the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation s history an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen , who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters . We now have nearly 30 , 000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil . Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf . And I have authorized the deployment of over 17 , 000 National Guard members along the coast . These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore , they are ready to help clean the beaches , train response workers , or even help with processing claims and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible . Because of our efforts , millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning , skimming and other collection methods . Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil . We have approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore , and we are working with Alabama , Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines . As the cleanup continues , we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need . Now , a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect , and new challenges will always arise . I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip . So if something is not working , we want to hear about it . If there are problems in the operation , we will fix them . But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts , oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife . And sadly , no matter how effective our response is , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . That is why the second thing we are focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . You know , for generations , men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water . That living is now in jeopardy . I have talked to shrimpers and fishermen who do not know how they are going to support their families this year . I have seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected . I have talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back . The sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money they have lost . It is about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost . I refuse to let that happen . Tomorrow , I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company s recklessness . And this fund will not be controlled by BIn order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner , the account must and will be administered by an independent third party . Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term , it is also clear we need a long term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region . The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that is already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats . And the region still has not recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . That is why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment . I make that commitment tonight . Earlier , I asked Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy , who is also a former governor of Mississippi and a son of the Gulf Coast , to develop a long term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible . The plan will be designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists and other Gulf residents . And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region . The third part of our response plan is the steps we are taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again . A few months ago , I approved a proposal to consider new , limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken . That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig , and I want to know why . The American people deserve to know why . The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion these families deserve to know why . And so I have established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place . Already , I have issued a six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue . And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible , I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially . One place we have already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits , known as the Minerals Management Service . Over the last decade , this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves . At this agency , industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight . Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors , and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations . When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior , one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency . But it is now clear that the problem there ran much deeper , and the pace of reform was just too slow . And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency Michael Bromwich , who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General . And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry s watchdog not its partner . So one of the lessons we have learned from this spill is that we need better regulations , better safety standards , and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling . But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry , drilling for oil these days entails greater risk . After all , oil is a finite resource . We consume more than 20 percent of the world s oil , but have less than 2 percent of the world s oil reserves . And that is part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean because we are running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water . For decades , we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered . For decades , we have talked and talked about the need to end America s century long addiction to fossil fuels . And for decades , we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires . Time and again , the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight . Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America . Each day , we send nearly 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . And today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude . We cannot consign our children to this future . The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now . Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash America s innovation and seize control of our own destiny . This is not some distant vision for America . The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time , but over the last year and a half , we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry . As we speak , old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines , people are going back to work installing energy efficient windows , and small businesses are making solar panels . Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks , and families are making their homes more energy efficient . Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries . Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us . As we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs but only if we accelerate that transition . Only if we seize the moment . And only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs scientists and citizens the public and private sectors . When I was a candidate for this office , I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence . Last year , the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America s businesses . Now , there are costs associated with this transition . And there are some who believe that we cannot afford those costs right now . I say we cannot afford not to change how we produce and use energy because the long term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater . So I am happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels . Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks . Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power . Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high tech industry does on research and development and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development . All of these approaches have merit , and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead . But the one approach I will not accept is inaction . The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet . You know , the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War IThe same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon . And yet , time and again , we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom . Instead , what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny our determination to fight for the America we want for our children . Even if we are unsure exactly what that looks like . Even if we do not yet know precisely how we are going to get there . We know we will get there . It is a faith in the future that sustains us as a people . It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now . Each year , at the beginning of shrimping season , the region s fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe . It is called The Blessing of the Fleet , and today it is a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea some for weeks at a time . The ceremony goes on in good times and in bad . It took place after Katrina , and it took place a few weeks ago at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced . And still , they came and they prayed . For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition , The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers . The blessing is that He is with us always , a blessing that is granted even in the midst of the storm . The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face . This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again . What sees us through what has always seen us through is our strength , our resilience , and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it . Tonight , we pray for that courage . We pray for the people of the Gulf . And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day . Thank you , God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>
