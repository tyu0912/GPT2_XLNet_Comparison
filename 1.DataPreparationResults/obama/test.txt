Madam Speaker , Mr . Vice President , Members of Congress , the First Lady of the United States she is around here somewhere I have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great Chamber , but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here . I know that for many Americans watching right now , the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others , and rightly so . If you have not been personally affected by this recession , you probably know someone who has a friend , a neighbor , a member of your family . You do not need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis , because you live it every day . It is the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights . It is the job you thought you had retire from but now have lost , the business you built your dreams upon that is now hanging by a thread , the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope . The impact of this recession is real , and it is everywhere . But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation . The answers to our problems do not lie beyond our reach . They exist in our laboratories and our universities , in our fields and our factories , in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth . Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history , we still possess in ample measure . What is required now is for this country to pull together , confront boldly the challenges we face , and take responsibility for our future once more . Now , if we are honest with ourselves , we will admit that for too long , we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people . I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards , but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we will be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament . The fact is , our economy did not fall into decline overnight , nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank . We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy , yet we import more oil today than ever before . The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year , yet we keep delaying reform . Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for . And though all these challenges went unsolved , we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt , both as individuals and through our Government , than ever before . In other words , we have lived through an era where too often short term gains were prized over long term prosperity , where we failed to look beyond the next payment , the next quarter , or the next election . A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future . Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market . People bought homes they knew they could not afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway . And all the while , critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time , on some other day . Well , that day of reckoning has arrived , and the time to take charge of our future is here . Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy , but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity . Now is the time to jumpstart job creation , restart lending , and invest in areas like energy , health care , and education that will grow our economy , even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down . That is what my economic agenda is designed to do , and that is what I had like to talk to you about tonight . It is an agenda that begins with jobs . As soon as I took office , I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets , not because I believe in bigger Government I do not not because I am not mindful of the massive debt we have inherited I am . I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship . In fact , a failure to act would have worsened our long term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years . And that is why I pushed for quick action . And tonight I am grateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law . Over the next 2 years , this plan will save or create 3 . 5 million jobs . More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges , constructing wind turbines and solar panels , laying broadband and expanding mass transit . Because of this plan , there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids , health care professionals can continue caring for our sick . There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make . Because of this plan , 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st . Because of this plan , families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a 2 , 500 tax credit for all 4 years of college , and Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm . Now , I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work , and I understand that skepticism . Here in Washington , we have all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending . And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right . And that is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough , unprecedented oversight effort because nobody messes with Joe . I am I right They do not mess with him . I have told each of my Cabinet , as well as mayors and Governors across the country , that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend . I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud . And we have created a new web site called recovery . gov , so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent . So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track . But it is just the first step . Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly , there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system . I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight , because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family s well being . You should also know that the money you have deposited in banks across the country is safe , your insurance is secure , you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system . That is not the source of concern . The concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country , our recovery will be choked off before it even begins . You see , the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy . The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education , how stores stock their shelves , farms buy equipment , and businesses make payroll . But credit has stopped flowing the way it should . Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks . And with so much debt and so little confidence , these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households , to businesses , or even to each other . And when there is no lending , families cannot afford to buy homes or cars , so businesses are forced to make layoffs . Our economy suffers even more , and credit dries up even further . That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle , to restore confidence , and restart lending . And we will do so in several ways . First , we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans , college loans , and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running . Second , we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages . It is a plan that will not help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford , but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about . In fact , the average family who refinances today can save nearly 2 , 000 per year on their mortgage . Third , we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times . And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems , we will hold accountable those responsible , force the necessary adjustments , provide the support to clean up their balance sheets , and assure the continuity of a strong , viable institution that can serve our people and our economy . Now , I understand that on any given day , Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions . But such an approach will not solve the problem , and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all . And I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive , and this time , they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer . This time , CEOs will not be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet . Those days are over . Still , this plan will require significant resources from the Federal Government and , yes , probably more than we have already set aside . But while the cost of action will be great , I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater , for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years , but perhaps a decade . That would be worse for our deficit , worse for business , worse for you , and worse for the next generation . And I refuse to let that happen . Now , I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks , Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed . So were the American taxpayers so was So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now , especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions . I promise you , I get it . But I also know that in a time of crisis , we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment . My job our job is to solve the problem . Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility . I will not send I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive , but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that cannot pay its workers or the family that has saved and still cannot get a mortgage . That is what this is about . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . Because when credit is available again , that young family can finally buy a new home . And then some company will hire workers to build it . And then those workers will have money to spend . And if they can get a loan too , maybe they will finally buy that car or open their own business . Investors will return to the market , and American families will see their retirement secured once more . Slowly but surely , confidence will return and our economy will recover . So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary , because we cannot consign our Nation to an open ended recession . And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system . It is time to put in place tough , new , commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation , and punishes shortcuts and abuse . The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we are taking to revive our economy in the short term . But the only way to fully restore America s economic strength is to make the long term investments that will lead to new jobs , new industries , and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world . The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care , the schools that are not preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit . That is our responsibility . In the next few days , I will submit a budget to Congress . So often , we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs . I see this document differently . I see it as a vision for America , as a blueprint for our future . My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue . It reflects the stark reality of what we have inherited , a trillion dollar deficit , a financial crisis , and a costly recession . Given these realities , everyone in this Chamber , Democrats and Republicans , will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars . And that includes me . But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long term challenges . I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves , that says Government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity . For history tells a different story . History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation , this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas . In the midst of Civil War , we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry . From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age . In the wake of war and depression , the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history . And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways , an American on the Moon , and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world . In each case , Government did not supplant private enterprise it catalyzed private enterprise . It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive . We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal . Now we must be that nation again , and that is why , even as it cuts back on programs we do not need , the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future energy , health care , and education . It begins with energy . We know the country that harnesses the power of clean , renewable energy will lead the 21st century . And yet , it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient . We invented solar technology , but we have fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it . New plug in hybrids roll off our assembly lines , but they will run on batteries made in Korea . Well , I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders , and I know you do not either . It is time for America to lead again . Thanks to our recovery plan , we will double this Nation s supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years . We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history , an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology . We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country . And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills . But to truly transform our economy , to protect our security , and save our planet from the ravages of climate change , we need to ultimately make clean , renewable energy the profitable kind of energy . So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America . That is what we need . And to support that innovation , we will invest 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power , advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . Speaking of our auto industry , everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink . We should not , and will not , protect them from their own bad practices . But we are committed to the goal of a retooled , reimagined auto industry that can compete and win . Millions of jobs depend on it scores of communities depend on it . And I believe the Nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it . Now , none of this will come without cost , nor will it be easy . But this is America . We do not do what is easy . We do what is necessary to move this country forward . And for that same reason , we must also address the crushing cost of health care . This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds . By the end of the year , it could cause 1 . 5 million Americans to lose their homes . In the last 8 years , premiums have grown four times faster than wages . And in each of these years , 1 million more Americans have lost their health insurance . It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas . And it is one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget . Given these facts , we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold . We cannot afford to do it . It is time . Already , we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than we have done in the last decade . When it was days old , this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time . Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records , a new technology that will reduce errors , bring down costs , ensure privacy , and save lives . It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American , including me , by seeking a cure for cancer in our time . And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care , because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control . This budget builds on these reforms . It includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform , a down payment on the principle that we must have quality , affordable health care for every American . It is a commitment that is paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue . And it is a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come . Now , there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform , and that is why I am bringing together businesses and workers , doctors and health care providers , Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week . I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process . Once again , it will be hard . But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform , the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough . So let there be no doubt Health care reform cannot wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America . In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge , a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity , it is a prerequisite . Right now , three quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma . And yet , just over half of our citizens have that level of education . We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation , and half of the students who begin college never finish . This is a prescription for economic decline , because we know the countries that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow . That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education , from the day they are born to the day they begin a career . That is a promise we have to make to the children of America . Already , we have made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan . We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality , because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life . We have made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students 7 million . And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children s progress . But we know that our schools do not just need more resources , they need more reform . And that is why this budget creates new teachers new incentives for teacher performance , pathways for advancement , and rewards for success . We will invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps , and we will expand our commitment to charter schools . It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work . But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it . So tonight I ask every American to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training . This can be community college or a 4 year school , vocational training or an apprenticeship . But whatever the training may be , every American will need to get more than a high school diploma . And dropping out of high school is no longer an option . It is not just quitting on yourself , it is quitting on your country , and this country needs and values the talents of every American . That is why we will support we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans to complete college and meet a new goal . By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . That is a goal we can meet . That is a goal we can meet . Now , I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever , which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country , we will make sure that you can afford a higher education . And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations , I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch , as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country , Senator Edward Kennedy . These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children , but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them . In the end , there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent , for a mother or father who will attend those parent teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the Tput away the video games , read to their child . I speak to you not just as a President , but as a father , when I say that responsibility for our children s education must begin at home . That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue that is an American issue . There is , of course , another responsibility we have to our children . And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay . That is critical . I agree , absolutely . See , I know we can get some consensus in here . With the deficit we inherited , the cost of the crisis we face , and the long term challenges we must meet , it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers , we do what it takes to bring this deficit down . That is critical . Now , I am proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks , and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities . And yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office . My administration has also begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs . As you can imagine , this is a process that will take some time . But we have already identified 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . In this budget , we will end education programs that do not work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that do not need them . We will eliminate the no bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we are not paying for cold war era weapons systems we do not use . We will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that does not make our seniors any healthier . We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax Code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas . In order to save our children from a future of debt , we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Now , let me be clear let me be absolutely clear , because I know you will end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people If your family earns less than 250 , 000 a year , a quarter million dollars a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . I repeat Not one single dime . In fact not a dime in fact , the recovery plan provides a tax cut that is right , a tax cut for 95 percent of working families . And by the way , these checks are on the way . Now , to preserve our long term fiscal health , we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security . Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come . And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security , while creating tax free universal savings accounts for all Americans . Finally , because we are also suffering from a deficit of trust , I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget . That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules . And for the first time , that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . For 7 years , we have been a nation at war . No longer will we hide its price . Along with our outstanding national security team , I am now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars , and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war . And with our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat extremism , because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world . We will not allow it . As we meet here tonight , our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy . To each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence , Americans are united in sending one message We honor your service we are inspired by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding support . To relieve the strain on our forces , my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines . And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve , we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned . To overcome extremism , we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend , because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America . And that is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists . Because living our values does not make us weaker , it makes us safer and it makes us stronger . And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture . We can make that commitment here tonight . In words and deeds , we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun . For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone , but the world cannot meet them without America . We cannot shun the negotiating table , nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm . We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand . To seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors , we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort . To meet the challenges of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear proliferation , from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty we will strengthen old alliances , forge new ones , and use all elements of our national power . And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope , we are working with the nations of the G 20 to restore confidence in our financial system , avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism , and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe . For the world depends on us having a strong economy , just as our economy depends on the strength of the world s . As we stand at this crossroads of history , the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us , watching to see what we do with this moment , waiting for us to lead . Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times . It is a tremendous burden , but also a great privilege , one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans . For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill . I know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth , to become cynical and doubtful , consumed with the petty and the trivial . But in my life , I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places , that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity , but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are anything but ordinary . I think of Leonard Abess , a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company , took a 60 million bonus , and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him , plus another 72 who used to work for him . He did not tell anyone , but when the local newspaper found out , he simply said , I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old . It did not feel right getting the money myself . I think about Greensburg , Kansas , a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado , but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community , how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay . The tragedy was terrible , said one of the men who helped them rebuild . But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity . I think about Ty Sheoma Bethea , the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon , South Carolina , a place where the ceilings leak , the paint peels off the walls , and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom . She had been told that her school is hopeless , but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber . She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp . The letter asks us for help and says We are just students trying to become lawyers , doctors , Congressmen like yourself , and one day President , so we can make a change to not just the State of South Carolina but also the world . We are not quitters . That is what she said We are not quitters . These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here . They tell us that even in the most trying times , amid the most difficult circumstances , there is a generosity , a resilience , a decency , and a determination that perseveres , a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity . Their resolve must be our inspiration . Their concerns must be our cause . And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us . I know look , I know that we have not agreed on every issue thus far . There are surely times in the future where we will part ways . But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed . I know that . That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done . That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground . And if we do , if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths of this crisis , if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity , if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit , then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed , in the words that are carved into this very Chamber , something worthy to be remembered . Thank you . God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America . Thank you .Good evening . To the United States Corps of Cadets , to the men and women of our Armed Services , and to my fellow Americans I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan the nature of our commitment there , the scope of our interests , and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion . It is an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security , and to represent what is finest about our country . To address these important issues , it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place . We did not ask for this fight . On September 11 , 2001 , 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3 , 000 people . They struck at our military and economic nerve centers . They took the lives of innocent men , women , and children without regard to their faith or race or station . Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers onboard one of those flights , they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington , and killed many more . As we know , these men belonged to al Qaeda a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam , one of the world s great religions , to justify the slaughter of innocents . Al Qaeda s base of operations was in Afghanistan , where they were harbored by the Taliban a ruthless , repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war , and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere . Just days after 9 11 , Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them an authorization that continues to this day . The vote in the Senate was 98 to nothing . The vote in the House was 420 to 1 . For the first time in its history , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all . And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9 11 attacks . America , our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda s terrorist network and to protect our common security . Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden we sent our troops into Afghanistan . Within a matter of months , al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed . The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels . A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope . At a conference convened by the N . , a provisional government was established under President Hamid Karzai . And an International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war torn country . Then , in early 2003 , the decision was made to wage a second war , in Iraq . The wrenching debate over the Iraq war is well known and need not be repeated here . It is enough to say that for the next six years , the Iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops , our resources , our diplomacy , and our national attention and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world . Today , after extraordinary costs , we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end . We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer , and all of our troops by the end of 2011 . That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and women in uniform . Thanks to their courage , grit and perseverance , we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future , and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people . But while we have achieved hard earned milestones in Iraq , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated . After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002 , al Qaeda s leadership established a safe haven there . Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people , it is been hampered by corruption , the drug trade , an under developed economy , and insufficient security forces . Over the last several years , the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda , as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government . Gradually , the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory in Afghanistan , while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorism against the Pakistani people . Now , throughout this period , our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq . When I took office , we had just over 32 , 000 Americans serving in Afghanistan , compared to 160 , 000 in Iraq at the peak of the war . Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban , but these reinforcements did not arrive . And that is why , shortly after taking office , I approved a longstanding request for more troops . After consultations with our allies , I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan . I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting , dismantling , and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies , and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts . Since then , we have made progress on some important objectives . High ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed , and we have stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda worldwide . In Pakistan , that nation s army has gone on its largest offensive in years . In Afghanistan , we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election , and although it was marred by fraud that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan s laws and constitution . Yet huge challenges remain . Afghanistan is not lost , but for several years it has moved backwards . There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown , but the Taliban has gained momentum . Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9 11 , but they retain their safe havens along the border . And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population . Our new commander in Afghanistan General McChrystal has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated . In short The status quo is not sustainable . As cadets , you volunteered for service during this time of danger . Some of you fought in Afghanistan . Some of you will deploy there . As your Commander in Chief , I owe you a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of your service . And that is why , after the Afghan voting was completed , I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy . Now , let me be clear There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 , so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period . Instead , the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions , and to explore all the different options , along with my national security team , our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan , and our key partners . And given the stakes involved , I owed the American people and our troops no less . This review is now complete . And as Commander in Chief , I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30 , 000 troops to Afghanistan . After 18 months , our troops will begin to come home . These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative , while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan . I do not make this decision lightly . I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force , and always consider the long term consequences of our actions . We have been at war now for eight years , at enormous cost in lives and resources . Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters , and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort . And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home . Most of all , I know that this decision asks even more of you a military that , along with your families , has already borne the heaviest of all burdens . As President , I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars . I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed . I visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed . I have traveled to Dover to meet the flag draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place . I see firsthand the terrible wages of war . If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan , I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow . So , no , I do not make this decision lightly . I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan . This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda . It is from here that we were attacked on 9 11 , and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak . This is no idle danger no hypothetical threat . In the last few months alone , we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror . And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards , and al Qaeda can operate with impunity . We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and to do that , we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region . Of course , this burden is not ours alone to bear . This is not just America s war . Since 9 11 , al Qaeda s safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali . The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered . And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear armed Pakistan , because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons , and we have every reason to believe that they would use them . These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies . Our overarching goal remains the same to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future . To meet that goal , we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan . We must deny al Qaeda a safe haven . We must reverse the Taliban s momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government . And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan s security forces and government so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan s future . We will meet these objectives in three ways . First , we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban s momentum and increase Afghanistan s capacity over the next 18 months . The 30 , 000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 the fastest possible pace so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers . They will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces , and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight . And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans . Because this is an international effort , I have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies . Some have already provided additional troops , and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead . Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan . And now , we must come together to end this war successfully . For what is at stake is not simply a test of NATO s credibility what is at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world . But taken together , these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces , and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011 . Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly , taking into account conditions on the ground . We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul . But it will be clear to the Afghan government and , more importantly , to the Afghan people that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country . Second , we will work with our partners , the United Nations , and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy , so that the government can take advantage of improved security . This effort must be based on performance . The days of providing a blank check are over . President Karzai s inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction . And going forward , we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance . We will support Afghan ministries , governors , and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people . We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable . And we will also focus our assistance in areas such as agriculture that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people . The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades . They have been confronted with occupation by the Soviet Union , and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes . So tonight , I want the Afghan people to understand America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering . We have no interest in occupying your country . We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens . And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the day when our troops will leave and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner , and never your patron . Third , we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan . We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country . But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan . That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border . In the past , there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight , and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence . But in recent years , as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad , it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism . Public opinion has turned . The Pakistani army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan . And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy . In the past , we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly . Those days are over . Moving forward , we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interest , mutual respect , and mutual trust . We will strengthen Pakistan s capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries , and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear . America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan s democracy and development . We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting . And going forward , the Pakistan people must know America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan s security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent , so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed . These are the three core elements of our strategy a military effort to create the conditions for a transition a civilian surge that reinforces positive action and an effective partnership with Pakistan . I recognize there are a range of concerns about our approach . So let me briefly address a few of the more prominent arguments that I have heard , and which I take very seriously . First , there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam . They argue that it cannot be stabilized , and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing . I believe this argument depends on a false reading of history . Unlike Vietnam , we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action . Unlike Vietnam , we are not facing a broad based popular insurgency . And most importantly , unlike Vietnam , the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border . To abandon this area now and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies . Second , there are those who acknowledge that we cannot leave Afghanistan in its current state , but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have . But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through , and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there . It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan , because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over . Finally , there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility . Indeed , some call for a more dramatic and open ended escalation of our war effort one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade . I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost , and what we need to achieve to secure our interests . Furthermore , the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government . It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security , and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan . As President , I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility , our means , or our interests . And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces . I do not have the luxury of committing to just one . Indeed , I am mindful of the words of President Eisenhower , who in discussing our national security said , Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs . Over the past several years , we have lost that balance . We have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy . In the wake of an economic crisis , too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills . Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children . Meanwhile , competition within the global economy has grown more fierce . So we cannot simply afford to ignore the price of these wars . All told , by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars . Going forward , I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly . Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion for the military this year , and I will work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit . But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility , we must rebuild our strength here at home . Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power . It pays for our military . It underwrites our diplomacy . It taps the potential of our people , and allows investment in new industry . And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last . That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open ended because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own . Now , let me be clear None of this will be easy . The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly , and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan . It will be an enduring test of our free society , and our leadership in the world . And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century , our effort will involve disorderly regions , failed states , diffuse enemies . So as a result , America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict not just how we wage wars . We will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power . Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships . And we cannot count on military might alone . We have to invest in our homeland security , because we cannot capture or kill every violent extremist abroad . We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence , so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks . We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction . And that is why I have made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists , to stop the spread of nuclear weapons , and to pursue the goal of a world without them because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapons true security will come for those who reject them . We will have to use diplomacy , because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone . I have spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships . And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim world one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict , and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity . And finally , we must draw on the strength of our values for the challenges that we face may have changed , but the things that we believe in must not . That is why we must promote our values by living them at home which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay . And we must make it clear to every man , woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights , and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples . That is who we are . That is the source , the moral source , of America s authority . Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt , and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great grandparents , our country has borne a special burden in global affairs . We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents . We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies . We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings . We have not always been thanked for these efforts , and we have at times made mistakes . But more than any other nation , the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades a time that , for all its problems , has seen walls come down , and markets open , and billions lifted from poverty , unparalleled scientific progress and advancing frontiers of human liberty . For unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought world domination . Our union was founded in resistance to oppression . We do not seek to occupy other nations . We will not claim another nation s resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours . What we have fought for what we continue to fight for is a better future for our children and grandchildren . And we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity . As a country , we are not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Roosevelt was President . Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom . And now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age . In the end , our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms . It derives from our people from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries from the teachers that will educate our children , and the service of those who work in our communities at home from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people , by the people , and for the people a reality on this Earth . This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue nor should we . But I also know that we , as a country , cannot sustain our leadership , nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time , if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse . It is easy to forget that when this war began , we were united bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack , and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear . I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again . I believe with every fiber of my being that we as Americans can still come together behind a common purpose . For our values are not simply words written into parchment they are a creed that calls us together , and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation , as one people . America we are passing through a time of great trial . And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear that our cause is just , our resolve unwavering . We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might , and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer , a world that is more secure , and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes . Thank you . God bless you . May God bless the United States of America . Thank you very much . Thank you .Madam Speaker , Vice President Biden , Members of Congress , and the American people When I spoke here last winter , this Nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . We were losing an average of 700 , 000 jobs per month , credit was frozen , and our financial system was on the verge of collapse . Now , as any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you , we are by no means out of the woods . A full and vibrant recovery is still many months away . And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them , until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive , until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes . That is our ultimate goal . But thanks to the bold and decisive action we have taken since January , I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink . I want to thank the Members of this body for your efforts and your support in these last several months , and especially those who have taken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery . I also want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve during this trying time for our Nation . But we did not come here just to clean up crises . We came here to build a future . So tonight , I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future , and that is the issue of health care . I am not the first President to take up this cause , but I am determined to be the last . It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform , and ever since , nearly every President and Congress , whether Democrat or Republican , has attempted to meet this challenge in some way . A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell , Sr . , in 1943 . Sixty five years later , his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session . Our collective failure to meet this challenge , year after year , decade after decade , has led us to the breaking point . Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy . These are not primarily people on welfare these are middle class Americans . Some cannot get insurance on the job . Others are self employed and cannot afford it since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer . Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or too expensive to cover . We are the only democracy the only advanced democracy on Earth the only wealthy nation that allows such hardship for millions of its people . There are now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage . In just a 2 year period , one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point . And every day , 14 , 000 Americans lose their coverage . In other words , it can happen to anyone . But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem for the uninsured . Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today . More and more Americans worry that if you move , lose your job , or change your job , you will lose your health insurance too . More and more Americans pay their premiums only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick or will not pay the full cost of care . It happens every day . One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he had not reported gallstones that he did not even know about . They delayed his treatment , and he died because of it . Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne . By the time she had her insurance reinstated , her breast cancer had more than doubled in size . That is heart breaking , it is wrong , and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America . Then there is the problem of rising cost . We spend one and a half times more per person on health care than any other country , but we are not any healthier for it . This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages . It is why so many employers , especially small businesses , are forcing their employers employees to pay more for insurance or are dropping their coverage entirely . It is why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place and why American businesses that compete internationally , like our automakers , are at a huge disadvantage . And it is why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it , about 1 , 000 per year that pays for somebody else s emergency room and charitable care . Finally , our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers . When health care costs grow at the rate they have , it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid . If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs , we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other Government program combined . Put simply , our health care problem is our deficit problem . Nothing else even comes close . Nothing else . Now , these are the facts . Nobody disputes them . We know we must reform this system . The question is how . Now , there are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single payer system like Canada s , where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the Government provide coverage for everybody . On the right , there are those who argue that we should end employer based systems and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own . I have said I have to say that there are arguments to be made for both these approaches . But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have . Since health care represents one sixth of our economy , I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what does not , rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch . And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the several past several months . During that time , we have seen Washington at its best and at its worst . We have seen many in this Chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform . Of the five committees asked to develop bills , four have completed their work , and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week . That has never happened before . Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses , hospitals , seniors groups , and even drug companies , many of whom opposed reform in the past . And there is agreement in this Chamber on about 80 percent of what needs to be done , putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been . But what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have towards their own government . Instead of honest debate , we have seen scare tactics . Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise . Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short term political points , even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long term challenge . And out of this blizzard of charges and countercharges , confusion has reigned . Well , the time for bickering is over . The time for games has passed . Now is the season for action . Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do . Now is the time to deliver on health care . Now is the time to deliver on health care . The plan I am announcing tonight would meet three basic goals It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance it will provide insurance for those who do not and it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families , our businesses , and our Government . It is a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge , not just government , not just insurance companies , but everybody , including employers and individuals . And it is a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen , from Democrats and Republicans , and yes , from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election . Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan . First , if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job or Medicare or Medicaid or the Vnothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have . Let me repeat this Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have . What this plan will do is make the insurance you have work better for you . Under this plan , it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition . As soon as I sign this bill , it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it the most . They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or in a lifetime . We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out of pocket expenses , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they get sick . And insurance companies will be required to cover , with no extra charge , routine checkups and preventive care , like mammograms and colonoscopies , because there is no reason we should not be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse . That makes sense , it saves money , and it saves lives . Now , that is what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan , more security and more stability . Now , if you are one of the tens of millions of Americans who do not currently have health insurance , the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality , affordable choices . If you lose your job or you change your job , you will be able to get coverage . If you strike out on your own and start a small business , you will be able to get coverage . We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange , a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices . Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers . As one big group , these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage . This is how large companies and Government employees get affordable insurance , it is how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance , and it is time to give every American the same opportunity that we give ourselves . Now , for those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower priced insurance available in the exchange , we will provide tax credits , the size of which will be based on your need . And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned . This exchange will take effect in 4 years , which will give us time to do it right . In the meantime , for those Americans who cannot get insurance today because they have preexisting medical conditions , we will immediately offer low cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill . This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign , it is a good idea now , and we should all embrace it . Now , even if we provide these affordable options , there may be those , especially the young and the healthy , who still want to take the risk and go without coverage . There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers by giving them coverage . The problem is , such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money . If there are affordable options and people still do not sign up for health insurance , it means we pay for these people s expensive emergency room visits . If some businesses do not provide workers health care , it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors . And unless everybody does their part , many of the insurance reforms we seek , especially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions , just cannot be achieved . And that is why under my plan , individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance , just as most States require you to carry auto insurance . Likewise , businesses will be required to either offer their workers health care or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers . There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still cannot afford coverage , and 95 percent of all small businesses , because of their size and narrow profit margin , would be exempt from these requirements . But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees . Improving our health care system only works if everybody does their part . And while there remain some significant details to be ironed out , I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined consumer protections for those with insurance , an exchange that allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable coverage , and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance . And I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life as well as the economy as a whole . Still , given all the misinformation that is been spread over the past few months , I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform . So tonight I want to address some of the key controversies that are still out there . Some of people s concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost . The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts , but by prominent politicians , that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens . Now , such a charge would be laughable if it were not so cynical and irresponsible . It is a lie , plain and simple . Now , there are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants . This too is false . The reforms I am proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally . Representative Joe Wilson . You lie The President . It is not true . And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up , under our plan , no Federal dollars will be used to fund abortions , and Federal conscience laws will remain in place . Now , my health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a Government takeover of the entire health care system . As proof , critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly sponsored insurance option , administered by the Government just like Medicaid or Medicare . So let me set the record straight here . My guiding principle is , and always has been , that consumers do better when there is choice and competition . That is how the market works . Unfortunately , in 34 States , 75 percent of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies . In Alabama , almost 90 percent is controlled by just one company . And without competition , the price of insurance goes up and quality goes down . And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly by cherry picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest , by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage , and by jacking up rates . Insurance executives do not do this because they are bad people they do it because it is profitable . As one former insurance executive testified before Congress , insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill , they are rewarded for it . All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called Wall Street s relentless profit expectations . Now , I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of business . They provide a legitimate service and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors . I just want to hold them accountable . And the insurance reforms that I have already mentioned would do just that . But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not for profit public option available in the insurance exchange . Now , let me be clear . Let me be clear . It would only be an option for those who do not have insurance . No one would be forced to choose it , and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance . In fact , based on Congressional Budget Office estimates , we believe that less than 5 percent of Americans would sign up . Despite all this , the insurance companies and their allies do not like this idea . They argue that these private companies cannot fairly compete with the Government . And they had be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option . But they will not be . I have insisted that like any private insurance company , the public insurance option would have to be self sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects . But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits and excessive administrative costs and executive salaries , it could provide a good deal for consumers and would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better , the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities . Now , it is worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I have proposed tonight . But its impact should not be exaggerated by the left or the right or the media . It is only one part of my plan and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles . To my progressive friends , I would remind you that for decades , the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage available for those without it . The public option is only a means to that end , and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal . And to my Republican friends , I say that rather than making wild claims about a Government takeover of health care , we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have . Now , for example , some have suggested that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies . Others have proposed a co op or another nonprofit entity to administer the plan . These are all constructive ideas worth exploring . But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans cannot find affordable coverage , we will provide you with a choice . And I will make sure that no Government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need . Finally , let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me , to Members of this Chamber , and to the public , and that is how we pay for this plan . And here s what you need to know . First , I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits , either now or in the future . I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit , now or in the future , period . And to prove that I am serious , there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we have promised do not materialize . Now , part of the reason I faced a trillion dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for , from the Iraq war to tax breaks for the wealthy . I will not make that same mistake with health care . Second , we have estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system , a system that is currently full of waste and abuse . Right now , too much of the hard earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care do not make us any healthier . That is not my judgment it is the judgment of medical professionals across this country . And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid . In fact , I want to speak directly to seniors for a moment , because Medicare is another issue that is been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate . More than four decades ago , this Nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work , our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years . That is how Medicare was born , and it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next . And that is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan . The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies , subsidies that do everything to pad their profits but do not improve the care of seniors . And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead . Now , these steps will ensure that you , America s seniors , get the benefits you have been promised . They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations . And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pockets for prescription drugs . That is what this plan will do for you . So do not pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut , especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past and just this year supported a budget that would essentially have turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program . That will not happen on my watch . I will protect Medicare . Now , because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system , making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody . We have long known that some places , like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania , offer high quality care at costs below average . So the commission can help encourage the adoption of these commonsense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system , everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors . Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan . Now , much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers . And this reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies , which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money , an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts . And according to these same experts , this modest change could help hold down the costs of health care for all of us in the long run . Now , finally , many in this Chamber , particularly on the Republican side of the aisle , have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care . Now there you go . There you go . Now , I do not believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet , but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs . So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine . I know that the Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual States to test these ideas . I think it is a good idea , and I am directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today . Now , add it all up , and the plan I am proposing will cost around 900 billion over 10 years , less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration . Now , most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent , but spent badly , in the existing health care system . The plan will not add to our deficit . The middle class will realize greater security , not higher taxes . And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one tenth of 1 percent each year one tenth of 1 percent it will actually reduce the deficit by 4 trillion over the long term . Now , this is the plan I am proposing . It is a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight , Democrats and Republicans . And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead . If you come to me with a serious set of proposals , I will be there to listen . My door is always open . But know this I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it is better politics to kill this plan than to improve it . I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are . If you misrepresent what is in this plan , we will call you out . And I will not accept the status quo as a solution . Not this time . Not now . Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing . Our deficit will grow , more families will go bankrupt , more businesses will close , more Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it the most , and more will die as a result . We know these things to be true . That is why we cannot fail , because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed , the ones who suffer silently and the ones who share their stories with us at town halls , in e mails , and in letters . I received one of those letters a few days ago . It was from our beloved friend and colleague Ted Kennedy . He had written it back in May , shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal . He asked that it be delivered upon his death . In it he spoke about what a happy time his last months were , thanks to the love and support of family and friends , his wife Vicki , his amazing children , who are all here tonight . And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform , that great unfinished business of our society , he called it , would finally pass . He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity , but he also reminded me that it concerns more than material things . What we face , he wrote , is above all a moral issue at stake are not just the details of policy , but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country . I have thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days the character of our country . One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self reliance , our rugged individualism , our fierce defense of freedom , and our healthy skepticism of government . And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and , yes , sometimes angry , debate . That is our history . For some of Ted Kennedy s critics , his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty . In their minds , his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government . But those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here , people of both parties , know that what drove him was something more . His friend Orrin Hatch , he knows that . They worked together to provide children with health insurance . His friend John McCain knows that . They worked together on a patient s bill of rights . His friend Chuck Grassley knows that . They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities . On issues like these , Ted Kennedy s passion was born not of some rigid ideology , but of his own experience . It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer . He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick . And he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance , what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent , there is something that could make you better , but I just cannot afford it . That large heartedness , that concern and regard for the plight of others , is not a partisan feeling it is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling . It too is part of the American character , our ability to stand in other people s shoes , a recognition that we are all in this together , and when fortune turns against one of us , others are there to lend a helping hand , a belief that in this country , hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play , and an acknowledgment that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise . This has always been the history of our progress . In 1935 , when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away , there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism , but the men and women of Congress stood fast , and we are all the better for it . In 1965 , when some argued that Medicare represented a Government takeover of health care , Members of Congress , Democrats and Republicans , did not back down . They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind . You see , our predecessors understood that government could not , and should not , solve every problem . They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom . But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little , that without the leavening hand of wise policy , markets can crash , monopolies can stifle competition , the vulnerable can be exploited . And they knew that when any government measure , no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial , is subject to scorn when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un American , when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom , and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter , that at that point we do not merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges , we lose something essential about ourselves . That was true then it remains true today . I understand how difficult this health care debate has been . I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them . I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road , to defer reform one more year or one more election or one more term . But that is not what the moment calls for . That is not what we came here to do . We did not come to fear the future . We came here to shape it . I still believe we can act even when it is hard . I still believe . I still believe that we can act when it is hard . I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility and gridlock with progress . I still believe we can do great things and that here and now we will meet history s test , because that is who we are . That is our calling . That is our character . Thank you , God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress , as well as your new Speaker , John Boehner . And as we mark this occasion , we are also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber , and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend Gabby Giffords . It is no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years . The debates have been contentious we have fought fiercely for our beliefs . And that is a good thing . That is what a robust democracy demands . That is what helps set us apart as a nation . But there is a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause . Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate , Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from , each of us is a part of something greater something more consequential than party or political preference . We are part of the American family . We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found , we are still bound together as one people that we share common hopes and a common creed that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children , and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled . That , too , is what sets us apart as a nation . Now , by itself , this simple recognition will not usher in a new era of cooperation . What comes of this moment is up to us . What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight , but whether we can work together tomorrow . I believe we can . And I believe we must . That is what the people who sent us here expect of us . With their votes , they have determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties . New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans . We will move forward together , or not at all for the challenges we face are bigger than party , and bigger than politics . At stake right now is not who wins the next election after all , we just had an election . At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country , or somewhere else . It is whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded . It is whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map , but the light to the world . We are poised for progress . Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known , the stock market has come roaring back . Corporate profits are up . The economy is growing again . But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone . We measure progress by the success of our people . By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer . By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise . By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children . That is the project the American people want us to work on . Together . We did that in December . Thanks to the tax cuts we passed , Americans paychecks are a little bigger today . Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year . And these steps , taken by Democrats and Republicans , will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year . But we have to do more . These steps we have taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession , but to win the future , we will need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making . Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown . You did not always need a degree , and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors . If you worked hard , chances are you had have a job for life , with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion . Maybe you had even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company . That world has changed . And for many , the change has been painful . I have seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories , and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets . I have heard it in the frustrations of Americans who have seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game . They are right . The rules have changed . In a single generation , revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live , work and do business . Steel mills that once needed 1 , 000 workers can now do the same work with 100 . Today , just about any company can set up shop , hire workers , and sell their products wherever there is an Internet connection . Meanwhile , nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own , they could compete in this new world . And so they started educating their children earlier and longer , with greater emphasis on math and science . They are investing in research and new technologies . Just recently , China became the home to the world s largest private solar research facility , and the world s fastest computer . So , yes , the world has changed . The competition for jobs is real . But this should not discourage us . It should challenge us . Remember for all the hits we have taken these last few years , for all the naysayers predicting our decline , America still has the largest , most prosperous economy in the world . No workers no workers are more productive than ours . No country has more successful companies , or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs . We are the home to the world s best colleges and universities , where more students come to study than any place on Earth . What is more , we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny . That is why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here . It is why our students do not just memorize equations , but answer questions like What do you think of that idea What would you change about the world What do you want to be when you grow up The future is ours to win . But to get there , we cannot just stand still . As Robert Kennedy told us , The future is not a gift . It is an achievement . Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat . It has required each generation to sacrifice , and struggle , and meet the demands of a new age . And now it is our turn . We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time . We need to out innovate , out educate , and out build the rest of the world . We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business . We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government . That is how our people will prosper . That is how we will win the future . And tonight , I had like to talk about how we get there . The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation . None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from . Thirty years ago , we could not know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution . What we can do what America does better than anyone else is spark the creativity and imagination of our people . We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers of Google and Facebook . In America , innovation does not just change our lives . It is how we make our living . Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation . But because it is not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research , throughout our history , our government has provided cutting edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need . That is what planted the seeds for the Internet . That is what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPJust think of all the good jobs from manufacturing to retail that have come from these breakthroughs . Half a century ago , when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik , we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon . The science was not even there yet . NASA did not exist . But after investing in better research and education , we did not just surpass the Soviets we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs . This is our generation s Sputnik moment . Two years ago , I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we have not seen since the height of the Space Race . And in a few weeks , I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal . We will invest in biomedical research , information technology , and especially clean energy technology an investment that will strengthen our security , protect our planet , and create countless new jobs for our people . Already , we are seeing the promise of renewable energy . Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company . After September 11th , they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon . But half of their factory went unused , and the recession hit them hard . Today , with the help of a government loan , that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country . In Robert s words , We reinvented ourselves . That is what Americans have done for over 200 years reinvented ourselves . And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers , we have begun to reinvent our energy policy . We are not just handing out money . We are issuing a challenge . We are telling America s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields , and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy , we will fund the Apollo projects of our time . At the California Institute of Technology , they are developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars . At Oak Ridge National Laboratory , they are using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities . With more research and incentives , we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels , and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 . We need to get behind this innovation . And to help pay for it , I am asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies . I do not know if I do not know if you have noticed , but they are doing just fine on their own . So instead of subsidizing yesterday s energy , let us invest in tomorrow s . Now , clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they are selling . So tonight , I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal By 2035 , 80 percent of America s electricity will come from clean energy sources . Some folks want wind and solar . Others want nuclear , clean coal and natural gas . To meet this goal , we will need them all and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen . Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America s success . But if we want to win the future if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas then we also have to win the race to educate our kids . Think about it . Over the next 10 years , nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education . And yet , as many as a quarter of our students are not even finishing high school . The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations . America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree . And so the question is whether all of us as citizens , and as parents are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed . That responsibility begins not in our classrooms , but in our homes and communities . It is family that first instills the love of learning in a child . Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done . We need to teach our kids that it is not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated , but the winner of the science fair . We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or Pbut of hard work and discipline . Our schools share this responsibility . When a child walks into a classroom , it should be a place of high expectations and high performance . But too many schools do not meet this test . That is why instead of just pouring money into a system that is not working , we launched a competition called Race to the Top . To all 50 states , we said , If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement , we will show you the money . Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation . For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year , it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning . And these standards were developed , by the way , not by Washington , but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country . And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and focused on what is best for our kids . You see , we know what is possible from our children when reform is not just a top down mandate , but the work of local teachers and principals , school boards and communities . Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver . Three years ago , it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado located on turf between two rival gangs . But last May , 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma . Most will be the first in their families to go to college . And after the first year of the school s transformation , the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said , Thank you , Ms . Waters , for showing that we are smart and we can make it . That is what good schools can do , and we want good schools all across the country . Let us also remember that after parents , the biggest impact on a child s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom . In South Korea , teachers are known as nation builders . Here in America , it is time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect . We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones . And over the next 10 years , with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms , we want to prepare 100 , 000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math . In fact , to every young person listening tonight who is contemplating their career choice If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher . Your country needs you . Of course , the education race does not end with a high school diploma . To compete , higher education must be within the reach of every American . That is why we have ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks , and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students . And this year , I ask Congress to go further , and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth 10 , 000 for four years of college . It is the right thing to do . Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today s fast changing economy , we are also revitalizing America s community colleges . Last month , I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina . Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town . One mother of two , a woman named Kathy Proctor , had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old . And she told me she is earning her degree in biotechnology now , at 55 years old , not just because the furniture jobs are gone , but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams , too . As Kathy said , I hope it tells them to never give up . If we take these steps if we raise expectations for every child , and give them the best possible chance at an education , from the day they are born until the last job they take we will reach the goal that I set two years ago By the end of the decade , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . One last point about education . Today , there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens . Some are the children of undocumented workers , who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents . They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag , and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation . Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities . But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees , we send them back home to compete against us . It makes no sense . Now , I strongly believe that we should take on , once and for all , the issue of illegal immigration . And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders , enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows . I know that debate will be difficult . I know it will take time . But tonight , let us agree to make that effort . And let us stop expelling talented , responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business , who could be further enriching this nation . The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America . To attract new businesses to our shores , we need the fastest , most reliable ways to move people , goods , and information from high speed rail to high speed Internet . Our infrastructure used to be the best , but our lead has slipped . South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do . Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do . China is building faster trains and newer airports . Meanwhile , when our own engineers graded our nation s infrastructure , they gave us a D . We have to do better . America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad , brought electricity to rural communities , constructed the Interstate Highway System . The jobs created by these projects did not just come from laying down track or pavement . They came from businesses that opened near a town s new train station or the new off ramp . So over the last two years , we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century , a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard hit construction industry . And tonight , I am proposing that we redouble those efforts . We will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges . We will make sure this is fully paid for , attract private investment , and pick projects based what is best for the economy , not politicians . Within 25 years , our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high speed rail . This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car . For some trips , it will be faster than flying without the pat down . As we speak , routes in California and the Midwest are already underway . Within the next five years , we will make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans . This is not just about this is not about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls . It is about connecting every part of America to the digital age . It is about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world . It is about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device a student who can take classes with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chats with her doctor . All these investments in innovation , education , and infrastructure will make America a better place to do business and create jobs . But to help our companies compete , we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success . For example , over the years , a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries . Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all . But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world . It makes no sense , and it has to change . So tonight , I am asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system . Get rid of the loopholes . Level the playing field . And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit . It can be done . To help businesses sell more products abroad , we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 because the more we export , the more jobs we create here at home . Already , our exports are up . Recently , we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250 , 000 jobs here in the United States . And last month , we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70 , 000 American jobs . This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor , Democrats and Republicans and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible . Now , before I took office , I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements , and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs . That is what we did with Korea , and that is what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks . To reduce barriers to growth and investment , I have ordered a review of government regulations . When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses , we will fix them . But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common sense safeguards to protect the American people . That is what we have done in this country for more than a century . It is why our food is safe to eat , our water is safe to drink , and our air is safe to breathe . It is why we have speed limits and child labor laws . It is why last year , we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis . And it is why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients . Now , I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law . So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved . If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable , I am eager to work with you . We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses . What I am not willing to do what I am not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition . I am not willing to tell James Howard , a brain cancer patient from Texas , that his treatment might not be covered . I am not willing to tell Jim Houser , a small business man from Oregon , that he has to go back to paying 5 , 000 more to cover his employees . As we speak , this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients parents coverage . So I say to this chamber tonight , instead of re fighting the battles of the last two years , let us fix what needs fixing and let us move forward . Now , the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we are not buried under a mountain of debt . We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago . And in the wake of the financial crisis , some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing , save jobs , and put money in people s pockets . But now that the worst of the recession is over , we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in . That is not sustainable . Every day , families sacrifice to live within their means . They deserve a government that does the same . So tonight , I am proposing that starting this year , we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years . Now , this would reduce the deficit by more than 400 billion over the next decade , and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President . This freeze will require painful cuts . Already , we have frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years . I have proposed cuts to things I care deeply about , like community action programs . The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without . I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts , and I am willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without . But let us make sure that we are not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens . And let us make sure that what we are cutting is really excess weight . Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine . It may make you feel like you are flying high at first , but it will not take long before you feel the impact . Now , most of the cuts and savings I have proposed only address annual domestic spending , which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget . To make further progress , we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough . It will not . The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear . I do not agree with all their proposals , but they made important progress . And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it in domestic spending , defense spending , health care spending , and spending through tax breaks and loopholes . This means further reducing health care costs , including programs like Medicare and Medicaid , which are the single biggest contributor to our long term deficit . The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs , which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit . Still , I am willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs , including one that Republicans suggested last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits . To put us on solid ground , we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations . We must do it without putting at risk current retirees , the most vulnerable , or people with disabilities without slashing benefits for future generations and without subjecting Americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market . And if we truly care about our deficit , we simply cannot afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students , we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break . It is not a matter of punishing their success . It is about promoting America s success . In fact , the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code . This will be a tough job , but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this , and I am prepared to join them . So now is the time to act . Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress Democrats and Republicans to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done . If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits , we can make the investments we need to win the future . Let me take this one step further . We should not just give our people a government that is more affordable . We should give them a government that is more competent and more efficient . We cannot win the future with a government of the past . We live and do business in the Information Age , but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white TThere are 12 different agencies that deal with exports . There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy . Then there is my favorite example The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they are in fresh water , but the Commerce Department handles them when they are in saltwater . I hear it gets even more complicated once they are smoked . Now , we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste . Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse . We are selling acres of federal office space that has not been used in years , and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more . But we need to think bigger . In the coming months , my administration will develop a proposal to merge , consolidate , and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America . I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote and we will push to get it passed . In the coming year , we will also work to rebuild people s faith in the institution of government . Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent , you will be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history . Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists , I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done put that information online . And because the American people deserve to know that special interests are not larding up legislation with pet projects , both parties in Congress should know this If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside , I will veto it . I will veto it . The 21st century government that is open and competent . A government that lives within its means . An economy that is driven by new skills and new ideas . Our success in this new and changing world will require reform , responsibility , and innovation . It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs . Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders , so can new threats and new challenges . No single wall separates East and West . No one rival superpower is aligned against us . And so we must defeat determined enemies , wherever they are , and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion . And America s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity . And because we have begun this work , tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America s standing has been restored . Look to Iraq , where nearly 100 , 000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high . American combat patrols have ended , violence is down , and a new government has been formed . This year , our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people , while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq . America s commitment has been kept . The Iraq war is coming to an end . Of course , as we speak , al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us . Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals , we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies . And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders , we are responding with the strength of our communities , with respect for the rule of law , and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family . We have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad . In Afghanistan , our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces . Our purpose is clear By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people , we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9 11 . Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians , fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency . There will be tough fighting ahead , and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance . But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them . This year , we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead . And this July , we will begin to bring our troops home . In Pakistan , al Qaeda s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001 . Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield . Their safe havens are shrinking . And we have sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe We will not relent , we will not waver , and we will defeat you . American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war . Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty , far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed . Because we rallied the world , nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists . Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations , the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions , tighter sanctions than ever before . And on the Korean Peninsula , we stand with our ally South Korea , and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons . This is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity . With our European allies , we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense . We have reset our relationship with Russia , strengthened Asian alliances , built new partnerships with nations like India . This March , I will travel to Brazil , Chile , and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas . Around the globe , we are standing with those who take responsibility helping farmers grow more food , supporting doctors who care for the sick , and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity . Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power it must also be the purpose behind it . In south Sudan with our assistance the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war . Thousands lined up before dawn . People danced in the streets . One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him This was a battlefield for most of my life , he said . Now we want to be free . And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia , where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator . And tonight , let us be clear The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia , and supports the democratic aspirations of all people . We must never forget that the things we have struggled for , and fought for , live in the hearts of people everywhere . And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country . Tonight , let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families . Let us serve them as well as they have served us by giving them the equipment they need , by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned , and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation . Our troops come from every corner of this country they are black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American . They are Christian and Hindu , Jewish and Muslim . And , yes , we know that some of them are gay . Starting this year , no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love . And with that change , I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTIt is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past . It is time to move forward as one nation . We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us . Reforming our schools , changing the way we use energy , reducing our deficit none of this will be easy . All of it will take time . And it will be harder because we will argue about everything . The costs . The details . The letter of every law . Of course , some countries do not have this problem . If the central government wants a railroad , they build a railroad , no matter how many homes get bulldozed . If they do not want a bad story in the newspaper , it does not get written . And yet , as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be , I know there is not a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth . We may have differences in policy , but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution . We may have different opinions , but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try . We may have different backgrounds , but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible . No matter who you are . No matter where you come from . That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight . That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me . That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth . That dream that American Dream is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era . It is what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future . And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher . Brandon started a company in Berlin , Pennsylvania , that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology . And one day last summer , he saw the news that halfway across the world , 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine , and no one knew how to save them . But Brandon thought his company could help . And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment . And Brandon left for Chile . Along with others , he began drilling a 2 , 000 foot hole into the ground , working three or four hour three or four days at a time without any sleep . Thirty seven days later , Plan B succeeded , and the miners were rescued . But because he did not want all of the attention , Brandon was not there when the miners emerged . He had already gone back home , back to work on his next project . And later , one of his employees said of the rescue , We proved that Center Rock is a little company , but we do big things . We do big things . From the earliest days of our founding , America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream . That is how we win the future . We are a nation that says , I might not have a lot of money , but I have this great idea for a new company . I might not come from a family of college graduates , but I will be the first to get my degree . I might not know those people in trouble , but I think I can help them , and I need to try . I am not sure how we will reach that better place beyond the horizon , but I know we will get there . I know we will . We do big things . The idea of America endures . Our destiny remains our choice . And tonight , more than two centuries later , it is because of our people that our future is hopeful , our journey goes forward , and the state of our union is strong . Thank you . God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .Good afternoon , everybody . As a candidate for President , I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world . After taking office , I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011 . As Commander in Chief , ensuring the success of this strategy has been one of my highest national security priorities . Last year , I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq . And to date , we have removed more than 100 , 000 troops . Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country s security . A few hours ago I spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki . I reaffirmed that the United States keeps its commitments . He spoke of the determination of the Iraqi people to forge their own future . We are in full agreement about how to move forward . So today , I can report that , as promised , the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year . After nearly nine years , America s war in Iraq will be over . Over the next two months , our troops in Iraq tens of thousands of them will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their heads held high , proud of their success , and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops . That is how America s military efforts in Iraq will end . But even as we mark this important milestone , we are also moving into a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Iraq . As of January 1st , and in keeping with our Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq , it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations , an equal partnership based on mutual interests and mutual respect . In today s conversation , Prime Minister Maliki and I agreed that a meeting of the Higher Coordinating Committee of the Strategic Framework Agreement will convene in the coming weeks . And I invited the Prime Minister to come to the White House in December , as we plan for all the important work that we have to do together . This will be a strong and enduring partnership . With our diplomats and civilian advisors in the lead , we will help Iraqis strengthen institutions that are just , representative and accountable . We will build new ties of trade and of commerce , culture and education , that unleash the potential of the Iraqi people . We will partner with an Iraq that contributes to regional security and peace , just as we insist that other nations respect Iraq s sovereignty . As I told Prime Minister Maliki , we will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces again , just as we offer training and assistance to countries around the world . After all , there will be some difficult days ahead for Iraq , and the United States will continue to have an interest in an Iraq that is stable , secure and self reliant . Just as Iraqis have persevered through war , I am confident that they can build a future worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization . Here at home , the coming months will be another season of homecomings . Across America , our servicemen and women will be reunited with their families . Today , I can say that our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays . This December will be a time to reflect on all that we have been though in this war . I will join the American people in paying tribute to the more than 1 million Americans who have served in Iraq . We will honor our many wounded warriors and the nearly 4 , 500 American patriots and their Iraqi and coalition partners who gave their lives to this effort . And finally , I would note that the end of war in Iraq reflects a larger transition . The tide of war is receding . The drawdown in Iraq allowed us to refocus our fight against al Qaeda and achieve major victories against its leadership including Osama bin Laden . Now , even as we remove our last troops from Iraq , we are beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan , where we have begun a transition to Afghan security and leadership . When I took office , roughly 180 , 000 troops were deployed in both these wars . And by the end of this year that number will be cut in half , and make no mistake It will continue to go down . Meanwhile , yesterday marked the definitive end of the Qaddafi regime in Libya . And there , too , our military played a critical role in shaping a situation on the ground in which the Libyan people can build their own future . Today , NATO is working to bring this successful mission to a close . So to sum up , the United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year . The transition in Afghanistan is moving forward , and our troops are finally coming home . As they do , fewer deployments and more time training will help keep our military the very best in the world . And as we welcome home our newest veterans , we will never stop working to give them and their families the care , the benefits and the opportunities that they have earned . This includes enlisting our veterans in the greatest challenge that we now face as a nation creating opportunity and jobs in this country . Because after a decade of war , the nation that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own an America that sees its economic strength restored just as we have restored our leadership around the globe . Thank you very much .Thank you very much . Thank you . My Lord Chancellor , Mr . Speaker , Mr . Prime Minister , my lords , and members of the House of Commons I have known few greater honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster Hall . I am told that the last three speakers here have been the Pope , Her Majesty the Queen , and Nelson Mandela which is either a very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke . I come here today to reaffirm one of the oldest , one of the strongest alliances the world has ever known . It is long been said that the United States and the United Kingdom share a special relationship . And since we also share an especially active press corps , that relationship is often analyzed and overanalyzed for the slightest hint of stress or strain . Of course , all relationships have their ups and downs . Admittedly , ours got off on the wrong foot with a small scrape about tea and taxes . There may also have been some hurt feelings when the White House was set on fire during the War of 1812 . But fortunately , it is been smooth sailing ever since . The reason for this close friendship does not just have to do with our shared history , our shared heritage our ties of language and culture or even the strong partnership between our governments . Our relationship is special because of the values and beliefs that have united our people through the ages . Centuries ago , when kings , emperors , and warlords reigned over much of the world , it was the English who first spelled out the rights and liberties of man in the Magna Carta . It was here , in this very hall , where the rule of law first developed , courts were established , disputes were settled , and citizens came to petition their leaders . Over time , the people of this nation waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and secure their freedom from the crown . Propelled by the ideals of the Enlightenment , they would ultimately forge an English Bill of Rights , and invest the power to govern in an elected parliament that is gathered here today . What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world . But perhaps no one drew greater inspiration from these notions of freedom than your rabble rousing colonists on the other side of the Atlantic . As Winston Churchill said , the hellip Magna Carta , the Bill of Rights , Habeas Corpus , trial by jury , and English common law find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence . For both of our nations , living up to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has sometimes been difficult , has always been a work in progress . The path has never been perfect . But through the struggles of slaves and immigrants , women and ethnic minorities , former colonies and persecuted religions , we have learned better than most that the longing for freedom and human dignity is not English or American or Western it is universal , and it beats in every heart . Perhaps that is why there are few nations that stand firmer , speak louder , and fight harder to defend democratic values around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom . We are the allies who landed at Omaha and Gold , who sacrificed side by side to free a continent from the march of tyranny , and help prosperity flourish from the ruins of war . And with the founding of NATO a British idea we joined a transatlantic alliance that has ensured our security for over half a century . Together with our allies , we forged a lasting peace from a cold war . When the Iron Curtain lifted , we expanded our alliance to include the nations of Central and Eastern Europe , and built new bridges to Russia and the former states of the Soviet Union . And when there was strife in the Balkans , we worked together to keep the peace . Today , after a difficult decade that began with war and ended in recession , our nations have arrived at a pivotal moment once more . A global economy that once stood on the brink of depression is now stable and recovering . After years of conflict , the United States has removed 100 , 000 troops from Iraq , the United Kingdom has removed its forces , and our combat mission there has ended . In Afghanistan , we have broken the Taliban s momentum and will soon begin a transition to Afghan lead . And nearly 10 years after 9 11 , we have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader Osama bin Laden . Together , we have met great challenges . But as we enter this new chapter in our shared history , profound challenges stretch before us . In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked , a new era of cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy . As new threats spread across borders and oceans , we must dismantle terrorist networks and stop the spread of nuclear weapons , confront climate change and combat famine and disease . And as a revolution races through the streets of the Middle East and North Africa , the entire world has a stake in the aspirations of a generation that longs to determine its own destiny . These challenges come at a time when the international order has already been reshaped for a new century . Countries like China , India , and Brazil are growing by leaps and bounds . We should welcome this development , for it has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty around the globe , and created new markets and opportunities for our own nations . And yet , as this rapid change has taken place , it is become fashionable in some quarters to question whether the rise of these nations will accompany the decline of American and European influence around the world . Perhaps , the argument goes , these nations represent the future , and the time for our leadership has passed . That argument is wrong . The time for our leadership is now . It was the United States and the United Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped a world in which new nations could emerge and individuals could thrive . And even as more nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership , our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more peaceful , more prosperous and more just . At a time when threats and challenges require nations to work in concert with one another , we remain the greatest catalysts for global action . In an era defined by the rapid flow of commerce and information , it is our free market tradition , our openness , fortified by our commitment to basic security for our citizens , that offers the best chance of prosperity that is both strong and shared . As millions are still denied their basic human rights because of who they are , or what they believe , or the kind of government that they live under , we are the nations most willing to stand up for the values of tolerance and self determination that lead to peace and dignity . Now , this does not mean we can afford to stand still . The nature of our leadership will need to change with the times . As I said the first time I came to London as President , for the G20 summit , the days are gone when Roosevelt and Churchill could sit in a room and solve the world s problems over a glass of brandy although I am sure that Prime Minister Cameron would agree that some days we could both use a stiff drink . In this century , our joint leadership will require building new partnerships , adapting to new circumstances , and remaking ourselves to meet the demands of a new era . That begins with our economic leadership . Adam Smith s central insight remains true today There is no greater generator of wealth and innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes the full potential of individual men and women . That is what led to the Industrial Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester . That is what led to the dawn of the Information Age that arose from the office parks of Silicon Valley . That is why countries like China , India and Brazil are growing so rapidly because in fits and starts , they are moving toward market based principles that the United States and the United Kingdom have always embraced . In other words , we live in a global economy that is largely of our own making . And today , the competition for the best jobs and industries favors countries that are free thinking and forward looking countries with the most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizens . That gives nations like the United States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage . For from Newton and Darwin to Edison and Einstein , from Alan Turing to Steve Jobs , we have led the world in our commitment to science and cutting edge research , the discovery of new medicines and technologies . We educate our citizens and train our workers in the best colleges and universities on Earth . But to maintain this advantage in a world that is more competitive than ever , we will have to redouble our investments in science and engineering , and renew our national commitments to educating our workforces . We have also been reminded in the last few years that markets can sometimes fail . In the last century , both our nations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with such market failures safeguards to protect the banking system after the Great Depression , for example regulations that were established to prevent the pollution of our air and water during the 1970s . But in today s economy , such threats of market failure can no longer be contained within the borders of any one country . Market failures can go global , and go viral , and demand international responses . A financial crisis that began on Wall Street infected nearly every continent , which is why we must keep working through forums like the G20 to put in place global rules of the road to prevent future excesses and abuse . No country can hide from the dangers of carbon pollution , which is why we must build on what was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave our children a planet that is safer and cleaner . Moreover , even when the free market works as it should , both our countries recognize that no matter how responsibly we live in our lives , hard times or bad luck , a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of us . And so part of our common tradition has expressed itself in a conviction that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security health care if you get sick , unemployment insurance if you lose your job , a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work . That commitment to our citizens has also been the reason for our leadership in the world . And now , having come through a terrible recession , our challenge is to meet these obligations while ensuring that we are not consuming and hence consumed with a level of debt that could sap the strength and vitality of our economies . And that will require difficult choices and it will require different paths for both of our countries . But we have faced such challenges before , and have always been able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the responsibilities we have to one another . And I believe we can do this again . As we do , the successes and failures of our own past can serve as an example for emerging economies that it is possible to grow without polluting that lasting prosperity comes not from what a nation consumes , but from what it produces , and from the investments it makes in its people and its infrastructure . And just as we must lead on behalf of the prosperity of our citizens , so we must safeguard their security . Our two nations know what it is to confront evil in the world . Hitler s armies would not have stopped their killing had we not fought them on the beaches and on the landing grounds , in the fields and on the streets . We must never forget that there was nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war . It was won through the courage and character of our people . Precisely because we are willing to bear its burden , we know well the cost of war . And that is why we built an alliance that was strong enough to defend this continent while deterring our enemies . At its core , NATO is rooted in the simple concept of Article Five that no NATO nation will have to fend on its own that allies will stand by one another , always . And for six decades , NATO has been the most successful alliance in human history . Today , we confront a different enemy . Terrorists have taken the lives of our citizens in New York and in London . And while al Qaeda seeks a religious war with the West , we must remember that they have killed thousands of Muslims men , women and children around the globe . Our nations are not and will never be at war with Islam . Our fight is focused on defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies . In that effort , we will not relent , as Osama bin Laden and his followers have learned . And as we fight an enemy that respects no law of war , we will continue to hold ourselves to a higher standard by living up to the values , the rule of law and due process that we so ardently defend . For almost a decade , Afghanistan has been a central front of these efforts . Throughout those years , you , the British people , have been a stalwart ally , along with so many others who fight by our side . Together , let us pay tribute to all of our men and women who have served and sacrificed over the last several years for they are part of an unbroken line of heroes who have borne the heaviest burden for the freedoms that we enjoy . Because of them , we have broken the Taliban s momentum . Because of them , we have built the capacity of Afghan security forces . And because of them , we are now preparing to turn a corner in Afghanistan by transitioning to Afghan lead . And during this transition , we will pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of al Qaeda and respect the Afghan constitution and lay down arms . And we will ensure that Afghanistan is never a safe haven for terror , but is instead a country that is strong , sovereign , and able to stand on its own two feet . Indeed , our efforts in this young century have led us to a new concept for NATO that will give us the capabilities needed to meet new threats threats like terrorism and piracy , cyber attacks and ballistic missiles . But a revitalized NATO will continue to hew to that original vision of its founders , allowing us to rally collective action for the defense of our people , while building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt and Churchill that all nations have both rights and responsibilities , and all nations share a common interest in an international architecture that maintains the peace . We also share a common interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons . Across the globe , nations are locking down nuclear materials so they never fall into the wrong hands because of our leadership . From North Korea to Iran , we have sent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will face consequences which is why America and the European Union just recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran , in large part because of the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States . And while we hold others to account , we will meet our own obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty , and strive for a world without nuclear weapons . We share a common interest in resolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear whole regions asunder . In Sudan , after years of war and thousands of deaths , we call on both North and South to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace . And in the Middle East , we stand united in our support for a secure Israel and a sovereign Palestine . And we share a common interest in development that advances dignity and security . To succeed , we must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of the globe as a place for charity . Instead , we should empower the same forces that have allowed our own people to thrive We should help the hungry to feed themselves , the doctors who care for the sick . We should support countries that confront corruption , and allow their people to innovate . And we should advance the truth that nations prosper when they allow women and girls to reach their full potential . We do these things because we believe not simply in the rights of nations we believe in the rights of citizens . That is the beacon that guided us through our fight against fascism and our twilight struggle against communism . And today , that idea is being put to the test in the Middle East and North Africa . In country after country , people are mobilizing to free themselves from the grip of an iron fist . And while these movements for change are just six months old , we have seen them play out before from Eastern Europe to the Americas , from South Africa to Southeast Asia . History tells us that democracy is not easy . It will be years before these revolutions reach their conclusion , and there will be difficult days along the way . Power rarely gives up without a fight particularly in places where there are divisions of tribe and divisions of sect . We also know that populism can take dangerous turns from the extremism of those who would use democracy to deny minority rights , to the nationalism that left so many scars on this continent in the 20th century . But make no mistake What we saw , what we are seeing in Tehran , in Tunis , in Tahrir Square , is a longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted here at home . It was a rejection of the notion that people in certain parts of the world do not want to be free , or need to have democracy imposed upon them . It was a rebuke to the worldview of al Qaeda , which smothers the rights of individuals , and would thereby subject them to perpetual poverty and violence . Let there be no doubt The United States and United Kingdom stand squarely on the side of those who long to be free . And now , we must show that we will back up those words with deeds . That means investing in the future of those nations that transition to democracy , starting with Tunisia and Egypt by deepening ties of trade and commerce by helping them demonstrate that freedom brings prosperity . And that means standing up for universal rights by sanctioning those who pursue repression , strengthening civil society , supporting the rights of minorities . We do this knowing that the West must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the Middle East and North Africa a mistrust that is rooted in a difficult past . For years , we have faced charges of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedoms that they hear us espouse . And so to them , we must squarely acknowledge that , yes , we have enduring interests in the region to fight terror , sometimes with partners who may not be perfect to protect against disruptions of the world s energy supply . But we must also insist that we reject as false the choice between our interests and our ideals between stability and democracy . For our idealism is rooted in the realities of history that repression offers only the false promise of stability , that societies are more successful when their citizens are free , and that democracies are the closest allies we have . It is that truth that guides our action in Libya . It would have been easy at the outset of the crackdown in Libya to say that none of this was our business that a nation s sovereignty is more important than the slaughter of civilians within its borders . That argument carries weight with some . But we are different . We embrace a broader responsibility . And while we cannot stop every injustice , there are circumstances that cut through our caution when a leader is threatening to massacre his people , and the international community is calling for action . That is why we stopped a massacre in Libya . And we will not relent until the people of Libya are protected and the shadow of tyranny is lifted . We will proceed with humility , and the knowledge that we cannot dictate every outcome abroad . Ultimately , freedom must be won by the people themselves , not imposed from without . But we can and must stand with those who so struggle . Because we have always believed that the future of our children and grandchildren will be better if other people s children and grandchildren are more prosperous and more free from the beaches of Normandy to the Balkans to Benghazi . That is our interests and our ideals . And if we fail to meet that responsibility , who would take our place , and what kind of world would we pass on Our action our leadership is essential to the cause of human dignity . And so we must act and lead with confidence in our ideals , and an abiding faith in the character of our people , who sent us all here today . For there is one final quality that I believe makes the United States and the United Kingdom indispensable to this moment in history . And that is how we define ourselves as nations . Unlike most countries in the world , we do not define citizenship based on race or ethnicity . Being American or British is not about belonging to a certain group it is about believing in a certain set of ideals the rights of individuals , the rule of law . That is why we hold incredible diversity within our borders . That is why there are people around the world right now who believe that if they come to America , if they come to New York , if they come to London , if they work hard , they can pledge allegiance to our flag and call themselves Americans if they come to England , they can make a new life for themselves and can sing God Save The Queen just like any other citizen . Yes , our diversity can lead to tension . And throughout our history there have been heated debates about immigration and assimilation in both of our countries . But even as these debates can be difficult , we fundamentally recognize that our patchwork heritage is an enormous strength that in a world which will only grow smaller and more interconnected , the example of our two nations says it is possible for people to be united by their ideals , instead of divided by their differences that it is possible for hearts to change and old hatreds to pass that it is possible for the sons and daughters of former colonies to sit here as members of this great Parliament , and for the grandson of a Kenyan who served as a cook in the British Army to stand before you as President of the United States . That is what defines us . That is why the young men and women in the streets of Damascus and Cairo still reach for the rights our citizens enjoy , even if they sometimes differ with our policies . As two of the most powerful nations in the history of the world , we must always remember that the true source of our influence has not just been the size of our economies , or the reach of our militaries , or the land that we have claimed . It has been the values that we must never waver in defending around the world the idea that all beings are endowed by our Creator with certain rights that cannot be denied . That is what forged our bond in the fire of war a bond made manifest by the friendship between two of our greatest leaders . Churchill and Roosevelt had their differences . They were keen observers of each other s blind spots and shortcomings , if not always their own , and they were hard headed about their ability to remake the world . But what joined the fates of these two men at that particular moment in history was not simply a shared interest in victory on the battlefield . It was a shared belief in the ultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity a conviction that we have a say in how this story ends . This conviction lives on in their people today . The challenges we face are great . The work before us is hard . But we have come through a difficult decade , and whenever the tests and trials ahead may seem too big or too many , let us turn to their example , and the words that Churchill spoke on the day that Europe was freed In the long years to come , not only will the people of this island but hellip the world , wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human heart , look back to what we have done , and they will say do not despair , do not yield hellip march straightforward . With courage and purpose , with humility and with hope , with faith in the promise of tomorrow , let us march straightforward together , enduring allies in the cause of a world that is more peaceful , more prosperous , and more just . Thank you very much .Thank you . Thank you , Governor . To all the families , first responders , to the community of Newtown , clergy , guests Scripture tells us hellip do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away hellip inwardly we are being renewed day by day . For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all . So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal . For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , an eternal house in heaven , not built by human hands . We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults . They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America . Here in Newtown , I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation . I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow , nor can they heal your wounded hearts . I can only hope it helps for you to know that you are not alone in your grief that our world too has been torn apart that all across this land of ours , we have wept with you , we have pulled our children tight . And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide , we will provide whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load , we will gladly bear it . Newtown you are not alone . As these difficult days have unfolded , you have also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice . We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary , the school s staff did not flinch , they did not hesitate . Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach , Vicki Soto , Lauren Rousseau , Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances with courage and with love , giving their lives to protect the children in their care . We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms , and kept steady through it all , and reassured their students by saying wait for the good guys , they are coming show me your smile . And we know that good guys came . The first responders who raced to the scene , helping to guide those in harm s way to safety , and comfort those in need , holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do , and others needed them more . And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren , helping one another , holding each other , dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do one child even trying to encourage a grown up by saying , I know karate . So it is okay . I will lead the way out . As a community , you have inspired us , Newtown . In the face of indescribable violence , in the face of unconscionable evil , you have looked out for each other , and you have cared for one another , and you have loved one another . This is how Newtown will be remembered . And with time , and God s grace , that love will see you through . But we , as a nation , we are left with some hard questions . Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time , walking around . With their very first cry , this most precious , vital part of ourselves our child is suddenly exposed to the world , to possible mishap or malice . And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm . And yet , we also know that with that child s very first step , and each step after that , they are separating from us that we will not that we cannot always be there for them . They will suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments . And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self reliant and capable and resilient , ready to face the world without fear . And we know we cannot do this by ourselves . It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize , no matter how much you love these kids , you cannot do it by yourself . That this job of keeping our children safe , and teaching them well , is something we can only do together , with the help of friends and neighbors , the help of a community , and the help of a nation . And in that way , we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we are counting on everybody else to help look after ours that we are all parents that they are all our children . This is our first task caring for our children . It is our first job . If we do not get that right , we do not get anything right . That is how , as a society , we will be judged . And by that measure , can we truly say , as a nation , that we are meeting our obligations Can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our children all of them safe from harm Can we claim , as a nation , that we are all together there , letting them know that they are loved , and teaching them to love in return Can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose I have been reflecting on this the last few days , and if we are honest with ourselves , the answer is no . We are not doing enough . And we will have to change . Since I have been President , this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting . The fourth time we have hugged survivors . The fourth time we have consoled the families of victims . And in between , there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country , almost daily reports of victims , many of them children , in small towns and big cities all across America victims whose much of the time , their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time . We cannot tolerate this anymore . These tragedies must end . And to end them , we must change . We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex , and that is true . No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world , or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society . But that cannot be an excuse for inaction . Surely , we can do better than this . If there is even one step we can take to save another child , or another parent , or another town , from the grief that has visited Tucson , and Aurora , and Oak Creek , and Newtown , and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that then surely we have an obligation to try . In the coming weeks , I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . Because what choice do we have We cannot accept events like this as routine . Are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom All the world s religions so many of them represented here today start with a simple question Why are we here What gives our life meaning What gives our acts purpose We know our time on this Earth is fleeting . We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain that even after we chase after some earthly goal , whether it is wealth or power or fame , or just simple comfort , we will , in some fashion , fall short of what we had hoped . We know that no matter how good our intentions , we will all stumble sometimes , in some way . We will make mistakes , we will experience hardships . And even when we are trying to do the right thing , we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness , so often unable to discern God s heavenly plans . There is only one thing we can be sure of , and that is the love that we have for our children , for our families , for each other . The warmth of a small child s embrace that is true . The memories we have of them , the joy that they bring , the wonder we see through their eyes , that fierce and boundless love we feel for them , a love that takes us out of ourselves , and binds us to something larger we know that is what matters . We know we are always doing right when we are taking care of them , when we are teaching them well , when we are showing acts of kindness . We do not go wrong when we do that . That is what we can be sure of . And that is what you , the people of Newtown , have reminded us . That is how you have inspired us . You remind us what matters . And that is what should drive us forward in everything we do , for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth . Let the little children come to me , Jesus said , and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven . Charlotte . Daniel . Olivia . Josephine . Ana . Dylan . Madeleine . Catherine . Chase . Jesse . James . Grace . Emilie . Jack . Noah . Caroline . Jessica . Benjamin . Avielle . Allison . God has called them all home . For those of us who remain , let us find the strength to carry on , and make our country worthy of their memory . May God bless and keep those we have lost in His heavenly place . May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort . And may He bless and watch over this community , and the United States of America .Tonight , more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny , the task of perfecting our union moves forward . It moves forward because of you . It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams , we are an American family , and we rise or fall together , as one nation , and as one people . Tonight , in this election , you , the American people , reminded us that while our road has been hard , while our journey has been long , we have picked ourselves up , we have fought our way back , and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America , the best is yet to come . I want to thank every American who participated in this election . Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time by the way , we have to fix that . Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign , you made your voice heard , and you made a difference . I just spoke with Governor Romney , and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign . We may have battled fiercely , but it is only because we love this country deeply , and we care so strongly about its future . From George to Lenore to their son Mitt , the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service , and that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight . In the weeks ahead , I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward . I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years , America s happy warrior the best Vice President anybody could ever hope for Joe Biden . And I would not be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago . Let me say this publicly Michelle , I have never loved you more . I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you , too , as our nation s First Lady . Sasha and Malia , before our very eyes , you are growing up to become two strong , smart , beautiful young women , just like your mom . And I am so proud of you guys . But I will say that for now , one dog is probably enough . To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics the best . The best ever . Some of you were new this time around , and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning . But all of you are family . No matter what you do or where you go from here , you will carry the memory of the history we made together , and you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful President . Thank you for believing all the way , through every hill , through every valley . You lifted me up the whole way . And I will always be grateful for everything that you have done and all the incredible work that you put in . I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small , even silly . And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos , or the domain of special interests . But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies , and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym , or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home , you will discover something else . You will hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who is worked his way through college , and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity . You will hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who is going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift . You will hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who is working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job , or a roof over their head when they come home . That is why we do this . That is what politics can be . That is why elections matter . It is not small it is big . It is important . Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated . We have our own opinions . Each of us has deeply held beliefs . And when we go through tough times , when we make big decisions as a country , it necessarily stirs passions , stirs up controversy . That will not change after tonight and it should not . These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty , and we can never forget that as we speak , people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter , the chance to cast their ballots like we did today . But despite all our differences , most of us share certain hopes for America s future . We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation , with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow . We want our children to live in an America that is not burdened by debt that is not weakened by inequality that is not threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet . We want to pass on a country that is safe and respected and admired around the world a nation that is defended by the strongest military on Earth and the best troops this world has ever known but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being . We believe in a generous America in a compassionate America in a tolerant America , open to the dreams of an immigrant s daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag . To the young boy on the South Side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner . To the furniture worker s child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist , an engineer or entrepreneur , a diplomat or even a President . That is the future we hope for . That is the vision we share . That is where we need to go . Forward . That is where we need to go . Now , we will disagree , sometimes fiercely , about how to get there . As it has for more than two centuries , progress will come in fits and starts . It is not always a straight line . It is not always a smooth path . By itself , the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams will not end all the gridlock , or solve all our problems , or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus , and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward . But that common bond is where we must begin . Our economy is recovering . A decade of war is ending . A long campaign is now over . And whether I earned your vote or not , I have listened to you . I have learned from you . And you have made me a better President . With your stories and your struggles , I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do , and the future that lies ahead . Tonight , you voted for action , not politics as usual . You elected us to focus on your jobs , not ours . And in the coming weeks and months , I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together reducing our deficit reforming our tax code fixing our immigration system freeing ourselves from foreign oil . We have got more work to do . But that does not mean your work is done . The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with your vote . America has never been about what can be done for us . It is about what can be done by us , together , through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government . That is the principle we were founded on . This country has more wealth than any nation , but that is not what makes us rich . We have the most powerful military in history , but that is not what makes us strong . Our university , culture are the envy of the world , but that is not what keeps the world coming to our shores . What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth the belief that our destiny is shared that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another , and to future generations that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights , and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism . That is what makes America great . I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America . I have seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors , and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job . I have seen it in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb , and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them , watching their back . I have seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York , where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm . And I saw it just the other day in Mentor , Ohio , where a father told the story of his eight year old daughter , whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything , had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care . I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father , but meet this incredible daughter of his . And when he spoke to the crowd , listening to that father s story , every parent in that room had tears in their eyes , because we knew that little girl could be our own . And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright . That is who we are . That is the country I am so proud to lead as your President . And tonight , despite all the hardship we have been through , despite all the frustrations of Washington , I have never been more hopeful about our future . I have never been more hopeful about America . And I ask you to sustain that hope . I am not talking about blind optimism the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path . I am not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight . I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists , despite all the evidence to the contrary , that something better awaits us , so long as we have the courage to keep reaching , to keep working , to keep fighting . America , I believe we can build on the progress we have made , and continue to fight for new jobs , and new opportunity , and new security for the middle class . I believe we can keep the promise of our founding the idea that if you are willing to work hard , it does not matter who you are , or where you come from , or what you look like , or where you love it does not matter whether you are black or white , or Hispanic or Asian , or Native American , or young or old , or rich or poor , abled , disabled , gay or straight you can make it here in America if you are willing to try . I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggest we are not as cynical as the pundits believe we are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states . We are , and forever will be , the United States of America . And together , with your help , and God s grace , we will continue our journey forward , and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth . Thank you , America . God bless you . God bless these United States .Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , members of Congress , fellow citizens Fifty one years ago , John Kennedy declared to this chamber that the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress . It is my task , he said , to report the State of the Union to improve it is the task of us all . Tonight , thanks to the grit and determination of the American people , there is much progress to report . After a decade of grinding war , our brave men and women in uniform are coming home . After years of grueling recession , our businesses have created over six million new jobs . We buy more American cars than we have in five years , and less foreign oil than we have in 20 . Our housing market is healing , our stock market is rebounding , and consumers , patients , and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before . So , together , we have cleared away the rubble of crisis , and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger . But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded . Our economy is adding jobs but too many people still cannot find full time employment . Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all time highs but for more than a decade , wages and incomes have barely budged . It is our generation s task , then , to reignite the true engine of America s economic growth a rising , thriving middle class . It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities , you can get ahead , no matter where you come from , no matter what you look like , or who you love . It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many , and not just the few that it encourages free enterprise , rewards individual initiative , and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation . The American people do not expect government to solve every problem . They do not expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue . But they do expect us to put the nation s interests before party . They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can . For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together , and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all . Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery . Over the last few years , both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than 2 . 5 trillion mostly through spending cuts , but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans . As a result , we are more than halfway towards the goal of 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances . Now we need to finish the job . And the question is , how In 2011 , Congress passed a law saying that if both parties could not agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal , about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year . These sudden , harsh , arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness . They had devastate priorities like education , and energy , and medical research . They would certainly slow our recovery , and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs . That is why Democrats , Republicans , business leaders , and economists have already said that these cuts , known here in Washington as the sequester , are a really bad idea . Now , some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training , Medicare and Social Security benefits . That idea is even worse . Yes , the biggest driver of our long term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population . And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms otherwise , our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children , and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations . But we cannot ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful . We will not grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling , or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters . Most Americans Democrats , Republicans , and independents understand that we cannot just cut our way to prosperity . They know that broad based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction , with spending cuts and revenue , and with everybody doing their fair share . And that is the approach I offer tonight . On Medicare , I am prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson Bowles commission . Already , the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs . And the reforms I am proposing go even further . We will reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors . We will bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare , because our medical bills should not be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive . And I am open to additional reforms from both parties , so long as they do not violate the guarantee of a secure retirement . Our government should not make promises we cannot keep but we must keep the promises we have already made . To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target , we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested , and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well off and the well connected . After all , why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks How is that fair Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes How does that promote growth Now is our best chance for bipartisan , comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit . We can get this done . The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms , and more time expanding and hiring a tax code that ensures billionaires with high powered accountants cannot work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas , and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America . That is what tax reform can deliver . That is what we can do together . I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy . The politics will be hard for both sides . None of us will get 100 percent of what we want . But the alternative will cost us jobs , hurt our economy , visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans . So let us set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future . And let us do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors . The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next . We cannot do it . Let us agree right here , right now to keep the people s government open , and pay our bills on time , and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America . The American people have worked too hard , for too long , rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another . Now , most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda . But let us be clear , deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan . A growing economy that creates good , middle class jobs that must be the North Star that guides our efforts . Every day , we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation How do we attract more jobs to our shores How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living A year and a half ago , I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs . And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda . I urge this Congress to pass the rest . But tonight , I will lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago . Let me repeat nothing I am proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime . It is not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad based growth . That is what we should be looking for . Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing . After shedding jobs for more than 10 years , our manufacturers have added about 500 , 000 jobs over the past three . Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan . Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico . And this year , Apple will start making Macs in America again . There are things we can do , right now , to accelerate this trend . Last year , we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown , Ohio . A once shuttered warehouse is now a state of the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything . There is no reason this cannot happen in other towns . So tonight , I am announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs , where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high tech jobs . And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America . We can get that done . Now , if we want to make the best products , we also have to invest in the best ideas . Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned 140 to our economy every dollar . Today , our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer s . They are developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful . Now is not the time to gut these job creating investments in science and innovation . Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race . We need to make those investments . Today , no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy . After years of talking about it , we are finally poised to control our own energy future . We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years . We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas , and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it . We produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone s energy bill is lower because of it . And over the last four years , our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen . But for the sake of our children and our future , we must do more to combat climate change . Now , it is true that no single event makes a trend . But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 . Heat waves , droughts , wildfires , floods all are now more frequent and more intense . We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence . Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it is too late . Now , the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth . I urge this Congress to get together , pursue a bipartisan , market based solution to climate change , like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago . But if Congress will not act soon to protect future generations , I will . I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy . Four years ago , other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it . And we have begun to change that . Last year , wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America . So let us generate even more . Solar energy gets cheaper by the year let us drive down costs even further . As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy , so must we . Now , in the meantime , the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence . We need to encourage that . And that is why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits . That is got to be part of an all of the above plan . But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water . In fact , much of our new found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we , the public , own together . So tonight , I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good . If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea , then so can we . Let us take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we have put up with for far too long . I am also issuing a new goal for America Let us cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years . We will work with the states to do it . Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen . America s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair . Ask any CEO where they had rather locate and hire a country with deteriorating roads and bridges , or one with high speed rail and Internet high tech schools , self healing power grids . The CEO of Siemens America a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina said that if we upgrade our infrastructure , they will bring even more jobs . And that is the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world . And I know you want these job creating projects in your district . I have seen all those ribbon cuttings . So tonight , I propose a Fix It First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs , like the nearly 70 , 000 structurally deficient bridges across the country . And to make sure taxpayers do not shoulder the whole burden , I am also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most modern ports to move our goods , modern pipelines to withstand a storm , modern schools worthy of our children . Let us prove that there is no better place to do business than here in the United States of America , and let us start right away . We can get this done . And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector . The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007 . Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years . Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent , and construction is expanding again . But even with mortgage rates near a 50 year low , too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected . Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no . That is holding our entire economy back . We need to fix it . Right now , there is a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save 3 , 000 a year by refinancing at today s rates . Democrats and Republicans have supported it before , so what are we waiting for Take a vote , and send me that bill . Why would we be against that Why would that be a partisan issue , helping folks refinance Right now , overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home . What is holding us back Let us streamline the process , and help our economy grow . These initiatives in manufacturing , energy , infrastructure , housing all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs . But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs . And that has to start at the earliest possible age . Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning , the better he or she does down the road . But today , fewer than 3 in 10 four year olds are enrolled in a high quality preschool program . Most middle class parents cannot afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool . And for poor kids who need help the most , this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives . So tonight , I propose working with states to make high quality preschool available to every single child in America . That is something we should be able to do . Every dollar we invest in high quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on by boosting graduation rates , reducing teen pregnancy , even reducing violent crime . In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children , like Georgia or Oklahoma , studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level , graduate high school , hold a job , form more stable families of their own . We know this works . So let us do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind . Let us give our kids that chance . Let us also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job . Right now , countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges . So those German kids , they are ready for a job when they graduate high school . They have been trained for the jobs that are there . Now at schools like P Tech in Brooklyn , a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBstudents will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate s degree in computers or engineering . We need to give every American student opportunities like this . And four years ago , we started Race to the Top a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards , all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year . Tonight , I am announcing a new challenge to redesign America s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high tech economy . And we will reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers , and create classes that focus on science , technology , engineering and math the skills today s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future . Now , even with better high schools , most young people will need some higher education . It is a simple fact the more education you have got , the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class . But today , skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education , or saddle them with unsustainable debt . Through tax credits , grants and better loans , we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years . But taxpayers cannot keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education . Colleges must do their part to keep costs down , and it is our job to make sure that they do . So tonight , I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid . And tomorrow , my administration will release a new College Scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria where you can get the most bang for your educational buck . Now , to grow our middle class , our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today s jobs require . But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who is willing to work everybody who is willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead . Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving , hopeful immigrants . And right now , leaders from the business , labor , law enforcement , faith communities they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform . Now is the time to do it . Now is the time to get it done . Now is the time to get it done . Real reform means strong border security , and we can build on the progress my administration has already made putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years . Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship a path that includes passing a background check , paying taxes and a meaningful penalty , learning English , and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally . And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy . In other words , we know what needs to be done . And as we speak , bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill , and I applaud their efforts . So let us get this done . Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months , and I will sign it right away . And America will be better for it . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . But we cannot stop there . We know our economy is stronger when our wives , our mothers , our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace , and free from the fear of domestic violence . Today , the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago . And I now urge the House to do the same . Good job , Joe . And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts , and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year . We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day s work with honest wages . But today , a full time worker making the minimum wage earns 14 , 500 a year . Even with the tax relief we put in place , a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line . That is wrong . That is why , since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage , 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher . Tonight , let us declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth , no one who works full time should have to live in poverty , and raise the federal minimum wage to 9 . 00 an hour . We should be able to get that done . This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families . It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank rent or eviction scraping by or finally getting ahead . For businesses across the country , it would mean customers with more money in their pockets . And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government . In fact , working folks should not have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher . So here s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year let us tie the minimum wage to the cost of living , so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on . Tonight , let us also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work , it is virtually impossible to get ahead . Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up . Inescapable pockets of poverty , urban and rural , where young adults are still fighting for their first job . America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny . And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them . Let us offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who have got what it takes to fill that job opening , but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore . Let us put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run down neighborhoods . And this year , my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet . We will work with local leaders to target resources at public safety , and education , and housing . We will give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest . And we will work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low income couples , and do more to encourage fatherhood because what makes you a man is not the ability to conceive a child it is having the courage to raise one . And we want to encourage that . We want to help that . Stronger families . Stronger communities . A stronger America . It is this kind of prosperity broad , shared , built on a thriving middle class that has always been the source of our progress at home . It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world . Tonight , we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us . Because of them , we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda . Already , we have brought home 33 , 000 of our brave servicemen and women . This spring , our forces will move into a support role , while Afghan security forces take the lead . Tonight , I can announce that over the next year , another 34 , 000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan . This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year , our war in Afghanistan will be over . Beyond 2014 , America s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure , but the nature of our commitment will change . We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates . Today , the organization that attacked us on 9 11 is a shadow of its former self . It is true , different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa . The threat these groups pose is evolving . But to meet this threat , we do not need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations . Instead , we will need to help countries like Yemen , and Libya , and Somalia provide for their own security , and help allies who take the fight to terrorists , as we have in Mali . And where necessary , through a range of capabilities , we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans . Now , as we do , we must enlist our values in the fight . That is why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts . Throughout , we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts . I recognize that in our democracy , no one should just take my word for it that we are doing things the right way . So in the months ahead , I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting , detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances , but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world . Of course , our challenges do not end with al Qaeda . America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world s most dangerous weapons . The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations . Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them , as we stand by our allies , strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats . Likewise , the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution , because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations , and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon . At the same time , we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals , and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations . America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks . Now , we know hackers steal people s identities and infiltrate private emails . We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets . Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid , our financial institutions , our air traffic control systems . We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy . And that is why , earlier today , I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing , and developing standards to protect our national security , our jobs , and our privacy . But now Congress must act as well , by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks . This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis . Now , even as we protect our people , we should remember that today s world presents not just dangers , not just threats , it presents opportunities . To boost American exports , support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia , we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans Pacific Partnership . And tonight , I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good paying American jobs . We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all not only because it creates new markets , more stable order in certain regions of the world , but also because it is the right thing to do . In many places , people live on little more than a dollar a day . So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy by empowering women by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve , and helping communities to feed , and power , and educate themselves by saving the world s children from preventable deaths and by realizing the promise of an AIDS free generation , which is within our reach . You see , America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change . I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon , in Burma , when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years when thousands of Burmese lined the streets , waving American flags , including a man who said , There is justice and law in the United States . I want our country to be like that . In defense of freedom , we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa from Europe to Asia . In the Middle East , we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights , and support stable transitions to democracy . We know the process will be messy , and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt , but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people . We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people , and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian . And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace . These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month . And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk our diplomats , our intelligence officers , and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces . As long as I am Commander in Chief , we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad , and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known . We will invest in new capabilities , even as we reduce waste and wartime spending . We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers , and equal benefits for their families gay and straight . We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms , because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat . We will keep faith with our veterans , investing in world class care , including mental health care , for our wounded warriors supporting our military families giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned . And I want to thank my wife , Michelle , and Dr . Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us . Thank you , honey . Thank you , Jill . Defending our freedom , though , is not just the job of our military alone . We must all do our part to make sure our God given rights are protected here at home . That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote . When any American , no matter where they live or what their party , are denied that right because they cannot afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot , we are betraying our ideals . So tonight , I am announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America . And it definitely needs improvement . I am asking two long time experts in the field who , by the way , recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney s campaign to lead it . We can fix this , and we will . The American people demand it , and so does our democracy . Of course , what I have said tonight matters little if we do not come together to protect our most precious resource our children . It has been two months since Newtown . I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence . But this time is different . Overwhelming majorities of Americans Americans who believe in the Second Amendment have come together around common sense reform , like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun . Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals . Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets , because these police chiefs , they are tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned . Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress . Now , if you want to vote no , that is your choice . But these proposals deserve a vote . Because in the two months since Newtown , more than a thousand birthdays , graduations , anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun more than a thousand . One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton . She was 15 years old . She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss . She was a majorette . She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend . Just three weeks ago , she was here , in Washington , with her classmates , performing for her country at my inauguration . And a week later , she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school , just a mile away from my house . Hadiya s parents , Nate and Cleo , are in this chamber tonight , along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence . They deserve a vote . They deserve a vote . Gabby Giffords deserves a vote . The families of Newtown deserve a vote . The families of Aurora deserve a vote . The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg , and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote . They deserve a simple vote . Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country . In fact , no laws , no initiatives , no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I have outlined tonight . But we were never sent here to be perfect . We were sent here to make what difference we can , to secure this nation , expand opportunity , uphold our ideals through the hard , often frustrating , but absolutely necessary work of self government . We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another , every single day , usually without fanfare , all across this country . We should follow their example . We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez . When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness , she was not thinking about how her own home was faring . Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe . We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor . When Desiline arrived at her polling place , she was told the wait to vote might be six hours . And as time ticked by , her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet , but whether folks like her would get to have their say . And hour after hour , a throng of people stayed in line to support her because Desiline is 102 years old . And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read , I voted . We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy . When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive , he did not consider his own safety . He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside , even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds . And when asked how he did that , Brian said , That is just the way we are made . That is just the way we are made . We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms , and hold different views than the person beside us . But as Americans , we all share the same proud title we are citizens . It is a word that does not just describe our nationality or legal status . It describes the way we are made . It describes what we believe . It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations , that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others and that well into our third century as a nation , it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these United States , to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story . Thank you . God bless you , and God bless these United States of America .Thank you . Thank you so much . Well , it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem , and I am so grateful for the welcome that I have received from the people of Israel . Thank you . I bring with me the support of the American people and the friendship that binds us together . Over the last two days , I have reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres . I have borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book , and I have seen Israel s shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs . This is a nation of museums and patents , timeless holy sites and ground breaking innovation . Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology on board the Mars Rover originated at the same time . But what I have most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you , the Israeli people especially so many young people who are here today to talk about the history that brought us here today , and the future that you will make in the years to come . Now , I know that in Israel s vibrant democracy , every word , every gesture is carefully scrutinized . But I want to clear something up just so you know any drama between me and my friend , Bibi , over the years was just a plot to create material for Eretz Nehederet . That is the only thing that was going on . We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material . I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday the celebration of Passover . And that is where I would like to begin today . Just a few days from now , Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the Seder table , and celebrate with songs , wine and symbolic foods . After enjoying Seders with family and friends in Chicago and on the campaign trail , I am proud that I have now brought this tradition into the White House . I did so because I wanted my daughters to experience the Haggadah , and the story at the center of Passover that makes this time of year so powerful . It is a story of centuries of slavery , and years of wandering in the desert a story of perseverance amidst persecution , and faith in God and the Torah . It is a story about finding freedom in your own land . And for the Jewish people , this story is central to who you have become . But it is also a story that holds within it the universal human experience , with all of its suffering , but also all of its salvation . It is a part of the three great religions Judaism , Christianity , and Islam that trace their origins to Abraham , and see Jerusalem as sacred . And it is a story that is inspired communities across the globe , including me and my fellow Americans . In the United States a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew we are naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land . To African Americans , the story of the Exodus was perhaps the central story , the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today . For generations , this promise helped people weather poverty and persecution , while holding on to the hope that a better day was on the horizon . For me , personally , growing up in far flung parts of the world and without firm roots , the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home . Of course , even as we draw strength from the story of God s will and His gift of freedom expressed on Passover , we also know that here on Earth we must bear our responsibilities in an imperfect world . That means accepting our measure of sacrifice and struggle , just like previous generations . It means us working through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom . As Dr . Martin Luther King said on the day before he was killed , I may not get there with you . But I want you to know that we , as a people , will get to the promised land . So just as Joshua carried on after Moses , the work goes on for all of you , the Joshua Generation , for justice and dignity for opportunity and freedom . For the Jewish people , the journey to the promise of the State of Israel wound through countless generations . It involved centuries of suffering and exile , prejudice and pogroms and even genocide . Through it all , the Jewish people sustained their unique identity and traditions , as well as a longing to return home . And while Jews achieved extraordinary success in many parts of the world , the dream of true freedom finally found its full expression in the Zionist idea to be a free people in your homeland . That is why I believe that Israel is rooted not just in history and tradition , but also in a simple and profound idea the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own . Over the last 65 years , when Israel has been at its best , Israelis have demonstrated that responsibility does not end when you reach the promised land , it only begins . And so Israel has been a refuge for the diaspora welcoming Jews from Europe , from the former Soviet Union , from Ethiopia , from North Africa . Israel has built a prosperous nation through kibbutzeem that made the desert bloom , business that broadened the middle class , innovators who reached new frontiers , from the smallest microchip to the orbits of space . Israel has established a thriving democracy , with a spirited civil society and proud political parties , and a tireless free press , and a lively public debate lively may even be an understatement . And Israel has achieved all this even as it is overcome relentless threats to its security through the courage of the Israel Defense Forces , and the citizenry that is so resilient in the face of terror . This is the story of Israel . This is the work that has brought the dreams of so many generations to life . And every step of the way , Israel has built unbreakable bonds of friendship with my country , the United States of America . Those ties began only 11 minutes after Israeli independence , when the United States was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel . As President Truman said in explaining his decision to recognize Israel , he said , I believe it has a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation , but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization . And since then , we have built a friendship that advances our shared interests . Together , we share a commitment to security for our citizens and the stability of the Middle East and North Africa . Together , we share a focus on advancing economic growth around the globe , and strengthening the middle class within our own countries . Together , we share a stake in the success of democracy . But the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests , just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders . America is a nation of immigrants . America is strengthened by diversity . America is enriched by faith . We are governed not simply by men and women , but by laws . We are fueled by entrepreneurship and innovation , and we are defined by a democratic discourse that allows each generation to reimagine and renew our union once more . So in Israel , we see values that we share , even as we recognize what makes us different . That is an essential part of our bond . Now , I stand here today mindful that for both our nations , these are some complicated times . We have difficult issues to work through within our own countries , and we face dangers and upheaval around the world . And when I look at young people within the United States , I think about the choices that they must make in their lives to define who we will be as a nation in this 21st century , particularly as we emerge from two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression . But part of the reason I like talking to young people is because no matter how great the challenges are , their idealism , their energy , their ambition always gives me hope . And I see the same spirit in the young people here today . I believe that you will shape our future . And given the ties between our countries , I believe your future is bound to ours . No , no this is part of the lively debate that we talked about . This is good . You know , I have to say we actually arranged for that , because it made me feel at home . I would not feel comfortable if I did not have at least one heckler . I had like to focus on how we and when I say we , in particular young people can work together to make progress in three areas that will define our times security , peace and prosperity . Let me begin with security . I am proud that the security relationship between the United States and Israel has never been stronger . Never . More exercises between our militaries more exchanges among our political and military and intelligence officials than ever before the largest program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge . These are the facts . These are not my opinions , these are facts . But , to me , this is not simply measured on a balance sheet . I know that here , in Israel , security is something personal . Here s what I think about when I consider these issues . When I consider Israel s security , I think about children like Osher Twito , who I met in Sderot children the same age as my own daughters who went to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they are and where they live . That reality is why we have invested in the Iron Dome system to save countless lives because those children deserve to sleep better at night . That is why we have made it clear , time and again , that Israel cannot accept rocket attacks from Gaza , and we have stood up for Israel s right to defend itself . And that is why Israel has a right to expect Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel s right to exist . When I think about Israel s security , I think about five Israelis who boarded a bus in Bulgaria , who were blown up because of where they came from robbed of the ability to live , and love , and raise families . That is why every country that values justice should call Hizbollah what it truly is a terrorist organization . Because the world cannot tolerate an organization that murders innocent civilians , stockpiles rockets to shoot at cities , and supports the massacre of men and women and children in Syria right now . The fact that Hizbollah s ally the Assad regime has stockpiles of chemical weapons only heightens the urgency . We will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger . I have made it clear to Bashar al Assad and all who follow his orders We will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people , or the transfer of those weapons to terrorists . The world is watching we will hold you accountable . The Syrian people have the right to be freed from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power . Assad must go so that Syria s future can begin . Because true stability in Syria depends upon establishing a government that is responsible to its people one that protects all communities within its borders , while making peace with countries beyond them . These are the things I think about when I think about Israel s security . When I consider Israel s security , I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust , faced with the prospect of a nuclear armed Iranian government that has called for Israel s destruction . It is no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat . But this is not simply a challenge for Israel it is a danger for the entire world , including the United States . A nuclear armed Iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism . It would undermine the non proliferation regime . It would spark an arms race in a volatile region . And it would embolden a government that has shown no respect for the rights of its own people or the responsibilities of nations . That is why America has built a coalition to increase the cost to Iran of failing to meet their obligations . The Iranian government is now under more pressure than ever before , and that pressure is increasing . It is isolated . Its economy is in dire straits . Its leadership is divided . And its position in the region , and the world has only grown weaker . I do believe that all of us have an interest in resolving this issue peacefully . Strong and principled diplomacy is the best way to ensure that the Iranian government forsakes nuclear weapons . Peace is far more preferable to war . And the inevitable costs , the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically . Because of the cooperation between our governments , we know that there remains time to pursue a diplomatic resolution . That is what America will do , with clear eyes working with a world that is united , and with the sense of urgency that is required . But Iran must know this time is not unlimited . And I have made the position of the United States of America clear Iran must not get a nuclear weapon . This is not a danger that can be contained , and as President , I have said all options are on the table for achieving our objectives . America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear armed Iran . For young Israelis , I know that these issues of security are rooted in an experience that is even more fundamental than the pressing threat of the day . You live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbors have rejected the right of your nation to exist . Your grandparents had to risk their lives and all that they had to make a place for themselves in this world . Your parents lived through war after war to ensure the survival of the Jewish state . Your children grow up knowing that people they have never met may hate them because of who they are , in a region that is full of turmoil and changing underneath your feet . So that is what I think about when Israel is faced with these challenges that sense of an Israel that is surrounded by many in this region who still reject it , and many in the world who refuse to accept it . And that is why the security of the Jewish people in Israel is so important . It cannot be taken for granted . But make no mistake those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel s right to exist , they might as well reject the earth beneath them or the sky above , because Israel is not going anywhere . And today , I want to tell you particularly the young people so that there is no mistake here , so long as there is a United States of America Atem lo levad . You are not alone . The question is what kind of future Israel will look forward to . Israel is not going anywhere but especially for the young people in this audience , the question is what does its future hold And that brings me to the subject of peace . I know Israel has taken risks for peace . Brave leaders Menachem Begin , Yitzhak Rabin reached treaties with two of your neighbors . You made credible proposals to the Palestinians at Annapolis . You withdrew from Gaza and Lebanon , and then faced terror and rockets . Across the region , you have extended a hand of friendship and all too often you have been confronted with rejection and , in some cases , the ugly reality of anti Semitism . So I believe that the Israeli people do want peace , and I also understand why too many Israelis maybe an increasing number , maybe a lot of young people here today are skeptical that it can be achieved . But today , Israel is at a crossroads . It can be tempting to put aside the frustrations and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of peace , particularly when Iron Dome repels rockets , barriers keep out suicide bombers . There is so many other pressing issues that demand your attention . And I know that only Israelis can make the fundamental decisions about your country s future . I recognize that . I also know , by the way , that not everyone in this hall will agree with what I have to say about peace . I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace , but question its underlying premise , have a different vision for Israel s future . And that is part of a democracy . That is part of the discourse between our two countries . I recognize that . But I also believe it is important to be open and honest , especially with your friends . I also believe that . Politically , given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America , the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside just express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do that would be the easiest political path . But I want you to know that I speak to you as a friend who is deeply concerned and committed to your future , and I ask you to consider three points . First , peace is necessary . I believe that . I believe that peace is the only path to true security . You have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream , or you can face a growing challenge to its future . Given the demographics west of the Jordan River , the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine . That is true . There are other factors involved . Given the frustration in the international community about this conflict , Israel needs to reverse an undertow of isolation . And given the march of technology , the only way to truly protect the Israeli people over the long term is through the absence of war . Because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that is intent on doing so from inflicting harm . And this truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world . I understand that with the uncertainty in the region people in the streets , changes in leadership , the rise of non secular parties in politics it is tempting to turn inward , because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic . But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace . Because as more governments respond to popular will , the days when Israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leaders , those days are over . Peace will have to be made among peoples , not just governments . No one no single step can change overnight what lies in the hearts and minds of millions . No single step is going to erase years of history and propaganda . But progress with the Palestinians is a powerful way to begin , while sidelining extremists who thrive on conflict and thrive on division . It would make a difference . So peace is necessary . But peace is also just . Peace is also just . There is no question that Israel has faced Palestinian factions who turned to terror , leaders who missed historic opportunities . That is all true . And that is why security must be at the center of any agreement . And there is no question that the only path to peace is through negotiations which is why , despite the criticism we have received , the United States will oppose unilateral efforts to bypass negotiations through the United Nations . It has to be done by the parties . But the Palestinian people s right to self determination , their right to justice , must also be recognized . Put yourself in their shoes . Look at the world through their eyes . It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of their own . Living their entire lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements not just of those young people but their parents , their grandparents , every single day . It is not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished . It is not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands or restricting a student s ability to move around the West Bank or displace Palestinian families from their homes . Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer . Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland , Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land . I am going off script here for a second , but before I came here , I met with a group of young Palestinians from the age of 15 to 22 . And talking to them , they were not that different from my daughters . They were not that different from your daughters or sons . I honestly believe that if any Israeli parent sat down with those kids , they had say , I want these kids to succeed I want them to prosper . I want them to have opportunities just like my kids do . I believe that is what Israeli parents would want for these kids if they had a chance to listen to them and talk to them . I believe that . Now , only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have . But remember that as you make these decisions , you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the Palestinians you will define the future of Israel as well . As Ariel Sharon said I am quoting him It is impossible to have a Jewish democratic state , at the same time to control all of Eretz Israel . If we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety , we are liable to lose it all . Or , from a different perspective , I think of what the novelist David Grossman said shortly after losing his son , as he described the necessity of peace A peace of no choice he said , must be approached with the same determination and creativity as one approaches a war of no choice . Now , Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with anyone who is dedicated to its destruction . But while I know you have had differences with the Palestinian Authority , I genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad . I believe that . And they have a track record to prove it . Over the last few years , they have built institutions and maintained security on the West Bank in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago . So many Palestinians including young people have rejected violence as a means of achieving their aspirations . There is an opportunity there , there is a window which brings me to my third point Peace is possible . It is possible . I am not saying it is guaranteed . I cannot even say that it is more likely than not . But it is possible . I know it does not seem that way . There are always going to be reasons to avoid risk . There are costs for failure . There will always be extremists who provide an excuse not to act . I know there must be something exhausting about endless talks about talks , and daily controversies , and just the grinding status quo . And I am sure there is a temptation just to say , Ah , enough . Let me focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what I can control . But it is possible . Negotiations will be necessary , but there is little secret about where they must lead two states for two peoples . Two states for two peoples . There will be differences about how to get there . There are going to be hard choices along the way . Arab states must adapt to a world that has changed . The days when they could condemn Israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity , or government corruption or mismanagement those days need to be over . Now is the time for the Arab world to take steps toward normalizing relations with Israel . Meanwhile , Palestinians must recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security . Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace , and that an independent Palestine must be viable with real borders that have to be drawn . I have suggested principles on territory and security that I believe can be the basis for these talks . But for the moment , put aside the plans and the process . I ask you , instead , to think about what can be done to build trust between people . Four years ago , I stood in Cairo in front of an audience of young people politically , religiously , they must seem a world away . But the things they want , they are not so different from what the young people here want . They want the ability to make their own decisions and to get an education , get a good job to worship God in their own way to get married to raise a family . The same is true of those young Palestinians that I met with this morning . The same is true for young Palestinians who yearn for a better life in Gaza . That is where peace begins not just in the plans of leaders , but in the hearts of people . Not just in some carefully designed process , but in the daily connections that sense of empathy that takes place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of Jerusalem . And let me say this as a politician I can promise you this , political leaders will never take risks if the people do not push them to take some risks . You must create the change that you want to see . Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things . I know this is possible . Look to the bridges being built in business and civil society by some of you here today . Look at the young people who have not yet learned a reason to mistrust , or those young people who have learned to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherited from their parents , because they simply recognize that we hold more hopes in common than fears that drive us apart . Your voices must be louder than those who would drown out hope . Your hopes must light the way forward . Look to a future in which Jews and Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land . Believe in that . And most of all , look to the future that you want for your own children a future in which a Jewish , democratic , vibrant state is protected and accepted for this time and for all time . There will be many who say this change is not possible , but remember this Israel is the most powerful country in this region . Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world . Israel is not going anywhere . Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is , but this is in your nature Israel also has the courage to see the world as it should be . Ben Gurion once said , In Israel , in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles . Sometimes , the greatest miracle is recognizing that the world can change . That is a lesson that the world has learned from the Jewish people . And that brings me to the final area that I will focus on prosperity , and Israel s broader role in the world . I know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headlines , but that is not where people live . And every day , even amidst the threats that you face , Israelis are defining themselves by the opportunities that you are creating . Through talent and hard work , Israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy . Israelis understand the value of education and have produced 10 Nobel laureates . Israelis understand the power of invention , and your universities educate engineers and inventors . And that spirit has led to economic growth and human progress solar power and electric cars , bandages and prosthetic limbs that save lives , stem cell research and new drugs that treat disease , cell phones and computer technology that changed the way people around the world live . So if people want to see the future of the world economy , they should look at Tel Aviv , home to hundreds of start ups and research centers . Israelis are so active on social media that every day seemed to bring a different Facebook campaign about where I should give this speech . That innovation is just as important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as our security cooperation . Our first free trade agreement in the world was reached with Israel , nearly three decades ago . Today the trade between our two countries is at 40 billion every year . More importantly , that partnership is creating new products and medical treatments it is pushing new frontiers of science and exploration . That is the kind of relationship that Israel should have and could have with every country in the world . Already , we see how that innovation could reshape this region . There is a program here in Jerusalem that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to learn vital skills in technology and business . An Israeli and Palestinian have started a venture capital fund to finance Palestinian start ups . Over 100 high tech companies have found a home on the West Bank which speaks to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the Palestinian people . One of the great ironies of what is happening in the broader region is that so much of what people are yearning for education , entrepreneurship , the ability to start a business without paying a bribe , the ability to connect to the global economy those are things that can be found here in Israel . This should be a hub for thriving regional trade , and an engine for opportunity . Israel is already a center for innovation that helps power the global economy . And I believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhanced with greater security , enhanced with lasting peace . Here , in this small strip of land that has been the center of so much of the world s history , so much triumph and so much tragedy , Israelis have built something that few could have imagined 65 years ago . Tomorrow , I will pay tribute to that history at the grave of Herzl , a man who had the foresight to see the future of the Jewish people had to be reconnected to their past at the grave of Rabin , who understood that Israel s victories in war had to be followed by the battles for peace at Yad Vashem , where the world is reminded of the cloud of evil that can descend on the Jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant . We bear all that history on our shoulders . We carry all that history in our hearts . Today , as we face the twilight of Israel s founding generation , you the young people of Israel must now claim its future . It falls to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation . And as the President of a country that you can count on as your greatest friend I am confident that you can help us find the promise in the days that lie ahead . And as a man who is been inspired in my own life by that timeless calling within the Jewish experience tikkun olam I am hopeful that we can draw upon what is best in ourselves to meet the challenges that will come to win the battles for peace in the wake of so much war and to do the work of repairing this world . That is your job . That is my job . That is the task of all of us . May God bless you . May God bless Israel . May God bless the United States of America . Toda raba . Thank you .I wanted to come out here , first of all , to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session . The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks , there is going to obviously be a whole range of issues immigration , economics , et cetera we will try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions . The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions , but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling . I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday . But watching the debate over the course of the last week , I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit . First of all , I want to make sure that , once again , I send my thoughts and prayers , as well as Michelle s , to the family of Trayvon Martin , and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they have dealt with the entire situation . I can only imagine what they are going through , and it is remarkable how they have handled it . The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday , which is there is going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case I will let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues . The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner . The prosecution and the defense made their arguments . The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant , and they rendered a verdict . And once the jury has spoken , that is how our system works . But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling . You know , when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son . Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago . And when you think about why , in the African American community at least , there is a lot of pain around what happened here , I think it is important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does not go away . There are very few African American men in this country who have not had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store . That includes me . There are very few African American men who have not had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars . That happens to me at least before I was a senator . There are very few African Americans who have not had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off . That happens often . And I do not want to exaggerate this , but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida . And it is inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear . The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws . And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case . Now , this is not to say that the African American community is na iuml ve about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence . It is not to make excuses for that fact although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context . They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country , and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history . And so the fact that sometimes that is unacknowledged adds to the frustration . And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given , well , there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain . I think the African American community is also not na iuml ve in understanding that , statistically , somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else . So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys . But they get frustrated , I think , if they feel that there is no context for it and that context is being denied . And that all contributes I think to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario , that , from top to bottom , both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different . Now , the question for me at least , and I think for a lot of folks , is where do we take this How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction I think it is understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests , and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through , as long as it remains nonviolent . If I see any violence , then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family . But beyond protests or vigils , the question is , are there some concrete things that we might be able to do . I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there , but I think it is important for people to have some clear expectations here . Traditionally , these are issues of state and local government , the criminal code . And law enforcement is traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal levels . That does not mean , though , that as a nation we cannot do some things that I think would be productive . So let me just give a couple of specifics that I am still bouncing around with my staff , so we are not rolling out some five point plan , but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus . Number one , precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level , I think it would be productive for the Justice Department , governors , mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists . When I was in Illinois , I passed racial profiling legislation , and it actually did just two simple things . One , it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped . But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing . And initially , the police departments across the state were resistant , but actually they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair , straightforward way that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and , in turn , be more helpful in applying the law . And obviously , law enforcement has got a very tough job . So that is one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if state and local governments are receptive . And I think a lot of them would be . And let us figure out are there ways for us to push out that kind of training . Along the same lines , I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case , rather than diffuse potential altercations . I know that there is been commentary about the fact that the stand your ground laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case . On the other hand , if we are sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there is a way for them to exit from a situation , is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we had like to see And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these stand your ground laws , I had just ask people to consider , if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed , could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr . Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous , then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws . Number three and this is a long term project we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys . And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about . There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement . And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them I am not na iuml ve about the prospects of some grand , new federal program . I am not sure that that is what we are talking about here . But I do recognize that as President , I have got some convening power , and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front . And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes , and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they are a full part of this society and that they have got pathways and avenues to succeed I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation . And we are going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that . And then , finally , I think it is going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching . There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race . I have not seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations . They end up being stilted and politicized , and folks are locked into the positions they already have . On the other hand , in families and churches and workplaces , there is the possibility that people are a little bit more honest , and at least you ask yourself your own questions about , am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can Am I judging people as much as I can , based on not the color of their skin , but the content of their character That would , I think , be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy . And let me just leave you with a final thought that , as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people , I do not want us to lose sight that things are getting better . Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race . It does not mean we are in a post racial society . It does not mean that racism is eliminated . But when I talk to Malia and Sasha , and I listen to their friends and I seem them interact , they are better than we are they are better than we were on these issues . And that is true in every community that I have visited all across the country . And so we have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues . And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature , as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions . But we should also have confidence that kids these days , I think , have more sense than we did back then , and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long , difficult journey , we are becoming a more perfect union not a perfect union , but a more perfect union . Thank you , guys .My fellow Americans , tonight , I had like to talk with you about immigration . For more than 200 years , our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations . It is kept us youthful , dynamic , and entrepreneurial . It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities people not trapped by our past , but able to remake ourselves as we choose . But today , our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it . Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules . Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less . All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America . And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows , or risk their families being torn apart . It is been this way for decades . And for decades , we have not done much about it . When I took office , I committed to fixing this broken immigration system . And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders . Today , we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history . And over the past six years , illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half . Although this summer , there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border , the number of such children is now actually lower than it is been in nearly two years . Overall , the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s . Those are the facts . Meanwhile , I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix , and last year , 68 Democrats , Republicans , and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate . It was not perfect . It was a compromise . But it reflected common sense . It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine , started paying their taxes , and went to the back of the line . And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits . Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes or no vote , it would have passed with support from both parties , and today it would be the law . But for a year and a half now , Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote . Now , I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law . But until that happens , there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just . Tonight , I am announcing those actions . First , we will build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings , and speed the return of those who do cross over . Second , I will make it easier and faster for high skilled immigrants , graduates , and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy , as so many business leaders have proposed . Third , we will take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country . I want to say more about this third issue , because it generates the most passion and controversy . Even as we are a nation of immigrants , we are also a nation of laws . Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws , and I believe that they must be held accountable especially those who may be dangerous . That is why , over the past six years , deportations of criminals are up 80 percent . And that is why we are going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security . Felons , not families . Criminals , not children . Gang members , not a mom who is working hard to provide for her kids . We will prioritize , just like law enforcement does every day . But even as we focus on deporting criminals , the fact is , millions of immigrants in every state , of every race and nationality still live here illegally . And let us be honest tracking down , rounding up , and deporting millions of people is not realistic . Anyone who suggests otherwise is not being straight with you . It is also not who we are as Americans . After all , most of these immigrants have been here a long time . They work hard , often in tough , low paying jobs . They support their families . They worship at our churches . Many of their kids are American born or spent most of their lives here , and their hopes , dreams , and patriotism are just like ours . As my predecessor , President Bush , once put it They are a part of American life . Now here s the thing We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules . We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded . So we are going to offer the following deal If you have been in America for more than five years if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents if you register , pass a criminal background check , and you are willing to pay your fair share of taxes you will be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation . You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . That is what this deal is . Now , let us be clear about what it is not . This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently . It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future . It does not grant citizenship , or the right to stay here permanently , or offer the same benefits that citizens receive only Congress can do that . All we are saying is we are not going to deport you . I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty . Well , it is not . Amnesty is the immigration system we have today millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time . That is the real amnesty leaving this broken system the way it is . Mass amnesty would be unfair . Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character . What I am describing is accountability a common sense , middle ground approach If you meet the criteria , you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . If you are a criminal , you will be deported . If you plan to enter the illegally , your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up . The actions I am taking are not only lawful , they are the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century . And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better , or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed , I have one answer Pass a bill . I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution . And the day I sign that bill into law , the actions I take will no longer be necessary . Meanwhile , do not let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue . That is not how our democracy works , and Congress certainly should not shut down our government again just because we disagree on this . Americans are tired of gridlock . What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose a higher purpose . Most Americans support the types of reforms I have talked about tonight . But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home . Millions of us , myself included , go back generations in this country , with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens . So we do not like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship . I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are , or take our jobs , or stick it to middle class families at a time when they already feel like they have gotten the raw deal for over a decade . I hear these concerns . But that is not what these steps would do . Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society . And I believe it is important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other s character . Because for all the back and forth of Washington , we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger . It is about who we are as a country , and who we want to be for future generations . Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends , take responsibility , and give their kids a better future Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents arms Or are we a nation that values families , and works together to keep them together Are we a nation that educates the world s best and brightest in our universities , only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here , create businesses here , create industries right here in America That is what this debate is all about . We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration . We need reasoned , thoughtful , compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes , not our fears . I know the politics of this issue are tough . But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it . Over the past few years , I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government , and at risk any moment of losing it all , just to build a better life for their kids . I have seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they did not have the right papers . I have seen the courage of students who , except for the circumstances of their birth , are as American as Malia or Sasha students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love . These people our neighbors , our classmates , our friends they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life . They came to work , and study , and serve in our military , and above all , contribute to America s success . Tomorrow , I will travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students , including a young woman named Astrid Silva . Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old . Her only possessions were a cross , her doll , and the frilly dress she had on . When she started school , she did not speak any English . She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBand she became a good student . Her father worked in landscaping . Her mom cleaned other people s homes . They would not let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school , not because they did not love her , but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant so she applied behind their back and got in . Still , she mostly lived in the shadows until her grandmother , who visited every year from Mexico , passed away , and she could not travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported . It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her , and today , Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree . Are we a nation that kicks out a striving , hopeful immigrant like Astrid , or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger , for we know the heart of a stranger we were strangers once , too . My fellow Americans , we are and always will be a nation of immigrants . We were strangers once , too . And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic , or the Pacific , or the Rio Grande , we are here only because this country welcomed them in , and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like , or what our last names are , or how we worship . What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal , and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will . That is the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us . That is the tradition we must uphold . That is the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless this country we love .
