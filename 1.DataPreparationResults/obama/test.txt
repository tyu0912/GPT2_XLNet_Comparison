Madam Speaker , Mr . Vice President , Members of Congress , the First Lady of the United States she is around here somewhere I have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great Chamber , but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here . I know that for many Americans watching right now , the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others , and rightly so . If you have not been personally affected by this recession , you probably know someone who has a friend , a neighbor , a member of your family . You do not need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis , because you live it every day . It is the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights . It is the job you thought you had retire from but now have lost , the business you built your dreams upon that is now hanging by a thread , the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope . The impact of this recession is real , and it is everywhere . But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation . The answers to our problems do not lie beyond our reach . They exist in our laboratories and our universities , in our fields and our factories , in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth . Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history , we still possess in ample measure . What is required now is for this country to pull together , confront boldly the challenges we face , and take responsibility for our future once more . Now , if we are honest with ourselves , we will admit that for too long , we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people . I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards , but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we will be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament . The fact is , our economy did not fall into decline overnight , nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank . We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy , yet we import more oil today than ever before . The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year , yet we keep delaying reform . Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for . And though all these challenges went unsolved , we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt , both as individuals and through our Government , than ever before . In other words , we have lived through an era where too often short term gains were prized over long term prosperity , where we failed to look beyond the next payment , the next quarter , or the next election . A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future . Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market . People bought homes they knew they could not afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway . And all the while , critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time , on some other day . Well , that day of reckoning has arrived , and the time to take charge of our future is here . Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy , but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity . Now is the time to jumpstart job creation , restart lending , and invest in areas like energy , health care , and education that will grow our economy , even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down . That is what my economic agenda is designed to do , and that is what I had like to talk to you about tonight . It is an agenda that begins with jobs . As soon as I took office , I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets , not because I believe in bigger Government I do not not because I am not mindful of the massive debt we have inherited I am . I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship . In fact , a failure to act would have worsened our long term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years . And that is why I pushed for quick action . And tonight I am grateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law . Over the next 2 years , this plan will save or create 3 . 5 million jobs . More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges , constructing wind turbines and solar panels , laying broadband and expanding mass transit . Because of this plan , there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids , health care professionals can continue caring for our sick . There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make . Because of this plan , 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st . Because of this plan , families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a 2 , 500 tax credit for all 4 years of college , and Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm . Now , I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work , and I understand that skepticism . Here in Washington , we have all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending . And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right . And that is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough , unprecedented oversight effort because nobody messes with Joe . I am I right They do not mess with him . I have told each of my Cabinet , as well as mayors and Governors across the country , that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend . I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud . And we have created a new web site called recovery . gov , so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent . So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track . But it is just the first step . Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly , there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system . I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight , because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family s well being . You should also know that the money you have deposited in banks across the country is safe , your insurance is secure , you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system . That is not the source of concern . The concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country , our recovery will be choked off before it even begins . You see , the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy . The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education , how stores stock their shelves , farms buy equipment , and businesses make payroll . But credit has stopped flowing the way it should . Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks . And with so much debt and so little confidence , these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households , to businesses , or even to each other . And when there is no lending , families cannot afford to buy homes or cars , so businesses are forced to make layoffs . Our economy suffers even more , and credit dries up even further . That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle , to restore confidence , and restart lending . And we will do so in several ways . First , we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans , college loans , and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running . Second , we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages . It is a plan that will not help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford , but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about . In fact , the average family who refinances today can save nearly 2 , 000 per year on their mortgage . Third , we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times . And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems , we will hold accountable those responsible , force the necessary adjustments , provide the support to clean up their balance sheets , and assure the continuity of a strong , viable institution that can serve our people and our economy . Now , I understand that on any given day , Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions . But such an approach will not solve the problem , and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all . And I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive , and this time , they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer . This time , CEOs will not be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet . Those days are over . Still , this plan will require significant resources from the Federal Government and , yes , probably more than we have already set aside . But while the cost of action will be great , I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater , for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years , but perhaps a decade . That would be worse for our deficit , worse for business , worse for you , and worse for the next generation . And I refuse to let that happen . Now , I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks , Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed . So were the American taxpayers so was So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now , especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions . I promise you , I get it . But I also know that in a time of crisis , we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment . My job our job is to solve the problem . Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility . I will not send I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive , but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that cannot pay its workers or the family that has saved and still cannot get a mortgage . That is what this is about . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . It is not about helping banks it is about helping people . Because when credit is available again , that young family can finally buy a new home . And then some company will hire workers to build it . And then those workers will have money to spend . And if they can get a loan too , maybe they will finally buy that car or open their own business . Investors will return to the market , and American families will see their retirement secured once more . Slowly but surely , confidence will return and our economy will recover . So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary , because we cannot consign our Nation to an open ended recession . And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system . It is time to put in place tough , new , commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation , and punishes shortcuts and abuse . The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we are taking to revive our economy in the short term . But the only way to fully restore America s economic strength is to make the long term investments that will lead to new jobs , new industries , and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world . The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care , the schools that are not preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit . That is our responsibility . In the next few days , I will submit a budget to Congress . So often , we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs . I see this document differently . I see it as a vision for America , as a blueprint for our future . My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue . It reflects the stark reality of what we have inherited , a trillion dollar deficit , a financial crisis , and a costly recession . Given these realities , everyone in this Chamber , Democrats and Republicans , will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars . And that includes me . But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long term challenges . I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves , that says Government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity . For history tells a different story . History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation , this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas . In the midst of Civil War , we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry . From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age . In the wake of war and depression , the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history . And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways , an American on the Moon , and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world . In each case , Government did not supplant private enterprise it catalyzed private enterprise . It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive . We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal . Now we must be that nation again , and that is why , even as it cuts back on programs we do not need , the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future energy , health care , and education . It begins with energy . We know the country that harnesses the power of clean , renewable energy will lead the 21st century . And yet , it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient . We invented solar technology , but we have fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it . New plug in hybrids roll off our assembly lines , but they will run on batteries made in Korea . Well , I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders , and I know you do not either . It is time for America to lead again . Thanks to our recovery plan , we will double this Nation s supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years . We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history , an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology . We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country . And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills . But to truly transform our economy , to protect our security , and save our planet from the ravages of climate change , we need to ultimately make clean , renewable energy the profitable kind of energy . So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America . That is what we need . And to support that innovation , we will invest 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power , advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . Speaking of our auto industry , everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink . We should not , and will not , protect them from their own bad practices . But we are committed to the goal of a retooled , reimagined auto industry that can compete and win . Millions of jobs depend on it scores of communities depend on it . And I believe the Nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it . Now , none of this will come without cost , nor will it be easy . But this is America . We do not do what is easy . We do what is necessary to move this country forward . And for that same reason , we must also address the crushing cost of health care . This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds . By the end of the year , it could cause 1 . 5 million Americans to lose their homes . In the last 8 years , premiums have grown four times faster than wages . And in each of these years , 1 million more Americans have lost their health insurance . It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas . And it is one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget . Given these facts , we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold . We cannot afford to do it . It is time . Already , we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than we have done in the last decade . When it was days old , this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time . Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records , a new technology that will reduce errors , bring down costs , ensure privacy , and save lives . It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American , including me , by seeking a cure for cancer in our time . And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care , because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control . This budget builds on these reforms . It includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform , a down payment on the principle that we must have quality , affordable health care for every American . It is a commitment that is paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue . And it is a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come . Now , there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform , and that is why I am bringing together businesses and workers , doctors and health care providers , Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week . I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process . Once again , it will be hard . But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform , the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough . So let there be no doubt Health care reform cannot wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America . In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge , a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity , it is a prerequisite . Right now , three quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma . And yet , just over half of our citizens have that level of education . We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation , and half of the students who begin college never finish . This is a prescription for economic decline , because we know the countries that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow . That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education , from the day they are born to the day they begin a career . That is a promise we have to make to the children of America . Already , we have made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan . We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality , because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life . We have made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students 7 million . And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children s progress . But we know that our schools do not just need more resources , they need more reform . And that is why this budget creates new teachers new incentives for teacher performance , pathways for advancement , and rewards for success . We will invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps , and we will expand our commitment to charter schools . It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work . But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it . So tonight I ask every American to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training . This can be community college or a 4 year school , vocational training or an apprenticeship . But whatever the training may be , every American will need to get more than a high school diploma . And dropping out of high school is no longer an option . It is not just quitting on yourself , it is quitting on your country , and this country needs and values the talents of every American . That is why we will support we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans to complete college and meet a new goal . By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . That is a goal we can meet . That is a goal we can meet . Now , I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever , which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country , we will make sure that you can afford a higher education . And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations , I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch , as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country , Senator Edward Kennedy . These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children , but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them . In the end , there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent , for a mother or father who will attend those parent teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the Tput away the video games , read to their child . I speak to you not just as a President , but as a father , when I say that responsibility for our children s education must begin at home . That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue that is an American issue . There is , of course , another responsibility we have to our children . And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay . That is critical . I agree , absolutely . See , I know we can get some consensus in here . With the deficit we inherited , the cost of the crisis we face , and the long term challenges we must meet , it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers , we do what it takes to bring this deficit down . That is critical . Now , I am proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks , and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities . And yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office . My administration has also begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs . As you can imagine , this is a process that will take some time . But we have already identified 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . In this budget , we will end education programs that do not work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that do not need them . We will eliminate the no bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we are not paying for cold war era weapons systems we do not use . We will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that does not make our seniors any healthier . We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax Code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas . In order to save our children from a future of debt , we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Now , let me be clear let me be absolutely clear , because I know you will end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people If your family earns less than 250 , 000 a year , a quarter million dollars a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . I repeat Not one single dime . In fact not a dime in fact , the recovery plan provides a tax cut that is right , a tax cut for 95 percent of working families . And by the way , these checks are on the way . Now , to preserve our long term fiscal health , we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security . Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come . And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security , while creating tax free universal savings accounts for all Americans . Finally , because we are also suffering from a deficit of trust , I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget . That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules . And for the first time , that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . For 7 years , we have been a nation at war . No longer will we hide its price . Along with our outstanding national security team , I am now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars , and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war . And with our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat extremism , because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world . We will not allow it . As we meet here tonight , our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy . To each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence , Americans are united in sending one message We honor your service we are inspired by your sacrifice and you have our unyielding support . To relieve the strain on our forces , my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines . And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve , we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned . To overcome extremism , we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend , because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America . And that is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists . Because living our values does not make us weaker , it makes us safer and it makes us stronger . And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture . We can make that commitment here tonight . In words and deeds , we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun . For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone , but the world cannot meet them without America . We cannot shun the negotiating table , nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm . We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand . To seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors , we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort . To meet the challenges of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear proliferation , from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty we will strengthen old alliances , forge new ones , and use all elements of our national power . And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope , we are working with the nations of the G 20 to restore confidence in our financial system , avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism , and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe . For the world depends on us having a strong economy , just as our economy depends on the strength of the world s . As we stand at this crossroads of history , the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us , watching to see what we do with this moment , waiting for us to lead . Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times . It is a tremendous burden , but also a great privilege , one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans . For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill . I know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth , to become cynical and doubtful , consumed with the petty and the trivial . But in my life , I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places , that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity , but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are anything but ordinary . I think of Leonard Abess , a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company , took a 60 million bonus , and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him , plus another 72 who used to work for him . He did not tell anyone , but when the local newspaper found out , he simply said , I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old . It did not feel right getting the money myself . I think about Greensburg , Kansas , a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado , but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community , how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay . The tragedy was terrible , said one of the men who helped them rebuild . But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity . I think about Ty Sheoma Bethea , the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon , South Carolina , a place where the ceilings leak , the paint peels off the walls , and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom . She had been told that her school is hopeless , but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber . She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp . The letter asks us for help and says We are just students trying to become lawyers , doctors , Congressmen like yourself , and one day President , so we can make a change to not just the State of South Carolina but also the world . We are not quitters . That is what she said We are not quitters . These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here . They tell us that even in the most trying times , amid the most difficult circumstances , there is a generosity , a resilience , a decency , and a determination that perseveres , a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity . Their resolve must be our inspiration . Their concerns must be our cause . And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us . I know look , I know that we have not agreed on every issue thus far . There are surely times in the future where we will part ways . But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed . I know that . That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done . That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground . And if we do , if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths of this crisis , if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity , if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit , then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed , in the words that are carved into this very Chamber , something worthy to be remembered . Thank you . God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>Good evening . To the United States Corps of Cadets , to the men and women of our Armed Services , and to my fellow Americans I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan the nature of our commitment there , the scope of our interests , and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion . It is an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security , and to represent what is finest about our country . To address these important issues , it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place . We did not ask for this fight . On September 11 , 2001 , 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3 , 000 people . They struck at our military and economic nerve centers . They took the lives of innocent men , women , and children without regard to their faith or race or station . Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers onboard one of those flights , they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington , and killed many more . As we know , these men belonged to al Qaeda a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam , one of the world s great religions , to justify the slaughter of innocents . Al Qaeda s base of operations was in Afghanistan , where they were harbored by the Taliban a ruthless , repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war , and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere . Just days after 9 11 , Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them an authorization that continues to this day . The vote in the Senate was 98 to nothing . The vote in the House was 420 to 1 . For the first time in its history , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all . And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9 11 attacks . America , our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda s terrorist network and to protect our common security . Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden we sent our troops into Afghanistan . Within a matter of months , al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed . The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels . A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope . At a conference convened by the N . , a provisional government was established under President Hamid Karzai . And an International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war torn country . Then , in early 2003 , the decision was made to wage a second war , in Iraq . The wrenching debate over the Iraq war is well known and need not be repeated here . It is enough to say that for the next six years , the Iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops , our resources , our diplomacy , and our national attention and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world . Today , after extraordinary costs , we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end . We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer , and all of our troops by the end of 2011 . That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and women in uniform . Thanks to their courage , grit and perseverance , we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future , and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people . But while we have achieved hard earned milestones in Iraq , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated . After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002 , al Qaeda s leadership established a safe haven there . Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people , it is been hampered by corruption , the drug trade , an under developed economy , and insufficient security forces . Over the last several years , the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda , as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government . Gradually , the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory in Afghanistan , while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorism against the Pakistani people . Now , throughout this period , our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq . When I took office , we had just over 32 , 000 Americans serving in Afghanistan , compared to 160 , 000 in Iraq at the peak of the war . Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban , but these reinforcements did not arrive . And that is why , shortly after taking office , I approved a longstanding request for more troops . After consultations with our allies , I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan . I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting , dismantling , and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies , and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts . Since then , we have made progress on some important objectives . High ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed , and we have stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda worldwide . In Pakistan , that nation s army has gone on its largest offensive in years . In Afghanistan , we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election , and although it was marred by fraud that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan s laws and constitution . Yet huge challenges remain . Afghanistan is not lost , but for several years it has moved backwards . There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown , but the Taliban has gained momentum . Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9 11 , but they retain their safe havens along the border . And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population . Our new commander in Afghanistan General McChrystal has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated . In short The status quo is not sustainable . As cadets , you volunteered for service during this time of danger . Some of you fought in Afghanistan . Some of you will deploy there . As your Commander in Chief , I owe you a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of your service . And that is why , after the Afghan voting was completed , I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy . Now , let me be clear There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 , so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period . Instead , the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions , and to explore all the different options , along with my national security team , our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan , and our key partners . And given the stakes involved , I owed the American people and our troops no less . This review is now complete . And as Commander in Chief , I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30 , 000 troops to Afghanistan . After 18 months , our troops will begin to come home . These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative , while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan . I do not make this decision lightly . I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force , and always consider the long term consequences of our actions . We have been at war now for eight years , at enormous cost in lives and resources . Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters , and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort . And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home . Most of all , I know that this decision asks even more of you a military that , along with your families , has already borne the heaviest of all burdens . As President , I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars . I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed . I visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed . I have traveled to Dover to meet the flag draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place . I see firsthand the terrible wages of war . If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan , I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow . So , no , I do not make this decision lightly . I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan . This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda . It is from here that we were attacked on 9 11 , and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak . This is no idle danger no hypothetical threat . In the last few months alone , we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror . And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards , and al Qaeda can operate with impunity . We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and to do that , we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region . Of course , this burden is not ours alone to bear . This is not just America s war . Since 9 11 , al Qaeda s safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali . The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered . And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear armed Pakistan , because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons , and we have every reason to believe that they would use them . These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies . Our overarching goal remains the same to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future . To meet that goal , we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan . We must deny al Qaeda a safe haven . We must reverse the Taliban s momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government . And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan s security forces and government so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan s future . We will meet these objectives in three ways . First , we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban s momentum and increase Afghanistan s capacity over the next 18 months . The 30 , 000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 the fastest possible pace so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers . They will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces , and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight . And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans . Because this is an international effort , I have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies . Some have already provided additional troops , and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead . Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan . And now , we must come together to end this war successfully . For what is at stake is not simply a test of NATO s credibility what is at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world . But taken together , these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces , and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011 . Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly , taking into account conditions on the ground . We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul . But it will be clear to the Afghan government and , more importantly , to the Afghan people that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country . Second , we will work with our partners , the United Nations , and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy , so that the government can take advantage of improved security . This effort must be based on performance . The days of providing a blank check are over . President Karzai s inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction . And going forward , we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance . We will support Afghan ministries , governors , and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people . We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable . And we will also focus our assistance in areas such as agriculture that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people . The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades . They have been confronted with occupation by the Soviet Union , and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes . So tonight , I want the Afghan people to understand America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering . We have no interest in occupying your country . We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens . And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the day when our troops will leave and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner , and never your patron . Third , we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan . We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country . But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan . That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border . In the past , there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight , and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence . But in recent years , as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad , it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism . Public opinion has turned . The Pakistani army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan . And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy . In the past , we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly . Those days are over . Moving forward , we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interest , mutual respect , and mutual trust . We will strengthen Pakistan s capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries , and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear . America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan s democracy and development . We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting . And going forward , the Pakistan people must know America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan s security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent , so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed . These are the three core elements of our strategy a military effort to create the conditions for a transition a civilian surge that reinforces positive action and an effective partnership with Pakistan . I recognize there are a range of concerns about our approach . So let me briefly address a few of the more prominent arguments that I have heard , and which I take very seriously . First , there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam . They argue that it cannot be stabilized , and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing . I believe this argument depends on a false reading of history . Unlike Vietnam , we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action . Unlike Vietnam , we are not facing a broad based popular insurgency . And most importantly , unlike Vietnam , the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border . To abandon this area now and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies . Second , there are those who acknowledge that we cannot leave Afghanistan in its current state , but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have . But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through , and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there . It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan , because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over . Finally , there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility . Indeed , some call for a more dramatic and open ended escalation of our war effort one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade . I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost , and what we need to achieve to secure our interests . Furthermore , the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government . It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security , and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan . As President , I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility , our means , or our interests . And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces . I do not have the luxury of committing to just one . Indeed , I am mindful of the words of President Eisenhower , who in discussing our national security said , Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs . Over the past several years , we have lost that balance . We have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy . In the wake of an economic crisis , too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills . Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children . Meanwhile , competition within the global economy has grown more fierce . So we cannot simply afford to ignore the price of these wars . All told , by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars . Going forward , I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly . Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion for the military this year , and I will work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit . But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility , we must rebuild our strength here at home . Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power . It pays for our military . It underwrites our diplomacy . It taps the potential of our people , and allows investment in new industry . And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last . That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open ended because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own . Now , let me be clear None of this will be easy . The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly , and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan . It will be an enduring test of our free society , and our leadership in the world . And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century , our effort will involve disorderly regions , failed states , diffuse enemies . So as a result , America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict not just how we wage wars . We will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power . Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships . And we cannot count on military might alone . We have to invest in our homeland security , because we cannot capture or kill every violent extremist abroad . We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence , so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks . We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction . And that is why I have made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists , to stop the spread of nuclear weapons , and to pursue the goal of a world without them because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapons true security will come for those who reject them . We will have to use diplomacy , because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone . I have spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships . And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim world one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict , and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity . And finally , we must draw on the strength of our values for the challenges that we face may have changed , but the things that we believe in must not . That is why we must promote our values by living them at home which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay . And we must make it clear to every man , woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights , and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples . That is who we are . That is the source , the moral source , of America s authority . Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt , and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great grandparents , our country has borne a special burden in global affairs . We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents . We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies . We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings . We have not always been thanked for these efforts , and we have at times made mistakes . But more than any other nation , the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades a time that , for all its problems , has seen walls come down , and markets open , and billions lifted from poverty , unparalleled scientific progress and advancing frontiers of human liberty . For unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought world domination . Our union was founded in resistance to oppression . We do not seek to occupy other nations . We will not claim another nation s resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours . What we have fought for what we continue to fight for is a better future for our children and grandchildren . And we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity . As a country , we are not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Roosevelt was President . Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom . And now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age . In the end , our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms . It derives from our people from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries from the teachers that will educate our children , and the service of those who work in our communities at home from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people , by the people , and for the people a reality on this Earth . This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue nor should we . But I also know that we , as a country , cannot sustain our leadership , nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time , if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse . It is easy to forget that when this war began , we were united bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack , and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear . I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again . I believe with every fiber of my being that we as Americans can still come together behind a common purpose . For our values are not simply words written into parchment they are a creed that calls us together , and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation , as one people . America we are passing through a time of great trial . And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear that our cause is just , our resolve unwavering . We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might , and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer , a world that is more secure , and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes . Thank you . God bless you . May God bless the United States of America . Thank you very much . Thank you .<speech_sep>Madam Speaker , Vice President Biden , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Our Constitution declares that from time to time , the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our Union . For 220 years , our leaders have fulfilled this duty . They have done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility , and they have done so in the midst of war and depression , at moments of great strife and great struggle . It is tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable , that America was always destined to succeed . But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach , victory was very much in doubt . When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday , the future was anything but certain . These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our Union . And despite all our divisions and disagreements , our hesitations and our fears , America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation , as one people . Again , we are tested . And again , we must answer history s call . One year ago , I took office amid two wars , an economy rocked by a severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a Government deeply in debt . Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act , we might face a second depression . So we acted , immediately and aggressively . And 1 year later , the worst of the storm has passed . But the devastation remains . One in 10 Americans still cannot find work . Many businesses have shuttered . Home values have declined . Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard . And for those who d already known poverty , life s become that much harder . This recession has also compounded the burdens that America s families have been dealing with for decades the burden of working harder and longer for less , of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college . So I know the anxieties that are out there right now . They are not new . These struggles are the reason I ran for President . These struggles are what I have witnessed for years , in places like Elkhart , Indiana Galesburg , Illinois . I hear about them in the letters that I read each night . The toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home , asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work . For these Americans and so many others , change has not come fast enough . Some are frustrated , some are angry . They do not understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded , but hard work on Main Street is not , or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems . They are tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness . They know we cannot afford it . Not now . So we face big and difficult challenges . And what the American people hope , what they deserve , is for all of us , Democrats and Republicans , to work through our differences , to overcome the numbing weight of our politics . For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds , different stories , different beliefs , the anxieties they face are the same . The aspirations they hold are shared a job that pays the bills a chance to get ahead most of all , the ability to give their children a better life . And you know what else they share They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity . After one of the most difficult years in our history , they remain busy building cars and teaching kids , starting businesses and going back to school . They are coaching Little League and helping their neighbors . One woman wrote to me and said , We are strained but hopeful , struggling but encouraged . It is because of this spirit , this great decency and great strength , that I have never been more hopeful about America s future than I am tonight . Despite our hardships , our Union is strong . We do not give up . We do not quit . We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit . In this new decade , it is time the American people get a Government that matches their decency , that embodies their strength . And tonight I had like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise . It begins with our economy . Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis . It was not easy to do . And if there is one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between , it is that we all hated the bank bailout . I hated it . I hated it you hated it . It was about as popular as a root canal . But when I ran for President , I promised I would not just do what was popular I would do what was necessary . And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system , unemployment might be double what it is today . More businesses would certainly have closed . More homes would have surely been lost . So I supported the last administration s efforts to create the financial rescue program . And when we took that program over , we made it more transparent and more accountable . And as a result , the markets are now stabilized , and we have recovered most of the money we spent on the banks most but not all . To recover the rest , I have proposed a fee on the biggest banks . Now , I know Wall Street is not keen on this idea . But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again , they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need . Now , as we stabilized the financial system , we also took steps to get our economy growing again , save as many jobs as possible , and help Americans who had become unemployed . That is why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans , made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRand passed 25 different tax cuts . Now , let me repeat We cut taxes . We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families . We cut taxes for small businesses . We cut taxes for first time home buyers . We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children . We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college . I thought I had get some applause on that one . As a result , millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities , all of which helped businesses keep more workers . And we have not raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person not a single dime . Now , because of the steps we took , there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed . Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy . Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers . Tens of thousands are cops , firefighters , correctional officers , first responders . And we are on track to add another 1 frac12 million jobs to this total by the end of the year . The plan that has made all of this possible , from the tax cuts to the jobs , is the Recovery Act . That is right , the Recovery Act , also known as the stimulus bill . Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster . But you do not have to take their word for it . Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act . Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act , until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created . Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act , she would not be laid off after all . There are stories like this all across America . And after 2 years of recession , the economy is growing again . Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value . Businesses are beginning to invest again , and slowly some are starting to hire again . But I realize that for every success story , there are other stories , of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from , who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response . That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010 , and that is why I am calling for a new jobs bill tonight . Now , the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America s businesses . I agree , absolutely . But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers . We should start where most new jobs do , in small businesses , companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it is time she became her own boss . Through sheer grit and determination , these companies have weathered the recession , and they are ready to grow . But when you talk to small business owners in places like Allentown , Pennsylvania , or Elyria , Ohio , you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again , they are mostly lending to bigger companies . Financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country , even those that are making a profit . So tonight I am proposing that we take 30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat . I am also proposing a new small business tax credit , one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages . While we are at it , let us also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment . Next , we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow . From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System , our Nation has always been built to compete . There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products . Tomorrow I will visit Tampa , Florida , where workers will soon break ground on a new high speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act . There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation s goods , services , and information . We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient , which supports clean energy jobs . And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders , it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America . Now , the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps . As the first order of business this year , I urge the Senate to do the same , and I know they will . They will . People are out of work . They are hurting . They need our help . And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay . But the truth is , these steps will not make up for the 7 million jobs that we have lost over the last 2 years . The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problems that America s families have confronted for years . We cannot afford another so called economic expansion like the one from the last decade , what some call the lost decade , where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion , where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs , where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation . From the day I took office , I have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious . I have been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while . For those who make these claims , I have one simple question How long should we wait How long should America put its future on hold You see , Washington has been telling us to wait for decades , even as the problems have grown worse . Meanwhile , China s not waiting to revamp its economy . Germany s not waiting . India s not waiting . These nations are they are not standing still . These nations are not playing for second place . They are putting more emphasis on math and science . They are rebuilding their infrastructure . They are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs . Well , I do not accept second place for the United States of America . As hard as it may be , as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become , it is time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth . Now , one place to start is serious financial reform . Look , I am not interested in punishing banks . I am interested in protecting our economy . A strong , healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs . It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes . But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy . We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions . We cannot allow financial institutions , including those that take your deposits , to take risks that threaten the whole economy . Now , the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes , and the lobbyists are trying to kill it . But we cannot let them win this fight . And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform , I will send it back until we get it right . We have got to get it right . Next , we need to encourage American innovation . Last year , we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history , an investment that could lead to the world s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched . And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy . You can see the results of last year s investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1 , 200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels . But to create more of these clean energy jobs , we need more production , more efficiency , more incentives . And that means building a new generation of safe , clean nuclear powerplants in this country . It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development . It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies . And , yes , it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America . Now , I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year . And this year , I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate . I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy . I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change . But here s the thing Even if you doubt the evidence , providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future , because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy . And America must be that nation . Third , we need to export more of our goods , because the more products we make and sell to other countries , the more jobs we support right here in America . So tonight we set a new goal We will double our exports over the next 5 years , an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America . To help meet this goal , we are launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security . We have to seek new markets aggressively , just as our competitors are . If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals , we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores . But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules . And that is why we will continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia . Fourth , we need to invest in the skills and education of our people . Now , this year , we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools . And the idea here is simple Instead of rewarding failure , we only reward success . Instead of funding the status quo , we only invest in reform , reform that raises student achievement , inspires students to excel in math and science , and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans , from rural communities to the inner city . In the 21st century , the best antipoverty program around is a world class education . And in this country , the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential . When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States . Still , in this economy , a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job . That is why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges , which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families . To make college more affordable , this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans . Instead , let us take that money and give families a 10 , 000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants . And let us tell another 1 million students that when they graduate , they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they chose to go to college . And by the way , it is time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs , because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem . Now , the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class . That is why last year , I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families . That is why we are nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg . That is why we are working to lift the value of a family s single largest investment , their home . The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of 1 , 500 on mortgage payments . This year , we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages . And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform . Yes , we do . Now , let us clear a few things up . I did not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt . And by now it should be fairly obvious that I did not take on health care because it was good politics . I took on health care because of the stories I have heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage , patients who have been denied coverage , families , even those with insurance , who are just one illness away from financial ruin . After nearly a century of trying Democratic administrations , Republican administrations we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans . The approach we have taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry . It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market . It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care . And by the way , I want to acknowledge our First Lady , Michelle Obama , who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier . Thank you , honey . She gets embarrassed . Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan . It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses . And according to the Congressional Budget Office , the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress , our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as 1 trillion over the next two decades . Still , this is a complex issue , and the longer it was debated , the more skeptical people became . I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people . And I know that with all the lobbying and horse trading , the process left most Americans wondering , What is in it for me But I also know this problem is not going away . By the time I am finished speaking tonight , more Americans will have lost their health insurance . Millions will lose it this year . Our deficit will grow . Premiums will go up . Patients will be denied the care they need . Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether . I will not walk away from these Americans , and neither should the people in this Chamber . So , as temperatures cool , I want everyone to take another look at the plan we have proposed . There is a reason why many doctors , nurses , and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo . But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums , bring down the deficit , cover the uninsured , strengthen Medicare for seniors , and stop insurance company abuses , let me know . Let me know . Let me know . I am eager to see it . Here s what I ask Congress , though Do not walk away from reform . Not now . Not when we are so close . Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . Now , even as health care reform would reduce our deficit , it is not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves . It is a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that is been subject to a lot of political posturing . So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight . At the beginning of the last decade , the year 2000 , America had a budget surplus of over 200 billion . By the time I took office , we had a 1 year deficit of over 1 trillion and projected deficits of 8 trillion over the next decade . Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars , two tax cuts , and an expensive prescription drug program . On top of that , the effects of the recession put a 3 trillion hole in our budget . All this was before I walked in the door . Now just stating the facts . Now , if we had taken office in ordinary times , I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit . But we took office amid a crisis . And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another 1 trillion to our national debt . That too is a fact . I am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do . But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions . The Federal Government should do the same . So tonight I am proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year . Starting in 2011 , we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years . Spending related to our national security , Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security will not be affected . But all other discretionary Government programs will . Like any cash strapped family , we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we do not . And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto , I will . We will continue to go through the budget , line by line , page by page , to eliminate programs that we cannot afford and do not work . We have already identified 20 billion in savings for next year . To help working families , we will extend our middle class tax cuts . But at a time of record deficits , we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies , for investment fund managers , and for those making over 250 , 000 a year . We just cannot afford it . Now , even after paying for what we spent on my watch , we will still face the massive deficit we had when I took office . More importantly , the cost of Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security will continue to skyrocket . That is why I have called for a bipartisan fiscal commission , modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad . This cannot be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem . The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline . Now , yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission , so I will issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward , because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans . And when the vote comes tomorrow , the Senate should restore the pay as you go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s . Now , I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting . And I agree , which is why this freeze will not take effect until next year , when the economy is stronger . That is how budgeting works . But understand , if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our debt , it could damage our markets , increase the cost of borrowing , and jeopardize our recovery , all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes . From some on the right , I expect we will hear a different argument , that if we just make fewer investments in our people , extend tax cuts , including those for the wealthier Americans , eliminate more regulations , maintain the status quo on health care , our deficits will go away . The problem is , that is what we did for 8 years . That is what helped us into this crisis . It is what helped lead to these deficits . We cannot do it again . Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades , it is time to try something new . Let us invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt . Let us meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here . Let us try common sense a novel concept . Now , to do that , we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now . We face a deficit of trust , deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years . To close that credibility gap , we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists , to do our work openly , to give our people the Government they deserve . Now , that is what I came to Washington to do . That is why , for the first time in history , my administration posts on our White House visitors online . That is why we have excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions . But we cannot stop there . It is time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client , with my administration or with Congress . It is time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office . With all due deference to separation of powers , last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations , to spend without limit in our elections . I do not think American elections should be bankrolled by America s most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities . They should be decided by the American people . And I had urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems . I am also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform , Democrats and Republicans Democrats and Republicans . Look , you have trimmed some of this spending , you have embraced some meaningful change , but restoring the public trust demands more . For example , some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online . Tonight I am calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there is a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent . Of course , none of these reforms will even happen if we do not also reform how we work with one another . Now , I am not naive . I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some postpartisan era . I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched . And on some issues , there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways . These disagreements , about the role of government in our lives , about our national priorities and our national security , they have been taking place for over 200 years . They are the very essence of our democracy . But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day . We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side , a belief that if you lose , I win . Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can . The confirmation of I am speaking to both parties now . The confirmation of well qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators . Washington may think that saying anything about the other side , no matter how false , no matter how malicious , is just part of the game . But it is precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people . Worse yet , it is sowing further division among our citizens , further distrust in our Government . So , no , I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics . I know it is an election year . And after last week , it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual . But we still need to govern . To Democrats , I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems , not run for the hills . And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town a supermajority then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well . Just saying no to everything may be good short term politics , but it is not leadership . We were sent here to serve our citizens , not our ambitions . So let us show the American people that we can do it together . This week , I will be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans . I had like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership . I know you cannot wait . Now , throughout our history , no issue has united this country more than our security . Sadly , some of the unity we felt after 9 11 has dissipated . And we can argue all we want about who is to blame for this , but I am not interested in relitigating the past . I know that all of us love this country . All of us are committed to its defense . So let us put aside the schoolyard taunts about who is tough . Let us reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values . Let us leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our Nation and forge a more hopeful future for America and for the world . That is the work we began last year . Since the day I took office , we have renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation . We have made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives . We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack , with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence . We have prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula . And in the last year , hundreds of Al Qaida s fighters and affiliates , including many senior leaders , have been captured or killed , far more than in 2008 . And in Afghanistan , we are increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home . We will reward good governance , work to reduce corruption , and support the rights of all Afghans , men and women alike . We are joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose . There will be difficult days ahead , but I am absolutely confident we will succeed . As we take the fight to Al Qaida , we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people . As a candidate , I promised that I would end this war , and that is what I am doing as President . We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August . We will support the Iraqi Government as they hold elections , and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity . But make no mistake This war is ending , and all of our troops are coming home . Tonight all of our men and women in uniform , in Iraq , in Afghanistan , and around the world , they have to know that we that they have our respect , our gratitude , our full support . And just as they must have the resources they need in war , we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home . That is why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year . That is why we are building a 21st century VAnd that is why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families . Now , even as we prosecute two wars , we are also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people , the threat of nuclear weapons . I have embraced the vision of John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them . To reduce our stockpiles and launchers , while ensuring our deterrent , the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades . And at April s Nuclear Security Summit , we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington , Dbehind a clear goal securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists . Now , these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons . That is why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions , sanctions that are being vigorously enforced . That is why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated . And as Iran s leaders continue to ignore their obligations , there should be no doubt They too will face growing consequences . That is a promise . That is the leadership we are providing engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people . We are working through the G 20 to sustain a lasting global recovery . We are working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation . We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change . We are helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV AIDAnd we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease , a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad . As we have for over 60 years , America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores . But we also do it because it is right . That is why , as we meet here tonight , over 10 , 000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild . That is why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan , why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran , why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea . For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity always . Abroad , America s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals . The same is true at home . We find unity in our incredible diversity , drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution The notion that we are all created equal that no matter who you are or what you look like , if you abide by the law , you should be protected by it if you adhere to our common values , you should be treated no different than anyone else . We must continually renew this promise . My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination . We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate . This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are . It is the right thing to do . We are going to crackdown on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal day s work . And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system , to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our Nation . In the end , it is our ideals , our values that built America , values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe , values that drive our citizens still . Every day , Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers . Time and again , they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country . They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit . These are not Republican values or Democratic values that they are living by , business values or labor values , they are American values . Unfortunately , too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions our corporations , our media , and , yes , our Government still reflect these same values . Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper . But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain , people s doubts grow . Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up , we lose faith . The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments , big issues into sound bites , our citizens turn away . No wonder there is so much cynicism out there . No wonder there is so much disappointment . I campaigned on the promise of change . Change we can believe in , the slogan went . And right now I know there are many Americans who are not sure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it . But remember this I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone . Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated . And when you try to do big things and make big changes , it stirs passions and controversy . That is just how it is . Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers . We can do what is necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election , instead of doing what is best for the next generation . But I also know this If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago , we would not be here tonight . The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard , to do what was needed even when success was uncertain , to do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their children and their grandchildren . Now , our administration has had some political setbacks this year , and some of them were deserved . But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year . And what keeps me going , what keeps me fighting , is that despite all these setbacks , that spirit of determination and optimism , that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people , that lives on . It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company , None of us , he said , . . . are willing to consider , even slightly , that we might fail . It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession , We are strong . We are resilient . We are American . It lives on in the 8 year old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti . And it lives on in all the Americans who have dropped everything to go someplace they have never been and pull people they have never known from the rubble , prompting chants of S . A . S . A . S . A when another life was saved . The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries lives on in you , its people . We have finished a difficult year . We have come through a difficult decade . But a new year has come . A new decade stretches before us . We do not quit . I do not quit . Let us seize this moment to start anew , to carry the dream forward , and to strengthen our Union once more . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . Everybody , please have a seat . Thank you very much . Well , thank you . It is good to be back . It is good to be back in New York , it is good to be back in the Great Hall at Cooper Union . We have got some special guests here that I want to acknowledge . Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is here in the house . Governor David Paterson is here . Attorney General Andrew Cuomo . State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is here . The Mayor of New York City , Michael Bloomberg . Dr . George Campbell , Jr . , president of Cooper Union . And all the citywide elected officials who are here . Thank you very much for your attendance . It is wonderful to be back in Cooper Union , where generations of leaders and citizens have come to defend their ideas and contest their differences . It is also good to be back in Lower Manhattan , a few blocks from Wall Street . It really is good to be back , because Wall Street is the heart of our nation s financial sector . Now , since I last spoke here two years ago , our country has been through a terrible trial . More than 8 million people have lost their jobs . Countless small businesses have had to shut their doors . Trillions of dollars in savings have been lost forcing seniors to put off retirement , young people to postpone college , entrepreneurs to give up on the dream of starting a company . And as a nation we were forced to take unprecedented steps to rescue the financial system and the broader economy . And as a result of the decisions we made some of which , let us face it , were very unpopular we are seeing hopeful signs . A little more than one year ago we were losing an average of 750 , 000 jobs each month . Today , America is adding jobs again . One year ago the economy was shrinking rapidly . Today the economy is growing . In fact , we have seen the fastest turnaround in growth in nearly three decades . But you are here and I am here because we have got more work to do . Until this progress is felt not just on Wall Street but on Main Street we cannot be satisfied . Until the millions of our neighbors who are looking for work can find a job , and wages are growing at a meaningful pace , we may be able to claim a technical recovery but we will not have truly recovered . And even as we seek to revive this economy , it is also incumbent on us to rebuild it stronger than before . We do not want an economy that has the same weaknesses that led to this crisis . And that means addressing some of the underlying problems that led to this turmoil and devastation in the first place . Now , one of the most significant contributors to this recession was a financial crisis as dire as any we have known in generations at least since the 30s . And that crisis was born of a failure of responsibility from Wall Street all the way to Washington that brought down many of the world s largest financial firms and nearly dragged our economy into a second Great Depression . It was that failure of responsibility that I spoke about when I came to New York more than two years ago before the worst of the crisis had unfolded . It was back in 2007 . And I take no satisfaction in noting that my comments then have largely been borne out by the events that followed . But I repeat what I said then because it is essential that we learn the lessons from this crisis so we do not doom ourselves to repeat it . And make no mistake , that is exactly what will happen if we allow this moment to pass and that is an outcome that is unacceptable to me and it is unacceptable to you , the American people . As I said on this stage two years ago , I believe in the power of the free market . I believe in a strong financial sector that helps people to raise capital and get loans and invest their savings . That is part of what has made America what it is . But a free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it . That is what happened too often in the years leading up to this crisis . Some and let me be clear , not all but some on Wall Street forgot that behind every dollar traded or leveraged there is family looking to buy a house , or pay for an education , open a business , save for retirement . What happens on Wall Street has real consequences across the country , across our economy . I have spoken before about the need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the 21st century . And given the importance of the financial sector , Wall Street reform is an absolutely essential part of that foundation . Without it , our house will continue to sit on shifting sands , and our families , businesses , and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crises . That is why I feel so strongly that we need to enact a set of updated , commonsense rules to ensure accountability on Wall Street and to protect consumers in our financial system . Now , here s the good news A comprehensive plan to achieve these reforms has already passed the House of Representatives . A Senate version is currently being debated , drawing on ideas from Democrats and Republicans . Both bills represent significant improvement on the flawed rules that we have in place today , despite the furious effort of industry lobbyists to shape this legislation to their special interests . And for those of you in the financial sector I am sure that some of these lobbyists work for you and they are doing what they are being paid to do . But I am here today specifically when I speak to the titans of industry here because I want to urge you to join us , instead of fighting us in this effort . I am here because I believe that these reforms are , in the end , not only in the best interest of our country , but in the best interest of the financial sector . And I am here to explain what reform will look like , and why it matters . Now , first , the bill being considered in the Senate would create what we did not have before , and that is a way to protect the financial system and the broader economy and American taxpayers in the event that a large financial firm begins to fail . If there is a Lehmans or an AIhow can we respond in a way that does not force taxpayers to pick up the tab or , alternatively , could bring down the whole system . In an ordinary local bank when it approaches insolvency , we have got a process , an orderly process through the FDIthat ensures that depositors are protected , maintains confidence in the banking system , and it works . Customers and taxpayers are protected and owners and management lose their equity . But we do not have that kind of process designed to contain the failure of a Lehman Brothers or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country . That is why , when this crisis began , crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world s biggest companies companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets had to take place in hurried discussions in the middle of the night . And that is why , to save the entire economy from an even worse catastrophe , we had to deploy taxpayer dollars . Now , much of that money has now been paid back and my administration has proposed a fee to be paid by large financial firms to recover all the money , every dime , because the American people should never have been put in that position in the first place . But this is why we need a system to shut these firms down with the least amount of collateral damage to innocent people and innocent businesses . And from the start , I have insisted that the financial industry , not taxpayers , shoulder the costs in the event that a large financial company should falter . The goal is to make certain that taxpayers are never again on the hook because a firm is deemed too big to fail . Now , there is a legitimate debate taking place about how best to ensure taxpayers are held harmless in this process . And that is a legitimate debate , and I encourage that debate . But what is not legitimate is to suggest that somehow the legislation being proposed is going to encourage future taxpayer bailouts , as some have claimed . That makes for a good sound bite , but it is not factually accurate . It is not true . In fact , the system as it stands the system as it stands is what led to a series of massive , costly taxpayer bailouts . And it is only with reform that we can avoid a similar outcome in the future . In other words , a vote for reform is a vote to put a stop to taxpayer funded bailouts . That is the truth . End of story . And nobody should be fooled in this debate . By the way , these changes have the added benefit of creating incentives within the industry to ensure that no one company can ever threaten to bring down the whole economy . To that end , the bill would also enact what is known as the Volcker Rule and there is a tall guy sitting in the front row here , Paul Volcker who we named it after . And it does something very simple It places some limits on the size of banks and the kinds of risks that banking institutions can take . This will not only safeguard our system against crises , this will also make our system stronger and more competitive by instilling confidence here at home and across the globe . Markets depend on that confidence . Part of what led to the turmoil of the past two years was that in the absence of clear rules and sound practices , people did not trust that our system was one in which it was safe to invest or lend . As we have seen , that harms all of us . So by enacting these reforms , we will help ensure that our financial system and our economy continues to be the envy of the world . That is the first thing , making sure that we can wind down one firm if it gets into trouble without bringing the whole system down or forcing taxpayers to fund a bailout . Number two , reform would bring new transparency to many financial markets . As you know , part of what led to this crisis was firms like AIG and others who were making huge and risky bets , using derivatives and other complicated financial instruments , in ways that defied accountability , or even common sense . In fact , many practices were so opaque , so confusing , so complex that the people inside the firms did not understand them , much less those who were charged with overseeing them . They were not fully aware of the massive bets that were being placed . That is what led Warren Buffett to describe derivatives that were bought and sold with little oversight as financial weapons of mass destruction . That is what he called them . And that is why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these kinds of transactions take place in the light of day . Now , there is been a great deal of concern about these changes . So I want to reiterate There is a legitimate role for these financial instruments in our economy . They can help allay risk and spur investment . And there are a lot of companies that use these instruments to that legitimate end they are managing exposure to fluctuating prices or currencies , fluctuating markets . For example , a business might hedge against rising oil prices by buying a financial product to secure stable fuel costs , so an airlines might have an interest in locking in a decent price . That is how markets are supposed to work . The problem is these markets operated in the shadows of our economy , invisible to regulators , invisible to the public . So reckless practices were rampant . Risks accrued until they threatened our entire financial system . And that is why these reforms are designed to respect legitimate activities but prevent reckless risk taking . That is why we want to ensure that financial products like standardized derivatives are traded out in the open , in the full view of businesses , investors , and those charged with oversight . And I was encouraged to see a Republican senator join with Democrats this week in moving forward on this issue . That is a good sign . That is a good sign . For without action , we will continue to see what amounts to highly leveraged , loosely monitored gambling in our financial system , putting taxpayers and the economy in jeopardy . And the only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that we are proposing are those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny . Third , this plan would enact the strongest consumer financial protections ever . And that is absolutely necessary because this financial crisis was not just the result of decisions made in the executive suites on Wall Street it was also the result of decisions made around kitchen tables across America , by folks who took on mortgages and credit cards and auto loans . And while it is true that many Americans took on financial obligations that they knew or should have known they could not have afforded , millions of others were , frankly , duped . They were misled by deceptive terms and conditions , buried deep in the fine print . And while a few companies made out like bandits by exploiting their customers , our entire economy was made more vulnerable . Millions of people have now lost their homes . Tens of millions more have lost value in their homes . Just about every sector of our economy has felt the pain , whether you are paving driveways in Arizona , or selling houses in Ohio , or you are doing home repairs in California , or you are using your home equity to start a small business in Florida . That is why we need to give consumers more protection and more power in our financial system . This is not about stifling competition , stifling innovation it is just the opposite . With a dedicated agency setting ground rules and looking out for ordinary people in our financial system , we will empower consumers with clear and concise information when they are making financial decisions . So instead of competing to offer confusing products , companies will compete the old fashioned way , by offering better products . And that will mean more choices for consumers , more opportunities for businesses , and more stability in our financial system . And unless your business model depends on bilking people , there is little to fear from these new rules . Number four , the last key component of reform . These Wall Street reforms will give shareholders new power in the financial system . They will get what we call a say on pay , a voice with respect to the salaries and bonuses awarded to top executives . And the SEC will have the authority to give shareholders more say in corporate elections , so that investors and pension holders have a stronger role in determining who manages the company in which they have placed their savings . Now , Americans do not begrudge anybody for success when that success is earned . But when we read in the past , and sometimes in the present , about enormous executive bonuses at firms even as they are relying on assistance from taxpayers or they are taking huge risks that threaten the system as a whole or their company is doing badly it offends our fundamental values . Not only that , some of the salaries and bonuses that we have seen creates perverse incentives to take reckless risks that contributed to the crisis . It is what helped lead to a relentless focus on a company s next quarter , to the detriment of its next year or its next decade . And it led to a situation in which folks with the most to lose stock and pension holders had the least to say in the process . And that has to change . Let me close by saying this . I have laid out a set of Wall Street reforms . These are reforms that would put an end to taxpayer bailouts that would bring complex financial dealings out of the shadows that would protect consumers and that would give shareholders more power in the financial system . But let us face it , we also need reform in Washington . And the debate the debate over these changes is a perfect example . I mean , we have seen battalions of financial industry lobbyists descending on Capitol Hill , firms spending millions to influence the outcome of this debate . We have seen misleading arguments and attacks that are designed not to improve the bill but to weaken or to kill it . We have seen a bipartisan process buckle under the weight of these withering forces , even as we have produced a proposal that by all accounts is a commonsense , reasonable , non ideological approach to target the root problems that led to the turmoil in our financial sector and ultimately in our entire economy . So we have seen business as usual in Washington , but I believe we can and must put this kind of cynical politics aside . We have got to put an end to it . That is why I am here today . That is why I am here today . And to those of you who are in the financial sector , let me say this , we will not always see eye to eye . We will not always agree . But that does not mean that we have got to choose between two extremes . We do not have to choose between markets that are unfettered by even modest protections against crisis , or markets that are stymied by onerous rules that suppress enterprise and innovation . That is a false choice . And we need no more proof than the crisis that we have just been through . You see , there has always been a tension between the desire to allow markets to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rules to prevent markets from falling out of kilter . But managing that tension , one that we have debated since the founding of this nation , is what has allowed our country to keep up with a changing world . For in taking up this debate , in figuring out how to apply well worn principles with each new age , we ensure that we do not tip too far one way or the other that our democracy remains as dynamic and our economy remains as dynamic as it has in the past . So , yes , this debate can be contentious . It can be heated . But in the end it serves only to make our country stronger . It has allowed us to adapt and to thrive . And I read a report recently that I think fairly illustrates this point . It is from Time Magazine . I am going to quote Through the great banking houses of Manhattan last week ran wild eyed alarm . Big bankers stared at one another in anger and astonishment . A bill just passed hellip would rivet upon their institutions what they considered a monstrous system hellip such a system , they felt , would not only rob them of their pride of profession but would reduce all banking to its lowest level . That appeared in Time Magazine in June of 1933 . The system that caused so much consternation , so much concern was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , also known as the FDIan institution that has successfully secured the deposits of generations of Americans . In the end , our system only works our markets are only free when there are basic safeguards that prevent abuse , that check excesses , that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system . And that is what the reforms we have been proposing are designed to achieve no more , no less . And because that is how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers , that it works for investors , and that it works for financial institutions in other words , that it works for all of us that is why we are working so hard to get this stuff passed . This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history . It is what I said when I spoke here two years ago . Because ultimately , there is no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street . We will rise or we will fall together as one nation . And that is why I urge all of you to join me . I urge all of you to join me , to join those who are seeking to pass these commonsense reforms . And for those of you in the financial industry , I urge you to join me not only because it is in the interest of your industry , but also because it is in the interest of your country . Thank you so much . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>Hello , everybody . I am glad to see that all of you braved the weather to be here . A little while ago I had a meeting with the Democratic and Republican congressional leaders , and it went very well . In fact , I understand that McConnell and Reid are out doing snow angels on the South Lawn together . Can you picture that , Chuck Not really The meeting did go well , and I appreciate them making the trek . We had a good and frank conversation and it is one that I hope we can continue on a more regular basis . We all understand that there are legitimate and genuine differences between the parties , but despite the political posturing that often paralyzes this town , there are many issues upon which we can and should agree . That is what the American people are demanding of us . I think they are tired of every day being Election Day in Washington . And at this critical time in our country , the people sent us here expect a seriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics . That is why I am going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as we work to tackle the pressing challenges ahead . I am confident , for example , that when one in 10 of our fellow citizens cannot work , we should be able to come together and help business create more jobs . We ought to be able to agree on providing small businesses with additional tax credits and much needed lines of credit . We ought to agree on investments in crumbling roads and bridges , and we should agree on tax breaks for making homes more energy efficient all of which will put more Americans to work . Many of the job proposals that I have laid out have passed the House and are soon going to be debated in the Senate . We spent a lot of time in this meeting discussing a jobs package and how we could move forward on that . And if there are additional ideas , I will consider them as well . What I will not consider is doing nothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country . We also talked about restoring fiscal responsibility . There are few matters on which there is as much vigorous bipartisan agreement , at least in public , but unfortunately there is also a lot of partisan wrangling behind closed doors . This is what we know for sure For us to solve this extraordinary problem that is so many years in the making , it is going to take the cooperation of both parties . It is not going to happen in any other way . I am pleased that Congress supported my request to restore the pay as you go rule , which was instrumental in turning deficits into surpluses during the 1990s . I have also called for a bipartisan fiscal commission . Unfortunately this measure , which originally had received the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate and was cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Gregg , Democrats and Republicans , was blocked there . So I am going to be creating this commission by executive order . And during our meeting I asked the leadership of both parties to join in this serious effort to address our long term deficits , because when the politics is put aside , the reality of our fiscal challenge is not subject to interpretation . Math is not partisan . There ought to be a debate about how to close our deficits . What we cannot accept is business as usual , and we cannot afford grandstanding at the expense of actually getting something done . During our meeting we also touched briefly on how we can move forward on health reform . I have already announced that in two weeks I will be holding a meeting with people from both parties , and as I told the congressional leadership , I am looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measured against this test . Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the federal government , which spends a huge amount on health care Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by the insurance industry Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of working Americans who do not have it right now And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability We also talked about why this is so urgent . Just this week , there was a report that Anthem Blue Cross , which is the largest insurer in the largest state , California , is planning on raising premiums for many individual policyholders by as much as 39 percent . If we do not act , this is just a preview of coming attractions . Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance millions more will lose their coverage altogether our deficits will continue to grow larger . And we have an obligation both parties to tackle this issue in a serious way . Now , bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside matters of party for the good of the country . I will not hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friends in the minority party , but I also will not hesitate to condemn what I consider to be obstinacy that is rooted not in substantive disagreements but in political expedience . We talked about this as well , particularly when it comes to the confirmation process . I respect the Senate s role to advise and consent , but for months , qualified , non controversial nominees for critical positions in government , often positions related to our national security , have been held up despite having overwhelming support . My nominee for one important job , the head of General Services Administration , which helps run the government , was denied a vote for nine months . When she finally got a vote on her nomination , she was confirmed 96 to nothing . That is not advise and consent that is delay and obstruct . One senator , as you all are aware , had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmarks in his state . In our meeting , I asked the congressional leadership to put a stop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months . Surely we can set aside partisanship and do what is traditionally been done to confirm these nominations . If the Senate does not act and I made this very clear if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees , I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess , because we cannot afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well functioning government . My hope is that this will be the first of a series of meetings that I have with leadership of both parties in Congress . We have got to get past the tired debates that have plagued our politics and left behind nothing but soaring debt and mounting challenges , greater hardships among the American people , and extraordinary frustrations among the American people . Those frustrations are what led me to run for President , and as long as I am here in Washington , I intend to try to make this government work on their behalf . So , you know , I am going to take a couple of questions , guys . Major . Well , here s how I responded to John in the meeting , and I have said this publicly before . There are some core goals that have to be met . We have got to control costs , both for families and businesses , but also for our government . Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledge that the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending . We cannot deal with our deficits and debt long term unless we get a handle on that . So that has to be part of a package . Number two , we have got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who have got health insurance . And number three , we have got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individual market , as I just mentioned , in California , who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent . That applies to the majority of small businesses , as well as sole proprietors . They are struggling . So I have got these goals . Now , we have a package , as we work through the differences between the House and the Senate , and we will put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time , that meets those criteria , meets those goals . But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans , they indicated , we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost . And I said , great , let me see it . And I have no interest in doing something that is more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way to do it . So I am going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote these goals . What I will not do , what I do not think makes sense and I do not think the American people want to see , would be another year of partisan wrangling around these issues another six months or eight months or nine months worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there is a lot of posturing . Let us get the relevant parties together let us put the best ideas on the table . My hope is that we can find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward , even if I do not get every single thing that I want . But here s the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell Bipartisanship cannot be that I agree to all the things that they believe in or want , and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want , and that is the price of bipartisanship , right But that is sometimes the way it gets presented . Mitch McConnell said something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coal technology and more drilling to increase oil production . Well , of course he likes that that is part of the Republican agenda for energy , which I accept . And I am willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway . But there is got to be some give from their side as well . That is true on health care that is true on energy that is true on financial reform . That is what I am hoping gets accomplished at the summit . What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over the last year . I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills . I think it is important for all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we are moving forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care , that there is complete transparency and all of these issues have been adequately vetted and adequately debated . And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here s what we think we should do , but it also gives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here s our plan here s why we think this will work . And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they did not think that the status quo was acceptable , and that is , right there , promising . That indicates that if all sides agree that we cannot just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done . Well , I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression and people were not sure whether the financial system was going to melt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession . So let us be clear about the sources of uncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years A huge contraction , trillions of dollars of losses in people s 401s people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that they still have not worked out the housing market losing a whole bunch of value . So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6 percent . The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments , and I anticipate that they are going to start hiring at a more rapid clip . What I have also heard is them saying that we would like to feel like Washington is working and able to get some things done . There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty . One way would be to say , well , you know what , we will just go back to what we were doing before on , let us say , the financial markets . We will not have the regulations that we need we will not make any changes in terms of too big to fail . That will provide certainty until the next financial crisis . That is not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need . The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets so that we do not have banks that are too big to fail that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts . That requires legislation . The sooner we can get that done , the better . The same would be true when it comes to health care . A lot of CEOs I hear from will say , boy , we had like you to get health care settled one way or another , but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent , that is the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment . So I guess my answer would be this The sooner the business community has a sense that we have got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big , serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling , I think the better off the entire country is going to be . I absolutely agree on that . What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform , for example , to say , boy , we had be doing fine if we just did not try to regulate the banks . That I think would be a mistake . The small businesses I talk to and I have been talking to a lot of them as I have been traveling around the country over the last several months their biggest problem is right now they cannot get credit out of their banks so they are uncertain about that . And they are still uncertain about orders do they just have enough customers to justify them doing more . It is looking better at this point . But that is not the rationale for people saying , I am not hiring . Let me put it this way . Most small businesses right now , if they have got enough customers to make a profit and they can get the bank loans required to boost their payroll , boost their inventory , and sell to those customers , they will do so . Okay Let us see , let us get a print guy here . David . You know , I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach . What do I mean by that I am very firm in my conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal that country is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy . So we have to move in that direction . What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth , produce jobs , make sure our businesses are competitive around the world , that we are going to need some of the old , traditional energy sources as we are developing these new ones and ramping them up . So we cannot overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy . That just cannot happen . We are going to have needs in these traditional sources . And so the question then is , are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe , secure nuclear power that includes new technologies so that we can use coal which we have in abundance and is very cheap , but often is adding to our greenhouse gases can we find sequestration technologies that clean that up can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that is environmentally sustainable And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy . And my hope is that my Republican friends , but also Democrats , say to themselves , let us be practical and let us do both . Let us not just do one or the other let us do both . Over time I think the transition is going to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix . But we have got to do both . I am just a eternal optimist and so it is the right thing to do . And all I can do is just to keep on making the argument about what is right for the country and assume that over time people , regardless of party , regardless of their particular political positions , are going to gravitate towards the truth . Okay I am going to take two more . Let us see Well , I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here , so go ahead , Chuck . Why is everybody moaning about Todd Well , it is moving along fairly quickly . I think that we have bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can align themselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community . The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide the conversion of some of the low enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need for their medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens . They rejected it although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it is not always clear who is speaking on behalf of the government , and we get a lot of different , mixed signals . But what is clear is , is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia , China , Germany , France , Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal , and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept . That indicates to us that , despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization . And that is not acceptable to the international community , not just to the United States . So what we have said from the start was we are moving on dual tracks . If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead you down a path of being a member of good standing , then we welcome you . If not Well , I am getting to that . And if not , then the next step is sanctions . They have made their choice so far , although the door is still open . And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks is developing a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from the international community as a whole . Well , meaning that there is going to be a We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran that their approach is unacceptable . And the will be one aspect of that broader effort . Well , the we are confident right now that the international community is unified around Iran s misbehavior in this area . How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctions is something that we are going to have to see . One thing I am pleased about is to see how forward leaning the Russians have been on this issue . I think they clearly have seen that Iran has not been serious about solving what is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community . All right I am going to make this the last question . And I will take somebody from the back yes . Yes . On health care , the Republicans are asking whether the February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting your side , or will it just be the members of Congress And on Anthem Blue Cross , do you have the authority to go in and tell a private company they cannot charge that how will you stop them Well , I do not have the authority as I understand it I cannot simply issue an executive order lowering everybody s rates . If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of grief on Capitol Hill . That is why reform is so important . That is why the status quo is unacceptable . But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue . I know the American people get frustrated in debating something like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by different groups and different interests . It is a big , complicated , tough issue . But what is also true is that without some action on the part of Congress , it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the current trajectory . And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 percent . The current trajectory is more and more people are losing health care . I do not know if people noted , because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President is trying to take over a government takeover of health care . I do not know if anybody noticed that for the first time this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the private sector not because of anything we did , but because more and more people are losing their health care from their employers . It is becoming unaffordable . That is what we are trying to prevent . We want people to be able to get health care from their employers . But we also understand that you have got to fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to give their employees insurance at an affordable rate . And that is not happening right now . To your question about the 25th , my hope is that this does not end up being political theater , as I think some of you have phrased it . I want a substantive discussion . We have not refined exactly how the agenda is going to go that day . We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what they think would be most useful . I do want to make sure that there is some people like the Congressional Budget Office , for example , that are considered non partisan , who can answer questions . In this whole health care debate I am reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan , who was I guess in an argument with one of his colleagues , and his colleague was losing the argument so he got a little flustered and said to Senator Moynihan , Well , I am entitled to my own opinion . And Senator Moynihan said , Well , you are entitled to your own opinion , but you are not entitled to your own facts . I think that is the key to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care . Let us establish some common facts . Let us establish what the issues are , what the problems are , and let us test out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas do not . And if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approaches would work , then I think we can make some progress . And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable . So if it is established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those costs , I have said from the beginning of this debate I had be willing to work on that . On the other hand , if I am told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs , then I am also going to insist , okay , let us look at that as one aspect of it , but what else are we willing to do And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier . Bipartisanship cannot mean simply that Democrats give up everything that they believe in , find the handful of things that Republicans have been advocating for and we do those things , and then we have bipartisanship . That is not how it works in any other realm of life . That is certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle , although I usually do give in most of the time . But the there is got to be some give and take , and that is what I am hoping can be accomplished . And I am confident that is what the American people are looking for . So , all right Okay , since there was not a jobs question I will make this the last one , jobs question . Well , my understanding is first of all , the House has moved forward a jobs package that has some good elements in it . My understanding is , is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as we speak on the Senate side about some elements of a package . I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on . Just to give you an example , the idea of eliminating capital gains for small businesses something we can all agree on . I talked about it at the State of the Union address . My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community banks who are lending to small businesses more capital , because that is something that I keep on hearing is one of the biggest problems that small businesses have out there . So I think that it is realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I think need to be done , and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package and so forth . It may take a series of incremental steps , but the one thing I am absolutely clear about is , is that we have got an economy that is growing right now , a huge boost in productivity that is the good news . The bad news is , is that companies still have not taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full time . We are seeing an increase in temporary workers , but they have not yet taken on that full time worker . And so providing some additional impetus to them , right as the economy is moving in a positive direction , I think can end up yielding some good results . All right Thank you , guys . That was pretty good , thanks .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you very much . Please , please be seated . To the families of those we have lost to all who called them friends to the students of this university , the public servants who are gathered here , the people of Tucson and the people of Arizona I have come here tonight as an American who , like all Americans , kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow . There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts . But know this The hopes of a nation are here tonight . We mourn with you for the fallen . We join you in your grief . And we add our faith to yours that Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other living victims of this tragedy will pull through . Scripture tells us There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God , the holy place where the Most High dwells . God is within her , she will not fall God will help her at break of day . On Saturday morning , Gabby , her staff and many of her constituents gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech . They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents , so as to carry their concerns back to our nation s capital . Gabby called it Congress on Your Corner just an updated version of government of and by and for the people . And that quintessentially American scene , that was the scene that was shattered by a gunman s bullets . And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday they , too , represented what is best in us , what is best in America . Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years . A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago appointed by President George Bush and rose to become Arizona s chief federal judge . His colleagues described him as the hardest working judge within the Ninth Circuit . He was on his way back from attending Mass , as he did every day , when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative . John is survived by his loving wife , Maureen , his three sons and his five beautiful grandchildren . George and Dorothy Morris Dot to her friends were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters . They did everything together traveling the open road in their Renjoying what their friends called a 50 year honeymoon . Saturday morning , they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say . When gunfire rang out , George , a former Marine , instinctively tried to shield his wife . Both were shot . Dot passed away . A New Jersey native , Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow . But in the summer , she would return East , where her world revolved around her three children , her seven grandchildren and 2 year old great granddaughter . A gifted quilter , she had often work under a favorite tree , or sometimes she had sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants to give out at the church where she volunteered . A Republican , she took a liking to Gabby , and wanted to get to know her better . Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together about 70 years ago . They moved apart and started their own respective families . But after both were widowed they found their way back here , to , as one of Mavy s daughters put it , be boyfriend and girlfriend again . When they were not out on the road in their motor home , you could find them just up the road , helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ . A retired construction worker , Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with his dog , Tux . His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife , sacrificing his life for hers . Everything everything Gabe Zimmerman did , he did with passion . But his true passion was helping people . As Gabby s outreach director , he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own , seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned , that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved , that government was working for ordinary folks . He died doing what he loved talking with people and seeing how he could help . And Gabe is survived by his parents , Ross and Emily , his brother , Ben , and his fianc eacute e , Kelly , who he planned to marry next year . And then there is nine year old Christina Taylor Green . Christina was an A student she was a dancer she was a gymnast she was a swimmer . She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues , and as the only girl on her Little League team , no one put it past her . She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age . She had remind her mother , We are so blessed . We have the best life . And she had pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate . Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing . Our hearts are broken and yet , our hearts also have reason for fullness . Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting , including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday . I have just come from the University Medical Center , just a mile from here , where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak . And I want to tell you her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you right after we went to visit , a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room , Gabby opened her eyes for the first time . Gabby opened her eyes for the first time . Gabby opened her eyes . Gabby opened her eyes , so I can tell you she knows we are here . She knows we love her . And she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey . We are there for her . Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news , and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others . We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez a volunteer in Gabby s office . And , Daniel , I am sorry , you may deny it , but we have decided you are a hero because you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss , and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive . We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload . Right over there . We are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch , who wrestled away the killer s ammunition , and undoubtedly saved some lives . And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal those who d been hurt . We are grateful to them . These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle . They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength . Heroism is here , in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens , all around us , just waiting to be summoned as it was on Saturday morning . Their actions , their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us . It raises a question of what , beyond prayers and expressions of concern , is required of us going forward . How can we honor the fallen How can we be true to their memory You see , when a tragedy like this strikes , it is part of our nature to demand explanations to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless . Already we have seen a national conversation commence , not only about the motivations behind these killings , but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system . And much of this process , of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future , is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self government . But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do it is important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals , not in a way that wounds . Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world , and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding . In the words of Job , When I looked for light , then came darkness . Bad things happen , and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath . For the truth is none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack . None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired , or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man s mind . Yes , we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy . We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence . We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future . But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other . That we cannot do . That we cannot do . As we discuss these issues , let each of us do so with a good dose of humility . Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame , let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations , to listen to each other more carefully , to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together . After all , that is what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family especially if the loss is unexpected . We are shaken out of our routines . We are forced to look inward . We reflect on the past Did we spend enough time with an aging parent , we wonder . Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them , not just once in a while but every single day So sudden loss causes us to look backward but it also forces us to look forward to reflect on the present and the future , on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us . We may ask ourselves if we have shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives . Perhaps we question whether we are doing right by our children , or our community , whether our priorities are in order . We recognize our own mortality , and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth , what matters is not wealth , or status , or power , or fame but rather , how well we have loved and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better . And that process that process of reflection , of making sure we align our values with our actions that , I believe , is what a tragedy like this requires . For those who were harmed , those who were killed they are part of our family , an American family 300 million strong . We may not have known them personally , but surely we see ourselves in them . In George and Dot , in Dorwan and Mavy , we sense the abiding love we have for our own husbands , our own wives , our own life partners . Phyllis she is our mom or our grandma Gabe our brother or son . In Judge Roll , we recognize not only a man who prized his family and doing his job well , but also a man who embodied America s fidelity to the law . And in Gabby in Gabby , we see a reflection of our public spiritedness that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating , sometimes contentious , but always necessary and never ending process to form a more perfect union . And in Christina in Christina we see all of our children . So curious , so trusting , so energetic , so full of magic . So deserving of our love . And so deserving of our good example . If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate as it should let us make sure it is worthy of those we have lost . Let us make sure it is not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle . The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better . To be better in our private lives , to be better friends and neighbors and coworkers and parents . And if , as has been discussed in recent days , their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse , let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy it did not but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way that would make them proud . We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords , who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans , and that we can question each other s ideas without questioning each other s love of country and that our task , working together , is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations . They believed they believed , and I believe that we can be better . Those who died here , those who saved life here they help me believe . We may not be able to stop all evil in the world , but I know that how we treat one another , that is entirely up to us . And I believe that for all our imperfections , we are full of decency and goodness , and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us . That is what I believe , in part because that is what a child like Christina Taylor Green believed . Imagine imagine for a moment , here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship just starting to glimpse the fact that some day she , too , might play a part in shaping her nation s future . She had been elected to her student council . She saw public service as something exciting and hopeful . She was off to meet her congresswoman , someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model . She saw all this through the eyes of a child , undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted . I want to live up to her expectations . I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it . I want America to be as good as she imagined it . All of us we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children s expectations . As has already been mentioned , Christina was given to us on September 11th , 2001 , one of 50 babies born that day to be pictured in a book called Faces of Hope . On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a child s life . I hope you help those in need , read one . I hope you know all the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart . I hope you jump in rain puddles . If there are rain puddles in Heaven , Christina is jumping in them today . And here on this Earth here on this Earth , we place our hands over our hearts , and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle , happy spirit . May God bless and keep those we have lost in restful and eternal peace . May He love and watch over the survivors . And may He bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress , as well as your new Speaker , John Boehner . And as we mark this occasion , we are also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber , and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend Gabby Giffords . It is no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years . The debates have been contentious we have fought fiercely for our beliefs . And that is a good thing . That is what a robust democracy demands . That is what helps set us apart as a nation . But there is a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause . Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate , Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from , each of us is a part of something greater something more consequential than party or political preference . We are part of the American family . We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found , we are still bound together as one people that we share common hopes and a common creed that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children , and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled . That , too , is what sets us apart as a nation . Now , by itself , this simple recognition will not usher in a new era of cooperation . What comes of this moment is up to us . What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight , but whether we can work together tomorrow . I believe we can . And I believe we must . That is what the people who sent us here expect of us . With their votes , they have determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties . New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans . We will move forward together , or not at all for the challenges we face are bigger than party , and bigger than politics . At stake right now is not who wins the next election after all , we just had an election . At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country , or somewhere else . It is whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded . It is whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map , but the light to the world . We are poised for progress . Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known , the stock market has come roaring back . Corporate profits are up . The economy is growing again . But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone . We measure progress by the success of our people . By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer . By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise . By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children . That is the project the American people want us to work on . Together . We did that in December . Thanks to the tax cuts we passed , Americans paychecks are a little bigger today . Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year . And these steps , taken by Democrats and Republicans , will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year . But we have to do more . These steps we have taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession , but to win the future , we will need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making . Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown . You did not always need a degree , and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors . If you worked hard , chances are you had have a job for life , with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion . Maybe you had even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company . That world has changed . And for many , the change has been painful . I have seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories , and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets . I have heard it in the frustrations of Americans who have seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game . They are right . The rules have changed . In a single generation , revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live , work and do business . Steel mills that once needed 1 , 000 workers can now do the same work with 100 . Today , just about any company can set up shop , hire workers , and sell their products wherever there is an Internet connection . Meanwhile , nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own , they could compete in this new world . And so they started educating their children earlier and longer , with greater emphasis on math and science . They are investing in research and new technologies . Just recently , China became the home to the world s largest private solar research facility , and the world s fastest computer . So , yes , the world has changed . The competition for jobs is real . But this should not discourage us . It should challenge us . Remember for all the hits we have taken these last few years , for all the naysayers predicting our decline , America still has the largest , most prosperous economy in the world . No workers no workers are more productive than ours . No country has more successful companies , or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs . We are the home to the world s best colleges and universities , where more students come to study than any place on Earth . What is more , we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny . That is why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here . It is why our students do not just memorize equations , but answer questions like What do you think of that idea What would you change about the world What do you want to be when you grow up The future is ours to win . But to get there , we cannot just stand still . As Robert Kennedy told us , The future is not a gift . It is an achievement . Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat . It has required each generation to sacrifice , and struggle , and meet the demands of a new age . And now it is our turn . We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time . We need to out innovate , out educate , and out build the rest of the world . We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business . We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government . That is how our people will prosper . That is how we will win the future . And tonight , I had like to talk about how we get there . The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation . None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from . Thirty years ago , we could not know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution . What we can do what America does better than anyone else is spark the creativity and imagination of our people . We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers of Google and Facebook . In America , innovation does not just change our lives . It is how we make our living . Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation . But because it is not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research , throughout our history , our government has provided cutting edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need . That is what planted the seeds for the Internet . That is what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPJust think of all the good jobs from manufacturing to retail that have come from these breakthroughs . Half a century ago , when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik , we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon . The science was not even there yet . NASA did not exist . But after investing in better research and education , we did not just surpass the Soviets we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs . This is our generation s Sputnik moment . Two years ago , I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we have not seen since the height of the Space Race . And in a few weeks , I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal . We will invest in biomedical research , information technology , and especially clean energy technology an investment that will strengthen our security , protect our planet , and create countless new jobs for our people . Already , we are seeing the promise of renewable energy . Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company . After September 11th , they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon . But half of their factory went unused , and the recession hit them hard . Today , with the help of a government loan , that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country . In Robert s words , We reinvented ourselves . That is what Americans have done for over 200 years reinvented ourselves . And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers , we have begun to reinvent our energy policy . We are not just handing out money . We are issuing a challenge . We are telling America s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields , and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy , we will fund the Apollo projects of our time . At the California Institute of Technology , they are developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars . At Oak Ridge National Laboratory , they are using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities . With more research and incentives , we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels , and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 . We need to get behind this innovation . And to help pay for it , I am asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies . I do not know if I do not know if you have noticed , but they are doing just fine on their own . So instead of subsidizing yesterday s energy , let us invest in tomorrow s . Now , clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they are selling . So tonight , I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal By 2035 , 80 percent of America s electricity will come from clean energy sources . Some folks want wind and solar . Others want nuclear , clean coal and natural gas . To meet this goal , we will need them all and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen . Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America s success . But if we want to win the future if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas then we also have to win the race to educate our kids . Think about it . Over the next 10 years , nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education . And yet , as many as a quarter of our students are not even finishing high school . The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations . America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree . And so the question is whether all of us as citizens , and as parents are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed . That responsibility begins not in our classrooms , but in our homes and communities . It is family that first instills the love of learning in a child . Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done . We need to teach our kids that it is not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated , but the winner of the science fair . We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or Pbut of hard work and discipline . Our schools share this responsibility . When a child walks into a classroom , it should be a place of high expectations and high performance . But too many schools do not meet this test . That is why instead of just pouring money into a system that is not working , we launched a competition called Race to the Top . To all 50 states , we said , If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement , we will show you the money . Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation . For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year , it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning . And these standards were developed , by the way , not by Washington , but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country . And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and focused on what is best for our kids . You see , we know what is possible from our children when reform is not just a top down mandate , but the work of local teachers and principals , school boards and communities . Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver . Three years ago , it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado located on turf between two rival gangs . But last May , 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma . Most will be the first in their families to go to college . And after the first year of the school s transformation , the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said , Thank you , Ms . Waters , for showing that we are smart and we can make it . That is what good schools can do , and we want good schools all across the country . Let us also remember that after parents , the biggest impact on a child s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom . In South Korea , teachers are known as nation builders . Here in America , it is time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect . We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones . And over the next 10 years , with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms , we want to prepare 100 , 000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math . In fact , to every young person listening tonight who is contemplating their career choice If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher . Your country needs you . Of course , the education race does not end with a high school diploma . To compete , higher education must be within the reach of every American . That is why we have ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks , and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students . And this year , I ask Congress to go further , and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth 10 , 000 for four years of college . It is the right thing to do . Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today s fast changing economy , we are also revitalizing America s community colleges . Last month , I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina . Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town . One mother of two , a woman named Kathy Proctor , had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old . And she told me she is earning her degree in biotechnology now , at 55 years old , not just because the furniture jobs are gone , but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams , too . As Kathy said , I hope it tells them to never give up . If we take these steps if we raise expectations for every child , and give them the best possible chance at an education , from the day they are born until the last job they take we will reach the goal that I set two years ago By the end of the decade , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . One last point about education . Today , there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens . Some are the children of undocumented workers , who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents . They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag , and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation . Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities . But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees , we send them back home to compete against us . It makes no sense . Now , I strongly believe that we should take on , once and for all , the issue of illegal immigration . And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders , enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows . I know that debate will be difficult . I know it will take time . But tonight , let us agree to make that effort . And let us stop expelling talented , responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business , who could be further enriching this nation . The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America . To attract new businesses to our shores , we need the fastest , most reliable ways to move people , goods , and information from high speed rail to high speed Internet . Our infrastructure used to be the best , but our lead has slipped . South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do . Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do . China is building faster trains and newer airports . Meanwhile , when our own engineers graded our nation s infrastructure , they gave us a D . We have to do better . America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad , brought electricity to rural communities , constructed the Interstate Highway System . The jobs created by these projects did not just come from laying down track or pavement . They came from businesses that opened near a town s new train station or the new off ramp . So over the last two years , we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century , a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard hit construction industry . And tonight , I am proposing that we redouble those efforts . We will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges . We will make sure this is fully paid for , attract private investment , and pick projects based what is best for the economy , not politicians . Within 25 years , our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high speed rail . This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car . For some trips , it will be faster than flying without the pat down . As we speak , routes in California and the Midwest are already underway . Within the next five years , we will make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans . This is not just about this is not about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls . It is about connecting every part of America to the digital age . It is about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world . It is about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device a student who can take classes with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chats with her doctor . All these investments in innovation , education , and infrastructure will make America a better place to do business and create jobs . But to help our companies compete , we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success . For example , over the years , a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries . Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all . But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world . It makes no sense , and it has to change . So tonight , I am asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system . Get rid of the loopholes . Level the playing field . And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit . It can be done . To help businesses sell more products abroad , we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 because the more we export , the more jobs we create here at home . Already , our exports are up . Recently , we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250 , 000 jobs here in the United States . And last month , we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70 , 000 American jobs . This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor , Democrats and Republicans and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible . Now , before I took office , I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements , and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs . That is what we did with Korea , and that is what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks . To reduce barriers to growth and investment , I have ordered a review of government regulations . When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses , we will fix them . But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common sense safeguards to protect the American people . That is what we have done in this country for more than a century . It is why our food is safe to eat , our water is safe to drink , and our air is safe to breathe . It is why we have speed limits and child labor laws . It is why last year , we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis . And it is why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients . Now , I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law . So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved . If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable , I am eager to work with you . We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses . What I am not willing to do what I am not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition . I am not willing to tell James Howard , a brain cancer patient from Texas , that his treatment might not be covered . I am not willing to tell Jim Houser , a small business man from Oregon , that he has to go back to paying 5 , 000 more to cover his employees . As we speak , this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients parents coverage . So I say to this chamber tonight , instead of re fighting the battles of the last two years , let us fix what needs fixing and let us move forward . Now , the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we are not buried under a mountain of debt . We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago . And in the wake of the financial crisis , some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing , save jobs , and put money in people s pockets . But now that the worst of the recession is over , we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in . That is not sustainable . Every day , families sacrifice to live within their means . They deserve a government that does the same . So tonight , I am proposing that starting this year , we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years . Now , this would reduce the deficit by more than 400 billion over the next decade , and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President . This freeze will require painful cuts . Already , we have frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years . I have proposed cuts to things I care deeply about , like community action programs . The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without . I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts , and I am willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without . But let us make sure that we are not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens . And let us make sure that what we are cutting is really excess weight . Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine . It may make you feel like you are flying high at first , but it will not take long before you feel the impact . Now , most of the cuts and savings I have proposed only address annual domestic spending , which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget . To make further progress , we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough . It will not . The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear . I do not agree with all their proposals , but they made important progress . And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it in domestic spending , defense spending , health care spending , and spending through tax breaks and loopholes . This means further reducing health care costs , including programs like Medicare and Medicaid , which are the single biggest contributor to our long term deficit . The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs , which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit . Still , I am willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs , including one that Republicans suggested last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits . To put us on solid ground , we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations . We must do it without putting at risk current retirees , the most vulnerable , or people with disabilities without slashing benefits for future generations and without subjecting Americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market . And if we truly care about our deficit , we simply cannot afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students , we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break . It is not a matter of punishing their success . It is about promoting America s success . In fact , the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code . This will be a tough job , but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this , and I am prepared to join them . So now is the time to act . Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress Democrats and Republicans to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done . If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits , we can make the investments we need to win the future . Let me take this one step further . We should not just give our people a government that is more affordable . We should give them a government that is more competent and more efficient . We cannot win the future with a government of the past . We live and do business in the Information Age , but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white TThere are 12 different agencies that deal with exports . There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy . Then there is my favorite example The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they are in fresh water , but the Commerce Department handles them when they are in saltwater . I hear it gets even more complicated once they are smoked . Now , we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste . Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse . We are selling acres of federal office space that has not been used in years , and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more . But we need to think bigger . In the coming months , my administration will develop a proposal to merge , consolidate , and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America . I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote and we will push to get it passed . In the coming year , we will also work to rebuild people s faith in the institution of government . Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent , you will be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history . Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists , I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done put that information online . And because the American people deserve to know that special interests are not larding up legislation with pet projects , both parties in Congress should know this If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside , I will veto it . I will veto it . The 21st century government that is open and competent . A government that lives within its means . An economy that is driven by new skills and new ideas . Our success in this new and changing world will require reform , responsibility , and innovation . It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs . Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders , so can new threats and new challenges . No single wall separates East and West . No one rival superpower is aligned against us . And so we must defeat determined enemies , wherever they are , and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion . And America s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity . And because we have begun this work , tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America s standing has been restored . Look to Iraq , where nearly 100 , 000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high . American combat patrols have ended , violence is down , and a new government has been formed . This year , our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people , while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq . America s commitment has been kept . The Iraq war is coming to an end . Of course , as we speak , al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us . Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals , we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies . And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders , we are responding with the strength of our communities , with respect for the rule of law , and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family . We have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad . In Afghanistan , our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces . Our purpose is clear By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people , we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9 11 . Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians , fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency . There will be tough fighting ahead , and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance . But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them . This year , we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead . And this July , we will begin to bring our troops home . In Pakistan , al Qaeda s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001 . Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield . Their safe havens are shrinking . And we have sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe We will not relent , we will not waver , and we will defeat you . American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war . Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty , far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed . Because we rallied the world , nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists . Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations , the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions , tighter sanctions than ever before . And on the Korean Peninsula , we stand with our ally South Korea , and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons . This is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity . With our European allies , we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense . We have reset our relationship with Russia , strengthened Asian alliances , built new partnerships with nations like India . This March , I will travel to Brazil , Chile , and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas . Around the globe , we are standing with those who take responsibility helping farmers grow more food , supporting doctors who care for the sick , and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity . Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power it must also be the purpose behind it . In south Sudan with our assistance the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war . Thousands lined up before dawn . People danced in the streets . One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him This was a battlefield for most of my life , he said . Now we want to be free . And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia , where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator . And tonight , let us be clear The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia , and supports the democratic aspirations of all people . We must never forget that the things we have struggled for , and fought for , live in the hearts of people everywhere . And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country . Tonight , let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families . Let us serve them as well as they have served us by giving them the equipment they need , by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned , and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation . Our troops come from every corner of this country they are black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American . They are Christian and Hindu , Jewish and Muslim . And , yes , we know that some of them are gay . Starting this year , no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love . And with that change , I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTIt is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past . It is time to move forward as one nation . We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us . Reforming our schools , changing the way we use energy , reducing our deficit none of this will be easy . All of it will take time . And it will be harder because we will argue about everything . The costs . The details . The letter of every law . Of course , some countries do not have this problem . If the central government wants a railroad , they build a railroad , no matter how many homes get bulldozed . If they do not want a bad story in the newspaper , it does not get written . And yet , as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be , I know there is not a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth . We may have differences in policy , but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution . We may have different opinions , but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try . We may have different backgrounds , but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible . No matter who you are . No matter where you come from . That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight . That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me . That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth . That dream that American Dream is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era . It is what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future . And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher . Brandon started a company in Berlin , Pennsylvania , that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology . And one day last summer , he saw the news that halfway across the world , 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine , and no one knew how to save them . But Brandon thought his company could help . And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment . And Brandon left for Chile . Along with others , he began drilling a 2 , 000 foot hole into the ground , working three or four hour three or four days at a time without any sleep . Thirty seven days later , Plan B succeeded , and the miners were rescued . But because he did not want all of the attention , Brandon was not there when the miners emerged . He had already gone back home , back to work on his next project . And later , one of his employees said of the rescue , We proved that Center Rock is a little company , but we do big things . We do big things . From the earliest days of our founding , America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream . That is how we win the future . We are a nation that says , I might not have a lot of money , but I have this great idea for a new company . I might not come from a family of college graduates , but I will be the first to get my degree . I might not know those people in trouble , but I think I can help them , and I need to try . I am not sure how we will reach that better place beyond the horizon , but I know we will get there . I know we will . We do big things . The idea of America endures . Our destiny remains our choice . And tonight , more than two centuries later , it is because of our people that our future is hopeful , our journey goes forward , and the state of our union is strong . Thank you . God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , everybody . As a candidate for President , I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world . After taking office , I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011 . As Commander in Chief , ensuring the success of this strategy has been one of my highest national security priorities . Last year , I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq . And to date , we have removed more than 100 , 000 troops . Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country s security . A few hours ago I spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki . I reaffirmed that the United States keeps its commitments . He spoke of the determination of the Iraqi people to forge their own future . We are in full agreement about how to move forward . So today , I can report that , as promised , the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year . After nearly nine years , America s war in Iraq will be over . Over the next two months , our troops in Iraq tens of thousands of them will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their heads held high , proud of their success , and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops . That is how America s military efforts in Iraq will end . But even as we mark this important milestone , we are also moving into a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Iraq . As of January 1st , and in keeping with our Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq , it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations , an equal partnership based on mutual interests and mutual respect . In today s conversation , Prime Minister Maliki and I agreed that a meeting of the Higher Coordinating Committee of the Strategic Framework Agreement will convene in the coming weeks . And I invited the Prime Minister to come to the White House in December , as we plan for all the important work that we have to do together . This will be a strong and enduring partnership . With our diplomats and civilian advisors in the lead , we will help Iraqis strengthen institutions that are just , representative and accountable . We will build new ties of trade and of commerce , culture and education , that unleash the potential of the Iraqi people . We will partner with an Iraq that contributes to regional security and peace , just as we insist that other nations respect Iraq s sovereignty . As I told Prime Minister Maliki , we will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces again , just as we offer training and assistance to countries around the world . After all , there will be some difficult days ahead for Iraq , and the United States will continue to have an interest in an Iraq that is stable , secure and self reliant . Just as Iraqis have persevered through war , I am confident that they can build a future worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization . Here at home , the coming months will be another season of homecomings . Across America , our servicemen and women will be reunited with their families . Today , I can say that our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays . This December will be a time to reflect on all that we have been though in this war . I will join the American people in paying tribute to the more than 1 million Americans who have served in Iraq . We will honor our many wounded warriors and the nearly 4 , 500 American patriots and their Iraqi and coalition partners who gave their lives to this effort . And finally , I would note that the end of war in Iraq reflects a larger transition . The tide of war is receding . The drawdown in Iraq allowed us to refocus our fight against al Qaeda and achieve major victories against its leadership including Osama bin Laden . Now , even as we remove our last troops from Iraq , we are beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan , where we have begun a transition to Afghan security and leadership . When I took office , roughly 180 , 000 troops were deployed in both these wars . And by the end of this year that number will be cut in half , and make no mistake It will continue to go down . Meanwhile , yesterday marked the definitive end of the Qaddafi regime in Libya . And there , too , our military played a critical role in shaping a situation on the ground in which the Libyan people can build their own future . Today , NATO is working to bring this successful mission to a close . So to sum up , the United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year . The transition in Afghanistan is moving forward , and our troops are finally coming home . As they do , fewer deployments and more time training will help keep our military the very best in the world . And as we welcome home our newest veterans , we will never stop working to give them and their families the care , the benefits and the opportunities that they have earned . This includes enlisting our veterans in the greatest challenge that we now face as a nation creating opportunity and jobs in this country . Because after a decade of war , the nation that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own an America that sees its economic strength restored just as we have restored our leadership around the globe . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you , Governor . To all the families , first responders , to the community of Newtown , clergy , guests Scripture tells us hellip do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away hellip inwardly we are being renewed day by day . For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all . So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal . For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , an eternal house in heaven , not built by human hands . We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults . They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America . Here in Newtown , I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation . I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow , nor can they heal your wounded hearts . I can only hope it helps for you to know that you are not alone in your grief that our world too has been torn apart that all across this land of ours , we have wept with you , we have pulled our children tight . And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide , we will provide whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load , we will gladly bear it . Newtown you are not alone . As these difficult days have unfolded , you have also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice . We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary , the school s staff did not flinch , they did not hesitate . Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach , Vicki Soto , Lauren Rousseau , Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances with courage and with love , giving their lives to protect the children in their care . We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms , and kept steady through it all , and reassured their students by saying wait for the good guys , they are coming show me your smile . And we know that good guys came . The first responders who raced to the scene , helping to guide those in harm s way to safety , and comfort those in need , holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do , and others needed them more . And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren , helping one another , holding each other , dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do one child even trying to encourage a grown up by saying , I know karate . So it is okay . I will lead the way out . As a community , you have inspired us , Newtown . In the face of indescribable violence , in the face of unconscionable evil , you have looked out for each other , and you have cared for one another , and you have loved one another . This is how Newtown will be remembered . And with time , and God s grace , that love will see you through . But we , as a nation , we are left with some hard questions . Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time , walking around . With their very first cry , this most precious , vital part of ourselves our child is suddenly exposed to the world , to possible mishap or malice . And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm . And yet , we also know that with that child s very first step , and each step after that , they are separating from us that we will not that we cannot always be there for them . They will suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments . And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self reliant and capable and resilient , ready to face the world without fear . And we know we cannot do this by ourselves . It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize , no matter how much you love these kids , you cannot do it by yourself . That this job of keeping our children safe , and teaching them well , is something we can only do together , with the help of friends and neighbors , the help of a community , and the help of a nation . And in that way , we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we are counting on everybody else to help look after ours that we are all parents that they are all our children . This is our first task caring for our children . It is our first job . If we do not get that right , we do not get anything right . That is how , as a society , we will be judged . And by that measure , can we truly say , as a nation , that we are meeting our obligations Can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our children all of them safe from harm Can we claim , as a nation , that we are all together there , letting them know that they are loved , and teaching them to love in return Can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose I have been reflecting on this the last few days , and if we are honest with ourselves , the answer is no . We are not doing enough . And we will have to change . Since I have been President , this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting . The fourth time we have hugged survivors . The fourth time we have consoled the families of victims . And in between , there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country , almost daily reports of victims , many of them children , in small towns and big cities all across America victims whose much of the time , their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time . We cannot tolerate this anymore . These tragedies must end . And to end them , we must change . We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex , and that is true . No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world , or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society . But that cannot be an excuse for inaction . Surely , we can do better than this . If there is even one step we can take to save another child , or another parent , or another town , from the grief that has visited Tucson , and Aurora , and Oak Creek , and Newtown , and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that then surely we have an obligation to try . In the coming weeks , I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . Because what choice do we have We cannot accept events like this as routine . Are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom All the world s religions so many of them represented here today start with a simple question Why are we here What gives our life meaning What gives our acts purpose We know our time on this Earth is fleeting . We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain that even after we chase after some earthly goal , whether it is wealth or power or fame , or just simple comfort , we will , in some fashion , fall short of what we had hoped . We know that no matter how good our intentions , we will all stumble sometimes , in some way . We will make mistakes , we will experience hardships . And even when we are trying to do the right thing , we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness , so often unable to discern God s heavenly plans . There is only one thing we can be sure of , and that is the love that we have for our children , for our families , for each other . The warmth of a small child s embrace that is true . The memories we have of them , the joy that they bring , the wonder we see through their eyes , that fierce and boundless love we feel for them , a love that takes us out of ourselves , and binds us to something larger we know that is what matters . We know we are always doing right when we are taking care of them , when we are teaching them well , when we are showing acts of kindness . We do not go wrong when we do that . That is what we can be sure of . And that is what you , the people of Newtown , have reminded us . That is how you have inspired us . You remind us what matters . And that is what should drive us forward in everything we do , for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth . Let the little children come to me , Jesus said , and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven . Charlotte . Daniel . Olivia . Josephine . Ana . Dylan . Madeleine . Catherine . Chase . Jesse . James . Grace . Emilie . Jack . Noah . Caroline . Jessica . Benjamin . Avielle . Allison . God has called them all home . For those of us who remain , let us find the strength to carry on , and make our country worthy of their memory . May God bless and keep those we have lost in His heavenly place . May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort . And may He bless and watch over this community , and the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you so much . Well , it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem , and I am so grateful for the welcome that I have received from the people of Israel . Thank you . I bring with me the support of the American people and the friendship that binds us together . Over the last two days , I have reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres . I have borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book , and I have seen Israel s shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs . This is a nation of museums and patents , timeless holy sites and ground breaking innovation . Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology on board the Mars Rover originated at the same time . But what I have most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you , the Israeli people especially so many young people who are here today to talk about the history that brought us here today , and the future that you will make in the years to come . Now , I know that in Israel s vibrant democracy , every word , every gesture is carefully scrutinized . But I want to clear something up just so you know any drama between me and my friend , Bibi , over the years was just a plot to create material for Eretz Nehederet . That is the only thing that was going on . We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material . I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday the celebration of Passover . And that is where I would like to begin today . Just a few days from now , Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the Seder table , and celebrate with songs , wine and symbolic foods . After enjoying Seders with family and friends in Chicago and on the campaign trail , I am proud that I have now brought this tradition into the White House . I did so because I wanted my daughters to experience the Haggadah , and the story at the center of Passover that makes this time of year so powerful . It is a story of centuries of slavery , and years of wandering in the desert a story of perseverance amidst persecution , and faith in God and the Torah . It is a story about finding freedom in your own land . And for the Jewish people , this story is central to who you have become . But it is also a story that holds within it the universal human experience , with all of its suffering , but also all of its salvation . It is a part of the three great religions Judaism , Christianity , and Islam that trace their origins to Abraham , and see Jerusalem as sacred . And it is a story that is inspired communities across the globe , including me and my fellow Americans . In the United States a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew we are naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land . To African Americans , the story of the Exodus was perhaps the central story , the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today . For generations , this promise helped people weather poverty and persecution , while holding on to the hope that a better day was on the horizon . For me , personally , growing up in far flung parts of the world and without firm roots , the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home . Of course , even as we draw strength from the story of God s will and His gift of freedom expressed on Passover , we also know that here on Earth we must bear our responsibilities in an imperfect world . That means accepting our measure of sacrifice and struggle , just like previous generations . It means us working through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom . As Dr . Martin Luther King said on the day before he was killed , I may not get there with you . But I want you to know that we , as a people , will get to the promised land . So just as Joshua carried on after Moses , the work goes on for all of you , the Joshua Generation , for justice and dignity for opportunity and freedom . For the Jewish people , the journey to the promise of the State of Israel wound through countless generations . It involved centuries of suffering and exile , prejudice and pogroms and even genocide . Through it all , the Jewish people sustained their unique identity and traditions , as well as a longing to return home . And while Jews achieved extraordinary success in many parts of the world , the dream of true freedom finally found its full expression in the Zionist idea to be a free people in your homeland . That is why I believe that Israel is rooted not just in history and tradition , but also in a simple and profound idea the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own . Over the last 65 years , when Israel has been at its best , Israelis have demonstrated that responsibility does not end when you reach the promised land , it only begins . And so Israel has been a refuge for the diaspora welcoming Jews from Europe , from the former Soviet Union , from Ethiopia , from North Africa . Israel has built a prosperous nation through kibbutzeem that made the desert bloom , business that broadened the middle class , innovators who reached new frontiers , from the smallest microchip to the orbits of space . Israel has established a thriving democracy , with a spirited civil society and proud political parties , and a tireless free press , and a lively public debate lively may even be an understatement . And Israel has achieved all this even as it is overcome relentless threats to its security through the courage of the Israel Defense Forces , and the citizenry that is so resilient in the face of terror . This is the story of Israel . This is the work that has brought the dreams of so many generations to life . And every step of the way , Israel has built unbreakable bonds of friendship with my country , the United States of America . Those ties began only 11 minutes after Israeli independence , when the United States was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel . As President Truman said in explaining his decision to recognize Israel , he said , I believe it has a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation , but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization . And since then , we have built a friendship that advances our shared interests . Together , we share a commitment to security for our citizens and the stability of the Middle East and North Africa . Together , we share a focus on advancing economic growth around the globe , and strengthening the middle class within our own countries . Together , we share a stake in the success of democracy . But the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests , just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders . America is a nation of immigrants . America is strengthened by diversity . America is enriched by faith . We are governed not simply by men and women , but by laws . We are fueled by entrepreneurship and innovation , and we are defined by a democratic discourse that allows each generation to reimagine and renew our union once more . So in Israel , we see values that we share , even as we recognize what makes us different . That is an essential part of our bond . Now , I stand here today mindful that for both our nations , these are some complicated times . We have difficult issues to work through within our own countries , and we face dangers and upheaval around the world . And when I look at young people within the United States , I think about the choices that they must make in their lives to define who we will be as a nation in this 21st century , particularly as we emerge from two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression . But part of the reason I like talking to young people is because no matter how great the challenges are , their idealism , their energy , their ambition always gives me hope . And I see the same spirit in the young people here today . I believe that you will shape our future . And given the ties between our countries , I believe your future is bound to ours . No , no this is part of the lively debate that we talked about . This is good . You know , I have to say we actually arranged for that , because it made me feel at home . I would not feel comfortable if I did not have at least one heckler . I had like to focus on how we and when I say we , in particular young people can work together to make progress in three areas that will define our times security , peace and prosperity . Let me begin with security . I am proud that the security relationship between the United States and Israel has never been stronger . Never . More exercises between our militaries more exchanges among our political and military and intelligence officials than ever before the largest program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge . These are the facts . These are not my opinions , these are facts . But , to me , this is not simply measured on a balance sheet . I know that here , in Israel , security is something personal . Here s what I think about when I consider these issues . When I consider Israel s security , I think about children like Osher Twito , who I met in Sderot children the same age as my own daughters who went to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they are and where they live . That reality is why we have invested in the Iron Dome system to save countless lives because those children deserve to sleep better at night . That is why we have made it clear , time and again , that Israel cannot accept rocket attacks from Gaza , and we have stood up for Israel s right to defend itself . And that is why Israel has a right to expect Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel s right to exist . When I think about Israel s security , I think about five Israelis who boarded a bus in Bulgaria , who were blown up because of where they came from robbed of the ability to live , and love , and raise families . That is why every country that values justice should call Hizbollah what it truly is a terrorist organization . Because the world cannot tolerate an organization that murders innocent civilians , stockpiles rockets to shoot at cities , and supports the massacre of men and women and children in Syria right now . The fact that Hizbollah s ally the Assad regime has stockpiles of chemical weapons only heightens the urgency . We will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger . I have made it clear to Bashar al Assad and all who follow his orders We will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people , or the transfer of those weapons to terrorists . The world is watching we will hold you accountable . The Syrian people have the right to be freed from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power . Assad must go so that Syria s future can begin . Because true stability in Syria depends upon establishing a government that is responsible to its people one that protects all communities within its borders , while making peace with countries beyond them . These are the things I think about when I think about Israel s security . When I consider Israel s security , I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust , faced with the prospect of a nuclear armed Iranian government that has called for Israel s destruction . It is no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat . But this is not simply a challenge for Israel it is a danger for the entire world , including the United States . A nuclear armed Iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism . It would undermine the non proliferation regime . It would spark an arms race in a volatile region . And it would embolden a government that has shown no respect for the rights of its own people or the responsibilities of nations . That is why America has built a coalition to increase the cost to Iran of failing to meet their obligations . The Iranian government is now under more pressure than ever before , and that pressure is increasing . It is isolated . Its economy is in dire straits . Its leadership is divided . And its position in the region , and the world has only grown weaker . I do believe that all of us have an interest in resolving this issue peacefully . Strong and principled diplomacy is the best way to ensure that the Iranian government forsakes nuclear weapons . Peace is far more preferable to war . And the inevitable costs , the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically . Because of the cooperation between our governments , we know that there remains time to pursue a diplomatic resolution . That is what America will do , with clear eyes working with a world that is united , and with the sense of urgency that is required . But Iran must know this time is not unlimited . And I have made the position of the United States of America clear Iran must not get a nuclear weapon . This is not a danger that can be contained , and as President , I have said all options are on the table for achieving our objectives . America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear armed Iran . For young Israelis , I know that these issues of security are rooted in an experience that is even more fundamental than the pressing threat of the day . You live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbors have rejected the right of your nation to exist . Your grandparents had to risk their lives and all that they had to make a place for themselves in this world . Your parents lived through war after war to ensure the survival of the Jewish state . Your children grow up knowing that people they have never met may hate them because of who they are , in a region that is full of turmoil and changing underneath your feet . So that is what I think about when Israel is faced with these challenges that sense of an Israel that is surrounded by many in this region who still reject it , and many in the world who refuse to accept it . And that is why the security of the Jewish people in Israel is so important . It cannot be taken for granted . But make no mistake those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel s right to exist , they might as well reject the earth beneath them or the sky above , because Israel is not going anywhere . And today , I want to tell you particularly the young people so that there is no mistake here , so long as there is a United States of America Atem lo levad . You are not alone . The question is what kind of future Israel will look forward to . Israel is not going anywhere but especially for the young people in this audience , the question is what does its future hold And that brings me to the subject of peace . I know Israel has taken risks for peace . Brave leaders Menachem Begin , Yitzhak Rabin reached treaties with two of your neighbors . You made credible proposals to the Palestinians at Annapolis . You withdrew from Gaza and Lebanon , and then faced terror and rockets . Across the region , you have extended a hand of friendship and all too often you have been confronted with rejection and , in some cases , the ugly reality of anti Semitism . So I believe that the Israeli people do want peace , and I also understand why too many Israelis maybe an increasing number , maybe a lot of young people here today are skeptical that it can be achieved . But today , Israel is at a crossroads . It can be tempting to put aside the frustrations and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of peace , particularly when Iron Dome repels rockets , barriers keep out suicide bombers . There is so many other pressing issues that demand your attention . And I know that only Israelis can make the fundamental decisions about your country s future . I recognize that . I also know , by the way , that not everyone in this hall will agree with what I have to say about peace . I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace , but question its underlying premise , have a different vision for Israel s future . And that is part of a democracy . That is part of the discourse between our two countries . I recognize that . But I also believe it is important to be open and honest , especially with your friends . I also believe that . Politically , given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America , the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside just express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do that would be the easiest political path . But I want you to know that I speak to you as a friend who is deeply concerned and committed to your future , and I ask you to consider three points . First , peace is necessary . I believe that . I believe that peace is the only path to true security . You have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream , or you can face a growing challenge to its future . Given the demographics west of the Jordan River , the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine . That is true . There are other factors involved . Given the frustration in the international community about this conflict , Israel needs to reverse an undertow of isolation . And given the march of technology , the only way to truly protect the Israeli people over the long term is through the absence of war . Because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that is intent on doing so from inflicting harm . And this truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world . I understand that with the uncertainty in the region people in the streets , changes in leadership , the rise of non secular parties in politics it is tempting to turn inward , because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic . But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace . Because as more governments respond to popular will , the days when Israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leaders , those days are over . Peace will have to be made among peoples , not just governments . No one no single step can change overnight what lies in the hearts and minds of millions . No single step is going to erase years of history and propaganda . But progress with the Palestinians is a powerful way to begin , while sidelining extremists who thrive on conflict and thrive on division . It would make a difference . So peace is necessary . But peace is also just . Peace is also just . There is no question that Israel has faced Palestinian factions who turned to terror , leaders who missed historic opportunities . That is all true . And that is why security must be at the center of any agreement . And there is no question that the only path to peace is through negotiations which is why , despite the criticism we have received , the United States will oppose unilateral efforts to bypass negotiations through the United Nations . It has to be done by the parties . But the Palestinian people s right to self determination , their right to justice , must also be recognized . Put yourself in their shoes . Look at the world through their eyes . It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of their own . Living their entire lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements not just of those young people but their parents , their grandparents , every single day . It is not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished . It is not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands or restricting a student s ability to move around the West Bank or displace Palestinian families from their homes . Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer . Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland , Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land . I am going off script here for a second , but before I came here , I met with a group of young Palestinians from the age of 15 to 22 . And talking to them , they were not that different from my daughters . They were not that different from your daughters or sons . I honestly believe that if any Israeli parent sat down with those kids , they had say , I want these kids to succeed I want them to prosper . I want them to have opportunities just like my kids do . I believe that is what Israeli parents would want for these kids if they had a chance to listen to them and talk to them . I believe that . Now , only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have . But remember that as you make these decisions , you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the Palestinians you will define the future of Israel as well . As Ariel Sharon said I am quoting him It is impossible to have a Jewish democratic state , at the same time to control all of Eretz Israel . If we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety , we are liable to lose it all . Or , from a different perspective , I think of what the novelist David Grossman said shortly after losing his son , as he described the necessity of peace A peace of no choice he said , must be approached with the same determination and creativity as one approaches a war of no choice . Now , Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with anyone who is dedicated to its destruction . But while I know you have had differences with the Palestinian Authority , I genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad . I believe that . And they have a track record to prove it . Over the last few years , they have built institutions and maintained security on the West Bank in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago . So many Palestinians including young people have rejected violence as a means of achieving their aspirations . There is an opportunity there , there is a window which brings me to my third point Peace is possible . It is possible . I am not saying it is guaranteed . I cannot even say that it is more likely than not . But it is possible . I know it does not seem that way . There are always going to be reasons to avoid risk . There are costs for failure . There will always be extremists who provide an excuse not to act . I know there must be something exhausting about endless talks about talks , and daily controversies , and just the grinding status quo . And I am sure there is a temptation just to say , Ah , enough . Let me focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what I can control . But it is possible . Negotiations will be necessary , but there is little secret about where they must lead two states for two peoples . Two states for two peoples . There will be differences about how to get there . There are going to be hard choices along the way . Arab states must adapt to a world that has changed . The days when they could condemn Israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity , or government corruption or mismanagement those days need to be over . Now is the time for the Arab world to take steps toward normalizing relations with Israel . Meanwhile , Palestinians must recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security . Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace , and that an independent Palestine must be viable with real borders that have to be drawn . I have suggested principles on territory and security that I believe can be the basis for these talks . But for the moment , put aside the plans and the process . I ask you , instead , to think about what can be done to build trust between people . Four years ago , I stood in Cairo in front of an audience of young people politically , religiously , they must seem a world away . But the things they want , they are not so different from what the young people here want . They want the ability to make their own decisions and to get an education , get a good job to worship God in their own way to get married to raise a family . The same is true of those young Palestinians that I met with this morning . The same is true for young Palestinians who yearn for a better life in Gaza . That is where peace begins not just in the plans of leaders , but in the hearts of people . Not just in some carefully designed process , but in the daily connections that sense of empathy that takes place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of Jerusalem . And let me say this as a politician I can promise you this , political leaders will never take risks if the people do not push them to take some risks . You must create the change that you want to see . Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things . I know this is possible . Look to the bridges being built in business and civil society by some of you here today . Look at the young people who have not yet learned a reason to mistrust , or those young people who have learned to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherited from their parents , because they simply recognize that we hold more hopes in common than fears that drive us apart . Your voices must be louder than those who would drown out hope . Your hopes must light the way forward . Look to a future in which Jews and Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land . Believe in that . And most of all , look to the future that you want for your own children a future in which a Jewish , democratic , vibrant state is protected and accepted for this time and for all time . There will be many who say this change is not possible , but remember this Israel is the most powerful country in this region . Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world . Israel is not going anywhere . Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is , but this is in your nature Israel also has the courage to see the world as it should be . Ben Gurion once said , In Israel , in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles . Sometimes , the greatest miracle is recognizing that the world can change . That is a lesson that the world has learned from the Jewish people . And that brings me to the final area that I will focus on prosperity , and Israel s broader role in the world . I know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headlines , but that is not where people live . And every day , even amidst the threats that you face , Israelis are defining themselves by the opportunities that you are creating . Through talent and hard work , Israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy . Israelis understand the value of education and have produced 10 Nobel laureates . Israelis understand the power of invention , and your universities educate engineers and inventors . And that spirit has led to economic growth and human progress solar power and electric cars , bandages and prosthetic limbs that save lives , stem cell research and new drugs that treat disease , cell phones and computer technology that changed the way people around the world live . So if people want to see the future of the world economy , they should look at Tel Aviv , home to hundreds of start ups and research centers . Israelis are so active on social media that every day seemed to bring a different Facebook campaign about where I should give this speech . That innovation is just as important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as our security cooperation . Our first free trade agreement in the world was reached with Israel , nearly three decades ago . Today the trade between our two countries is at 40 billion every year . More importantly , that partnership is creating new products and medical treatments it is pushing new frontiers of science and exploration . That is the kind of relationship that Israel should have and could have with every country in the world . Already , we see how that innovation could reshape this region . There is a program here in Jerusalem that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to learn vital skills in technology and business . An Israeli and Palestinian have started a venture capital fund to finance Palestinian start ups . Over 100 high tech companies have found a home on the West Bank which speaks to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the Palestinian people . One of the great ironies of what is happening in the broader region is that so much of what people are yearning for education , entrepreneurship , the ability to start a business without paying a bribe , the ability to connect to the global economy those are things that can be found here in Israel . This should be a hub for thriving regional trade , and an engine for opportunity . Israel is already a center for innovation that helps power the global economy . And I believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhanced with greater security , enhanced with lasting peace . Here , in this small strip of land that has been the center of so much of the world s history , so much triumph and so much tragedy , Israelis have built something that few could have imagined 65 years ago . Tomorrow , I will pay tribute to that history at the grave of Herzl , a man who had the foresight to see the future of the Jewish people had to be reconnected to their past at the grave of Rabin , who understood that Israel s victories in war had to be followed by the battles for peace at Yad Vashem , where the world is reminded of the cloud of evil that can descend on the Jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant . We bear all that history on our shoulders . We carry all that history in our hearts . Today , as we face the twilight of Israel s founding generation , you the young people of Israel must now claim its future . It falls to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation . And as the President of a country that you can count on as your greatest friend I am confident that you can help us find the promise in the days that lie ahead . And as a man who is been inspired in my own life by that timeless calling within the Jewish experience tikkun olam I am hopeful that we can draw upon what is best in ourselves to meet the challenges that will come to win the battles for peace in the wake of so much war and to do the work of repairing this world . That is your job . That is my job . That is the task of all of us . May God bless you . May God bless Israel . May God bless the United States of America . Toda raba . Thank you .<speech_sep>I wanted to come out here , first of all , to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session . The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks , there is going to obviously be a whole range of issues immigration , economics , et cetera we will try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions . The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions , but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling . I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday . But watching the debate over the course of the last week , I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit . First of all , I want to make sure that , once again , I send my thoughts and prayers , as well as Michelle s , to the family of Trayvon Martin , and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they have dealt with the entire situation . I can only imagine what they are going through , and it is remarkable how they have handled it . The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday , which is there is going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case I will let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues . The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner . The prosecution and the defense made their arguments . The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant , and they rendered a verdict . And once the jury has spoken , that is how our system works . But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling . You know , when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son . Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago . And when you think about why , in the African American community at least , there is a lot of pain around what happened here , I think it is important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does not go away . There are very few African American men in this country who have not had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store . That includes me . There are very few African American men who have not had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars . That happens to me at least before I was a senator . There are very few African Americans who have not had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off . That happens often . And I do not want to exaggerate this , but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida . And it is inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear . The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws . And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case . Now , this is not to say that the African American community is na iuml ve about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence . It is not to make excuses for that fact although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context . They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country , and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history . And so the fact that sometimes that is unacknowledged adds to the frustration . And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given , well , there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain . I think the African American community is also not na iuml ve in understanding that , statistically , somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else . So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys . But they get frustrated , I think , if they feel that there is no context for it and that context is being denied . And that all contributes I think to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario , that , from top to bottom , both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different . Now , the question for me at least , and I think for a lot of folks , is where do we take this How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction I think it is understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests , and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through , as long as it remains nonviolent . If I see any violence , then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family . But beyond protests or vigils , the question is , are there some concrete things that we might be able to do . I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there , but I think it is important for people to have some clear expectations here . Traditionally , these are issues of state and local government , the criminal code . And law enforcement is traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal levels . That does not mean , though , that as a nation we cannot do some things that I think would be productive . So let me just give a couple of specifics that I am still bouncing around with my staff , so we are not rolling out some five point plan , but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus . Number one , precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level , I think it would be productive for the Justice Department , governors , mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists . When I was in Illinois , I passed racial profiling legislation , and it actually did just two simple things . One , it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped . But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing . And initially , the police departments across the state were resistant , but actually they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair , straightforward way that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and , in turn , be more helpful in applying the law . And obviously , law enforcement has got a very tough job . So that is one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if state and local governments are receptive . And I think a lot of them would be . And let us figure out are there ways for us to push out that kind of training . Along the same lines , I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case , rather than diffuse potential altercations . I know that there is been commentary about the fact that the stand your ground laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case . On the other hand , if we are sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there is a way for them to exit from a situation , is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we had like to see And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these stand your ground laws , I had just ask people to consider , if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed , could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr . Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous , then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws . Number three and this is a long term project we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys . And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about . There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement . And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them I am not na iuml ve about the prospects of some grand , new federal program . I am not sure that that is what we are talking about here . But I do recognize that as President , I have got some convening power , and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front . And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes , and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they are a full part of this society and that they have got pathways and avenues to succeed I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation . And we are going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that . And then , finally , I think it is going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching . There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race . I have not seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations . They end up being stilted and politicized , and folks are locked into the positions they already have . On the other hand , in families and churches and workplaces , there is the possibility that people are a little bit more honest , and at least you ask yourself your own questions about , am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can Am I judging people as much as I can , based on not the color of their skin , but the content of their character That would , I think , be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy . And let me just leave you with a final thought that , as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people , I do not want us to lose sight that things are getting better . Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race . It does not mean we are in a post racial society . It does not mean that racism is eliminated . But when I talk to Malia and Sasha , and I listen to their friends and I seem them interact , they are better than we are they are better than we were on these issues . And that is true in every community that I have visited all across the country . And so we have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues . And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature , as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions . But we should also have confidence that kids these days , I think , have more sense than we did back then , and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long , difficult journey , we are becoming a more perfect union not a perfect union , but a more perfect union . Thank you , guys .<speech_sep>Well , you know I love you back . It is a rare honor in this life to follow one of your heroes . And John Lewis is one of my heroes . Now , I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown Chapel , heroics were not on his mind . A day like this was not on his mind . Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were milling about . Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics of non violence the right way to protect yourself when attacked . A doctor described what tear gas does to the body , while marchers scribbled down instructions for contacting their loved ones . The air was thick with doubt , anticipation and fear . And they comforted themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sung No matter what may be the test , God will take care of you Lean , weary one , upon His breast , God will take care of you . And then , his knapsack stocked with an apple , a toothbrush , and a book on government all you need for a night behind bars John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to change America . President and Mrs . Bush , Governor Bentley , Mayor Evans , Sewell , Reverend Strong , members of Congress , elected officials , foot soldiers , friends , fellow Americans As John noted , there are places and moments in America where this nation s destiny has been decided . Many are sites of war Concord and Lexington , Appomattox , Gettysburg . Others are sites that symbolize the daring of America s character Independence Hall and Seneca Falls , Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral . Selma is such a place . In one afternoon 50 years ago , so much of our turbulent history the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow the death of four little girls in Birmingham and the dream of a Baptist preacher all that history met on this bridge . It was not a clash of armies , but a clash of wills a contest to determine the true meaning of America . And because of men and women like John Lewis , Joseph Lowery , Hosea Williams , Amelia Boynton , Diane Nash , Ralph Abernathy , Vivian , Andrew Young , Fred Shuttlesworth , Dr . Martin Luther King , Jr . , and so many others , the idea of a just America and a fair America , an inclusive America , and a generous America that idea ultimately triumphed . As is true across the landscape of American history , we cannot examine this moment in isolation . The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes . We gather here to celebrate them . We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod tear gas and the trampling hoof men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching towards justice . They did as Scripture instructed Rejoice in hope , be patient in tribulation , be constant in prayer . And in the days to come , they went back again and again . When the trumpet call sounded for more to join , the people came black and white , young and old , Christian and Jew , waving the American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and hope . A white newsman , Bill Plante , who covered the marches then and who is with us here today , quipped that the growing number of white people lowered the quality of the singing . To those who marched , though , those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweet . In time , their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson . And he would send them protection , and speak to the nation , echoing their call for America and the world to hear We shall overcome . What enormous faith these men and women had . Faith in God , but also faith in America . The Americans who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing . But they gave courage to millions . They held no elected office . But they led a nation . They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence , countless daily indignities but they did not seek special treatment , just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before . What they did here will reverberate through the ages . Not because the change they won was preordained not because their victory was complete but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible , that love and hope can conquer hate . As we commemorate their achievement , we are well served to remember that at the time of the marches , many in power condemned rather than praised them . Back then , they were called Communists , or half breeds , or outside agitators , sexual and moral degenerates , and worse they were called everything but the name their parents gave them . Their faith was questioned . Their lives were threatened . Their patriotism challenged . And yet , what could be more American than what happened in this place What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people unsung , the downtrodden , the dreamers not of high station , not born to wealth or privilege , not of one religious tradition but many , coming together to shape their country s course What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this , what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished , that we are strong enough to be self critical , that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals That is why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience . That is why it is not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance . It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents We the People hellip in order to form a more perfect union . We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal . These are not just words . They are a living thing , a call to action , a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny . For founders like Franklin and Jefferson , for leaders like Lincoln and FDthe success of our experiment in self government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work . And that is what we celebrate here in Selma . That is what this movement was all about , one leg in our long journey toward freedom . The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge , that is the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny . It is the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot , workers to organize against an unjust status quo the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon . It is the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths . It requires the occasional disruption , the willingness to speak out for what is right , to shake up the status quo . That is America . That is what makes us unique . That is what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity . Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall . Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid . Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule . They saw what John Lewis had done . From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine , this generation of young people can draw strength from this place , where the powerless could change the world s greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom . They saw that idea made real right here in Selma , Alabama . They saw that idea manifest itself here in America . Because of campaigns like this , a Voting Rights Act was passed . Political and economic and social barriers came down . And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms , who sit on the bench , who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office . Because of what they did , the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks , but for every American . Women marched through those doors . Latinos marched through those doors . Asian Americans , gay Americans , Americans with disabilities they all came through those doors . Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again , not by reasserting the past , but by transcending the past . What a glorious thing , Dr . King might say . And what a solemn debt we owe . Which leads us to ask , just how might we repay that debt First and foremost , we have to recognize that one day s commemoration , no matter how special , is not enough . If Selma taught us anything , it is that our work is never done . The American experiment in self government gives work and purpose to each generation . Selma teaches us , as well , that action requires that we shed our cynicism . For when it comes to the pursuit of justice , we can afford neither complacency nor despair . Just this week , I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justice s Ferguson report shows that , with respect to race , little has changed in this country . And I understood the question the report s narrative was sadly familiar . It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement . But I rejected the notion that nothing s changed . What happened in Ferguson may not be unique , but it is no longer endemic . It is no longer sanctioned by law or by custom . And before the Civil Rights Movement , it most surely was . We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable , that racial division is inherent to America . If you think nothing s changed in the past 50 years , ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s . Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing s changed . Ask your gay friend if it is easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago . To deny this progress , this hard won progress our progress would be to rob us of our own agency , our own capacity , our responsibility to do what we can to make America better . Of course , a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident that racism is banished that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete , and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the race card for their own purposes . We do not need the Ferguson report to know that is not true . We just need to open our eyes , and our ears , and our hearts to know that this nation s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us . We know the march is not yet over . We know the race is not yet won . We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged , all of us , by the content of our character requires admitting as much , facing up to the truth . We are capable of bearing a great burden , James Baldwin once wrote , once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is . There is nothing America cannot handle if we actually look squarely at the problem . And this is work for all Americans , not just some . Not just whites . Not just blacks . If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day , then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination . All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now . All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions , on our attitudes , the things we teach our children . And if we make such an effort , no matter how hard it may sometimes seem , laws can be passed , and consciences can be stirred , and consensus can be built . With such an effort , we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some . Together , we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect , and citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland , they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago the protection of the law . Together , we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons , and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men , and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads , and good workers , and good neighbors . With effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . Americans do not accept a free ride for anybody , nor do we believe in equality of outcomes . But we do expect equal opportunity . And if we really mean it , if we are not just giving lip service to it , but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it , then , yes , we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century , one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need . We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job , and a fair wage , and a real voice , and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle class . And with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge and that is the right to vote . Right now , in 2015 , 50 years after Selma , there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote . As we speak , more of such laws are being proposed . Meanwhile , the Voting Rights Act , the culmination of so much blood , so much sweat and tears , the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence , the Voting Rights Act stands weakened , its future subject to political rancor . How can that be The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy , the result of Republican and Democratic efforts . President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office . President George Bush signed its renewal when he was in office . One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it . If we want to honor this day , let that hundred go back to Washington and gather four hundred more , and together , pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year . That is how we honor those on this bridge . Of course , our democracy is not the task of Congress alone , or the courts alone , or even the President alone . If every new voter suppression law was struck down today , we would still have , here in America , one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples . Fifty years ago , registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar , the number of bubbles on a bar of soap . It meant risking your dignity , and sometimes , your life . What is our excuse today for not voting How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought How do we so fully give away our power , our voice , in shaping America s future Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places We give away our power . Fellow marchers , so much has changed in 50 years . We have endured war and we have fashioned peace . We have seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives . We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have scarcely imagined . But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship that willingness of a 26 year old deacon , or a Unitarian minister , or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that they had risk everything to realize its promise . That is what it means to love America . That is what it means to believe in America . That is what it means when we say America is exceptional . For we were born of change . We broke the old aristocracies , declaring ourselves entitled not by bloodline , but endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights . We secure our rights and responsibilities through a system of self government , of and by and for the people . That is why we argue and fight with so much passion and conviction because we know our efforts matter . We know America is what we make of it . Look at our history . We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea , pioneers who braved the unfamiliar , followed by a stampede of farmers and miners , and entrepreneurs and hucksters . That is our spirit . That is who we are . We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer , women who could do as much as any man and then some . And we are Susan Anthony , who shook the system until the law reflected that truth . That is our character . We are the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores , the huddled masses yearning to breathe free Holocaust survivors , Soviet defectors , the Lost Boys of Sudan . We are the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande because we want our kids to know a better life . That is how we came to be . We are the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South . We are the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up the West , and countless laborers who laid rail , and raised skyscrapers , and organized for workers rights . We are the fresh faced GIs who fought to liberate a continent . And we are the Tuskeegee Airmen , and the Navajo code talkers , and the Japanese Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied . We are the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on 9 11 , the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq . We are the gay Americans whose blood ran in the streets of San Francisco and New York , just as blood ran down this bridge . We are storytellers , writers , poets , artists who abhor unfairness , and despise hypocrisy , and give voice to the voiceless , and tell truths that need to be told . We are the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues , bluegrass and country , and hip hop and rock and roll , and our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom . We are Jackie Robinson , enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head , and stealing home in the World Series anyway . We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who build our temples for tomorrow , strong as we know how . We are the people Emerson wrote of , who for truth and honor s sake stand fast and suffer long who are never tired , so long as we can see far enough . That is what America is . Not stock photos or airbrushed history , or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others . We respect the past , but we do not pine for the past . We do not fear the future we grab for it . America is not some fragile thing . We are large , in the words of Whitman , containing multitudes . We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy , perpetually young in spirit . That is why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 could lead a mighty march . And that is what the young people here today and listening all across the country must take away from this day . You are America . Unconstrained by habit and convention . Unencumbered by what is , because you are ready to seize what ought to be . For everywhere in this country , there are first steps to be taken , there is new ground to cover , there are more bridges to be crossed . And it is you , the young and fearless at heart , the most diverse and educated generation in our history , who the nation is waiting to follow . Because Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person . Because the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word We . We The People . We Shall Overcome . Yes We Can . That word is owned by no one . It belongs to everyone . Oh , what a glorious task we are given , to continually try to improve this great nation of ours . Fifty years from Bloody Sunday , our march is not yet finished , but we are getting closer . Two hundred and thirty nine years after this nation s founding our union is not yet perfect , but we are getting closer . Our job s easier because somebody already got us through that first mile . Somebody already got us over that bridge . When it feels the road is too hard , when the torch we have been passed feels too heavy , we will remember these early travelers , and draw strength from their example , and hold firmly the words of the prophet Isaiah Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength . They will soar on wings like eagles . They will run and not grow weary . They will walk and not be faint . We honor those who walked so we could run . We must run so our children soar . And we will not grow weary . For we believe in the power of an awesome God , and we believe in this country s sacred promise . May He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us , and bless the United States of America . Thank you , everybody .<speech_sep>
