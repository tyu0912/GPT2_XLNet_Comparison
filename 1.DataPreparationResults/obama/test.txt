Hello , Connecticut . Thank you . Well , thank you so much , everybody . Let me begin by thanking Nicole , and Ian , for your brave words . I want to thank them and all the Newtown families who have come here today , including your First Selectman , Pat Llodra . Nobody could be more eloquent than Nicole and the other families on this issue . And we are so grateful for their courage and willingness to share their stories again and again , understanding that nothing is going to be more important in making sure the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them . I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well the survivors THE PRESIDENT I love you back . I do . the survivors who still mourn and grieve , but are still going to work every day to love and raise those precious children in their care as fiercely as ever . I want to thank Governor Malloy for his leadership . Very proud of him . I want to thank the University of Hartford for hosting us this afternoon . Thank you , Hawks . And I want to thank the people of Connecticut for everything you have done to honor the memories of the victims because you are part of their family as well . One of your recent alumni , Rachel D Avino , was a behavioral therapist at Sandy Hook . Two alumni of your performing arts school , Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez Greene , lost their daughter , Ana an incredible , vibrant young girl who looked up to them , and learned from them , and inherited their talents by singing before she could talk . So every family in this state was shaken by the tragedy of that morning . Every family in this country was shaken . We hugged our kids more tightly . We asked what could we do , as a society , to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again . And as a society , we decided that we have to change . We must . We must change . I noticed that Nicole and others refer to that day as 12 14 . For these families , it was a day that changed everything . And I know many of you in Newtown wondered if the rest of us would live up to the promise we made in those dark days if we had change , too or if once the television trucks left , once the candles flickered out , once the teddy bears were carefully gathered up , that the country would somehow move on to other things . Over the weekend , I heard Francine Wheeler , who lost her son Ben that day , say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some , but for her , it feels like it is been years since she saw Ben . And she is determined not to let what happened that day just fade away . We are not going anywhere , she said . We are here . And we are going to be here . And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown , everybody who was impacted . And , Newtown , we want you to know that we are here with you . We will not walk away from the promises we have made . We are as determined as ever to do what must be done . In fact , I am here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done . We are not forgetting . We cannot forget . Your families still grieve in ways most of us cannot comprehend . But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference not just to honor your own children , but to protect the lives of all of our children . So many of you have mobilized , and organized , and petitioned your elected officials with love and logic , as Nicole put it as citizens determined to right something gone wrong . And last week , here in Connecticut , your elected leaders responded . The Connecticut legislature , led by many of the legislators here today , passed new measures to protect more of our children and our communities from gun violence . And Governor Malloy signed that legislation into law . So I want to be clear . You , the families of Newtown , people across Connecticut , you helped make that happen . Your voices , your determination made that happen . Obviously , the elected leaders did an extraordinary job moving it forward , but it could not have happened if they were not hearing from people in their respective districts , people all across the state . That is the power of your voice . And , by the way , Connecticut is not alone . In the past few months , New York , Colorado , Maryland have all passed new , common sense gun safety reforms as well . These are all states that share an awful familiarity with gun violence , whether it is the horror of mass killings , or the street crime that is too common in too many neighborhoods . All of these states also share a strong tradition of hunting , and sport shooting , and gun ownership . It is been a part of the fabric of people s lives for generations . And every single one of those states including here in Connecticut decided that , yes , we can protect more of our citizens from gun violence while still protecting our Second Amendment rights . Those two things do not contradict each other . We can pass common sense laws that protect our kids and protect our rights . So Connecticut has shown the way . And now is the time for Congress to do the same . Now is the time for Congress to do the same . This week is the time for Congress to do the same . Now , back in January , just a few months after the tragedy in Newtown , I announced a series of executive actions to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe . And I put forward common sense proposals much like those that passed here in Connecticut for Congress to consider . And you will remember in my State of the Union address , I urged Congress to give those proposals a vote . And that moment is now . As soon as this week , Congress will begin debating these common sense proposals to reduce gun violence . Your senators , Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy they are here your Representatives , John Larson , Rosa DeLauro , Elizabeth Esty , Jim Hines , Joe Courtney , they are all pushing to pass this legislation . But much of Congress is going to only act if they hear from you , the American people . So here s what we have to do . I appreciate that . Here s what we have got to do . We have to tell Congress it is time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others cannot get their hands on a gun . Let us make that happen . We have to tell Congress it is time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folks will think twice before buying a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who will not pass a background check . Let us get that done . We have to tell Congress it is time to restore the ban on military style assault weapons , and a 10 round limit for magazines , to make it harder for a gunman to fire 154 bullets into his victims in less than five minutes . Let us put that to a vote . We have to tell Congress it is time to strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment they need before it is too late . Let us do that for our kids and for our communities . Now , I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others , but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people . All of them are common sense . All of them deserve a vote . All of them deserve a vote . Consider background checks . Over the past 20 years , background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun . A group of police officers in Colorado told me last week that , thanks to background checks , they have been able to stop convicted murderers , folks under restraining orders for committing violent domestic abuse from buying a gun . In some cases , they have actually arrested the person as they were coming to purchase the gun . So we know that background checks can work . But the problem is loopholes in the current law let so many people avoid background checks altogether . That is not safe . It does not make sense . If you are a law abiding citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun , would not you expect other people to play by the same rules If you are a law abiding gun seller , would not you want to know you are not selling your gun to someone who is likely to commit a crime Should not we make it harder , not easier for somebody who is convicted of domestic abuse to get his hands on a gun It turns out 90 percent of Americans think so . Ninety percent of Americans support universal background checks . Think about that . How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything And yet , 90 percent agree on this Republicans , Democrats , folks who own guns , folks who do not own guns 80 percent of Republicans , more than 80 percent of gun owners , more than 70 percent of NRA households . It is common sense . And yet , there is only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on , and that is politics in Washington . You would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to make this happen . That is what you would think . If our democracy is working the way it is supposed to , and 90 percent of the American people agree on something , in the wake of a tragedy you had think this would not be a heavy lift . And yet , some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms . Think about that . They are not just saying they will vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support . They are saying they will do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions . They are saying your opinion does not matter . And that is not right . That is not right . We need a vote . We need a vote . Now , I have also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me . Connecticut , this is not about me . This is not about politics . This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence . It is about them and all the families going forward , so we can prevent this from happening again . That is what it is about . It is about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk . That is what this is about . This is not about politics . This is not about politics . This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let us make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down . When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote that families of Newtown , and Aurora , and Tucson , and a former member of Congress , Gabby Giffords , that they all deserved a vote virtually every member of that chamber stood up and applauded . And now they are going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do You deserve better than that . You deserve a vote . Now , look , we knew from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy . We knew that there would be powerful interests that are very good at confusing the subject , that are good at amplifying conflict and extremes , that are good at drowning out rational debate , good at ginning up irrational fears , all of which stands in the way of progress . But if our history teaches us anything , then it is up to us the people to stand up to those who say we cannot , or we will not stand up for the change that we need . And I believe that that is what the American people are looking for . When I first ran for this office , I said that I did not believe the country was as divided as our politics would suggest , and I still believe that . I know sometimes , when you watch cable news or talk radio , or you browse the Internet , you had think , man , everybody just hates each other , everybody is just at each other s throats . But that is not how most Americans think about these issues . There are good people on both sides of every issue . So if we are going to move forward , we cannot just talk past one another . We have got to listen to one another . That is what Governor Malloy and all these legislative leaders did . That is why they were able to pass bipartisan legislation . I have got stacks of letters from gun owners who want me to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arms , do not want them infringed upon , and I appreciate every one of those letters . I have learned from them . But a lot of those letters , what they have also said is they are not just gun owners they are also parents or police officers or veterans , and they agree that we cannot stand by and keep letting these tragedies happen that with our rights come some responsibilities and obligations to our communities and ourselves , and most of all to our children . We cannot just think about us we have got to think about we , the people . I was in Colorado . I told a story about Michelle . She came back from a trip to rural Iowa we were out there campaigning . Sometimes it would be miles between farms , let alone towns . And she said , you know , coming back , I can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection . If somebody drove up into the driveway and , Barack , you were not home , the sheriff lived miles away , I might want that security . So she can understand what it might be like in terms of somebody wanting that kind of security . On the other hand , I also talked to a hunter last week who said , all my experiences with guns have been positive , but I also realize that for others , all their experiences with guns have been negative . And when he said that , I thought about the mom I met from suburban Chicago whose son was killed in a random shooting . And this mom told me , I hate it when people tell me that my son was in the wrong place at the wrong time . He was on his way to school . He was exactly where he was supposed to be . He was in the right place at the right time , and he still got shot . The kids at Sandy Hook were where they were supposed to be . So were those moviegoers in Aurora . So were those worshippers in Oak Creek . So was Gabby Giffords . She was at a supermarket , listening to the concerns of her constituents . They were exactly where they were supposed to be . They were also exercising their rights to assemble peaceably to worship freely and safely . They were exercising the rights of life and liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . So surely , we can reconcile those two things . Surely , America does not have to be divided between rural and urban , and Democrat and Republican when it comes to something like this . If you are an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known , then we have to act . Now is the time to get engaged . Now is the time to get involved . Now is the time to push back on fear , and frustration , and misinformation . Now is the time for everybody to make their voices heard from every state house to the corridors of Congress . And I am asking everyone listening today , find out where your member of Congress stands on this . If they are not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks , then ask them , why not Why would not you want to make it easier for law enforcement to do their job Why would not you want to make it harder for a dangerous person to get his or her hands on a gun What is more important to you our children , or an A grade from the gun lobby I have heard Nicole talk about what her life has been like since Dylan was taken from her in December . And one thing she said struck me . She said , Every night , I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again . And during the day , I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change . Now , if Nicole can summon the courage to do that , how can the rest of us do any less How can we do any less If there is even one thing we can do to protect our kids , do not we have an obligation to try If there is even one step we can take to keep somebody from murdering dozens of innocents in the span of minutes , should not we be taking that step If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child , is not that worth fighting for I have got to tell you , I have had tough days in the presidency I have said this before . The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my presidency . But I have got to tell you , if we do not respond to this , that will be a tough day for me , too . Because we have got to expect more from ourselves , and we have got to expect more from Congress . We have got to believe that every once in a while , we set politics aside and we just do what is right . We have got to believe that . And if you believe that , I am asking you to stand up . If you believe in the right to bears arms , like I do , but think we should prevent an irresponsible few from inflicting harm stand up . Stand up . If you believe that the families of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Virginia Tech and the thousands of Americans who have been gunned down in the last four months deserve a vote , we all have to stand up . If you want the people you send to Washington to have just an iota of the courage that the educators at Sandy Hook showed when danger arrived on their doorstep , then we are all going to have to stand up . And if we do , if we come together and raise our voices together and demand this change together , I am convinced cooperation and common sense will prevail . We will find sensible , intelligent ways to make this country stronger and safer for our children . So let us do the right thing . Let us do right by our kids . Let us do right by these families . Let us get this done . Connecticut , thank you . God bless you . God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you , Governor . To all the families , first responders , to the community of Newtown , clergy , guests Scripture tells us hellip do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away hellip inwardly we are being renewed day by day . For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all . So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal . For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , an eternal house in heaven , not built by human hands . We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults . They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America . Here in Newtown , I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation . I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow , nor can they heal your wounded hearts . I can only hope it helps for you to know that you are not alone in your grief that our world too has been torn apart that all across this land of ours , we have wept with you , we have pulled our children tight . And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide , we will provide whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load , we will gladly bear it . Newtown you are not alone . As these difficult days have unfolded , you have also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice . We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary , the school s staff did not flinch , they did not hesitate . Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach , Vicki Soto , Lauren Rousseau , Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances with courage and with love , giving their lives to protect the children in their care . We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms , and kept steady through it all , and reassured their students by saying wait for the good guys , they are coming show me your smile . And we know that good guys came . The first responders who raced to the scene , helping to guide those in harm s way to safety , and comfort those in need , holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do , and others needed them more . And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren , helping one another , holding each other , dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do one child even trying to encourage a grown up by saying , I know karate . So it is okay . I will lead the way out . As a community , you have inspired us , Newtown . In the face of indescribable violence , in the face of unconscionable evil , you have looked out for each other , and you have cared for one another , and you have loved one another . This is how Newtown will be remembered . And with time , and God s grace , that love will see you through . But we , as a nation , we are left with some hard questions . Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time , walking around . With their very first cry , this most precious , vital part of ourselves our child is suddenly exposed to the world , to possible mishap or malice . And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm . And yet , we also know that with that child s very first step , and each step after that , they are separating from us that we will not that we cannot always be there for them . They will suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments . And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self reliant and capable and resilient , ready to face the world without fear . And we know we cannot do this by ourselves . It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize , no matter how much you love these kids , you cannot do it by yourself . That this job of keeping our children safe , and teaching them well , is something we can only do together , with the help of friends and neighbors , the help of a community , and the help of a nation . And in that way , we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we are counting on everybody else to help look after ours that we are all parents that they are all our children . This is our first task caring for our children . It is our first job . If we do not get that right , we do not get anything right . That is how , as a society , we will be judged . And by that measure , can we truly say , as a nation , that we are meeting our obligations Can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our children all of them safe from harm Can we claim , as a nation , that we are all together there , letting them know that they are loved , and teaching them to love in return Can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose I have been reflecting on this the last few days , and if we are honest with ourselves , the answer is no . We are not doing enough . And we will have to change . Since I have been President , this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting . The fourth time we have hugged survivors . The fourth time we have consoled the families of victims . And in between , there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country , almost daily reports of victims , many of them children , in small towns and big cities all across America victims whose much of the time , their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time . We cannot tolerate this anymore . These tragedies must end . And to end them , we must change . We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex , and that is true . No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world , or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society . But that cannot be an excuse for inaction . Surely , we can do better than this . If there is even one step we can take to save another child , or another parent , or another town , from the grief that has visited Tucson , and Aurora , and Oak Creek , and Newtown , and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that then surely we have an obligation to try . In the coming weeks , I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this . Because what choice do we have We cannot accept events like this as routine . Are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage , that the politics are too hard Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom All the world s religions so many of them represented here today start with a simple question Why are we here What gives our life meaning What gives our acts purpose We know our time on this Earth is fleeting . We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain that even after we chase after some earthly goal , whether it is wealth or power or fame , or just simple comfort , we will , in some fashion , fall short of what we had hoped . We know that no matter how good our intentions , we will all stumble sometimes , in some way . We will make mistakes , we will experience hardships . And even when we are trying to do the right thing , we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness , so often unable to discern God s heavenly plans . There is only one thing we can be sure of , and that is the love that we have for our children , for our families , for each other . The warmth of a small child s embrace that is true . The memories we have of them , the joy that they bring , the wonder we see through their eyes , that fierce and boundless love we feel for them , a love that takes us out of ourselves , and binds us to something larger we know that is what matters . We know we are always doing right when we are taking care of them , when we are teaching them well , when we are showing acts of kindness . We do not go wrong when we do that . That is what we can be sure of . And that is what you , the people of Newtown , have reminded us . That is how you have inspired us . You remind us what matters . And that is what should drive us forward in everything we do , for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth . Let the little children come to me , Jesus said , and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven . Charlotte . Daniel . Olivia . Josephine . Ana . Dylan . Madeleine . Catherine . Chase . Jesse . James . Grace . Emilie . Jack . Noah . Caroline . Jessica . Benjamin . Avielle . Allison . God has called them all home . For those of us who remain , let us find the strength to carry on , and make our country worthy of their memory . May God bless and keep those we have lost in His heavenly place . May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort . And may He bless and watch over this community , and the United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of Congress , fellow citizens Fifty one years ago , John Kennedy declared to this chamber that the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress . It is my task , he said , to report the State of the Union to improve it is the task of us all . Tonight , thanks to the grit and determination of the American people , there is much progress to report . After a decade of grinding war , our brave men and women in uniform are coming home . After years of grueling recession , our businesses have created over six million new jobs . We buy more American cars than we have in five years , and less foreign oil than we have in 20 . Our housing market is healing , our stock market is rebounding , and consumers , patients , and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before . So , together , we have cleared away the rubble of crisis , and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger . But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded . Our economy is adding jobs but too many people still cannot find full time employment . Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all time highs but for more than a decade , wages and incomes have barely budged . It is our generation s task , then , to reignite the true engine of America s economic growth a rising , thriving middle class . It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities , you can get ahead , no matter where you come from , no matter what you look like , or who you love . It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many , and not just the few that it encourages free enterprise , rewards individual initiative , and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation . The American people do not expect government to solve every problem . They do not expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue . But they do expect us to put the nation s interests before party . They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can . For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together , and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all . Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery . Over the last few years , both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than 2 . 5 trillion mostly through spending cuts , but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans . As a result , we are more than halfway towards the goal of 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances . Now we need to finish the job . And the question is , how In 2011 , Congress passed a law saying that if both parties could not agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal , about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year . These sudden , harsh , arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness . They had devastate priorities like education , and energy , and medical research . They would certainly slow our recovery , and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs . That is why Democrats , Republicans , business leaders , and economists have already said that these cuts , known here in Washington as the sequester , are a really bad idea . Now , some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training , Medicare and Social Security benefits . That idea is even worse . Yes , the biggest driver of our long term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population . And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms otherwise , our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children , and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations . But we cannot ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful . We will not grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling , or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters . Most Americans Democrats , Republicans , and independents understand that we cannot just cut our way to prosperity . They know that broad based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction , with spending cuts and revenue , and with everybody doing their fair share . And that is the approach I offer tonight . On Medicare , I am prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson Bowles commission . Already , the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs . And the reforms I am proposing go even further . We will reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors . We will bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare , because our medical bills should not be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive . And I am open to additional reforms from both parties , so long as they do not violate the guarantee of a secure retirement . Our government should not make promises we cannot keep but we must keep the promises we have already made . To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target , we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested , and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well off and the well connected . After all , why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks How is that fair Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes How does that promote growth Now is our best chance for bipartisan , comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit . We can get this done . The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms , and more time expanding and hiring a tax code that ensures billionaires with high powered accountants cannot work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas , and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America . That is what tax reform can deliver . That is what we can do together . I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy . The politics will be hard for both sides . None of us will get 100 percent of what we want . But the alternative will cost us jobs , hurt our economy , visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans . So let us set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future . And let us do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors . The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next . We cannot do it . Let us agree right here , right now to keep the people s government open , and pay our bills on time , and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America . The American people have worked too hard , for too long , rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another . Now , most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda . But let us be clear , deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan . A growing economy that creates good , middle class jobs that must be the North Star that guides our efforts . Every day , we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation How do we attract more jobs to our shores How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living A year and a half ago , I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs . And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda . I urge this Congress to pass the rest . But tonight , I will lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago . Let me repeat nothing I am proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime . It is not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad based growth . That is what we should be looking for . Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing . After shedding jobs for more than 10 years , our manufacturers have added about 500 , 000 jobs over the past three . Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan . Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico . And this year , Apple will start making Macs in America again . There are things we can do , right now , to accelerate this trend . Last year , we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown , Ohio . A once shuttered warehouse is now a state of the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything . There is no reason this cannot happen in other towns . So tonight , I am announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs , where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high tech jobs . And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America . We can get that done . Now , if we want to make the best products , we also have to invest in the best ideas . Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned 140 to our economy every dollar . Today , our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer s . They are developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful . Now is not the time to gut these job creating investments in science and innovation . Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race . We need to make those investments . Today , no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy . After years of talking about it , we are finally poised to control our own energy future . We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years . We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas , and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it . We produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone s energy bill is lower because of it . And over the last four years , our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen . But for the sake of our children and our future , we must do more to combat climate change . Now , it is true that no single event makes a trend . But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 . Heat waves , droughts , wildfires , floods all are now more frequent and more intense . We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence . Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it is too late . Now , the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth . I urge this Congress to get together , pursue a bipartisan , market based solution to climate change , like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago . But if Congress will not act soon to protect future generations , I will . I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy . Four years ago , other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it . And we have begun to change that . Last year , wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America . So let us generate even more . Solar energy gets cheaper by the year let us drive down costs even further . As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy , so must we . Now , in the meantime , the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence . We need to encourage that . And that is why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits . That is got to be part of an all of the above plan . But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water . In fact , much of our new found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we , the public , own together . So tonight , I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good . If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea , then so can we . Let us take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we have put up with for far too long . I am also issuing a new goal for America Let us cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years . We will work with the states to do it . Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen . America s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair . Ask any CEO where they had rather locate and hire a country with deteriorating roads and bridges , or one with high speed rail and Internet high tech schools , self healing power grids . The CEO of Siemens America a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina said that if we upgrade our infrastructure , they will bring even more jobs . And that is the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world . And I know you want these job creating projects in your district . I have seen all those ribbon cuttings . So tonight , I propose a Fix It First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs , like the nearly 70 , 000 structurally deficient bridges across the country . And to make sure taxpayers do not shoulder the whole burden , I am also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most modern ports to move our goods , modern pipelines to withstand a storm , modern schools worthy of our children . Let us prove that there is no better place to do business than here in the United States of America , and let us start right away . We can get this done . And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector . The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007 . Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years . Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent , and construction is expanding again . But even with mortgage rates near a 50 year low , too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected . Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no . That is holding our entire economy back . We need to fix it . Right now , there is a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save 3 , 000 a year by refinancing at today s rates . Democrats and Republicans have supported it before , so what are we waiting for Take a vote , and send me that bill . Why would we be against that Why would that be a partisan issue , helping folks refinance Right now , overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home . What is holding us back Let us streamline the process , and help our economy grow . These initiatives in manufacturing , energy , infrastructure , housing all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs . But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs . And that has to start at the earliest possible age . Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning , the better he or she does down the road . But today , fewer than 3 in 10 four year olds are enrolled in a high quality preschool program . Most middle class parents cannot afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool . And for poor kids who need help the most , this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives . So tonight , I propose working with states to make high quality preschool available to every single child in America . That is something we should be able to do . Every dollar we invest in high quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on by boosting graduation rates , reducing teen pregnancy , even reducing violent crime . In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children , like Georgia or Oklahoma , studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level , graduate high school , hold a job , form more stable families of their own . We know this works . So let us do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind . Let us give our kids that chance . Let us also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job . Right now , countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges . So those German kids , they are ready for a job when they graduate high school . They have been trained for the jobs that are there . Now at schools like P Tech in Brooklyn , a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBstudents will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate s degree in computers or engineering . We need to give every American student opportunities like this . And four years ago , we started Race to the Top a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards , all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year . Tonight , I am announcing a new challenge to redesign America s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high tech economy . And we will reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers , and create classes that focus on science , technology , engineering and math the skills today s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future . Now , even with better high schools , most young people will need some higher education . It is a simple fact the more education you have got , the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class . But today , skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education , or saddle them with unsustainable debt . Through tax credits , grants and better loans , we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years . But taxpayers cannot keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education . Colleges must do their part to keep costs down , and it is our job to make sure that they do . So tonight , I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid . And tomorrow , my administration will release a new College Scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria where you can get the most bang for your educational buck . Now , to grow our middle class , our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today s jobs require . But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who is willing to work everybody who is willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead . Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving , hopeful immigrants . And right now , leaders from the business , labor , law enforcement , faith communities they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform . Now is the time to do it . Now is the time to get it done . Now is the time to get it done . Real reform means strong border security , and we can build on the progress my administration has already made putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years . Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship a path that includes passing a background check , paying taxes and a meaningful penalty , learning English , and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally . And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy . In other words , we know what needs to be done . And as we speak , bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill , and I applaud their efforts . So let us get this done . Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months , and I will sign it right away . And America will be better for it . Let us get it done . Let us get it done . But we cannot stop there . We know our economy is stronger when our wives , our mothers , our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace , and free from the fear of domestic violence . Today , the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago . And I now urge the House to do the same . Good job , Joe . And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts , and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year . We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day s work with honest wages . But today , a full time worker making the minimum wage earns 14 , 500 a year . Even with the tax relief we put in place , a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line . That is wrong . That is why , since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage , 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher . Tonight , let us declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth , no one who works full time should have to live in poverty , and raise the federal minimum wage to 9 . 00 an hour . We should be able to get that done . This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families . It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank rent or eviction scraping by or finally getting ahead . For businesses across the country , it would mean customers with more money in their pockets . And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government . In fact , working folks should not have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher . So here s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year let us tie the minimum wage to the cost of living , so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on . Tonight , let us also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work , it is virtually impossible to get ahead . Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up . Inescapable pockets of poverty , urban and rural , where young adults are still fighting for their first job . America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny . And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them . Let us offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who have got what it takes to fill that job opening , but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore . Let us put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run down neighborhoods . And this year , my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet . We will work with local leaders to target resources at public safety , and education , and housing . We will give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest . And we will work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low income couples , and do more to encourage fatherhood because what makes you a man is not the ability to conceive a child it is having the courage to raise one . And we want to encourage that . We want to help that . Stronger families . Stronger communities . A stronger America . It is this kind of prosperity broad , shared , built on a thriving middle class that has always been the source of our progress at home . It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world . Tonight , we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us . Because of them , we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda . Already , we have brought home 33 , 000 of our brave servicemen and women . This spring , our forces will move into a support role , while Afghan security forces take the lead . Tonight , I can announce that over the next year , another 34 , 000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan . This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year , our war in Afghanistan will be over . Beyond 2014 , America s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure , but the nature of our commitment will change . We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates . Today , the organization that attacked us on 9 11 is a shadow of its former self . It is true , different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa . The threat these groups pose is evolving . But to meet this threat , we do not need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations . Instead , we will need to help countries like Yemen , and Libya , and Somalia provide for their own security , and help allies who take the fight to terrorists , as we have in Mali . And where necessary , through a range of capabilities , we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans . Now , as we do , we must enlist our values in the fight . That is why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts . Throughout , we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts . I recognize that in our democracy , no one should just take my word for it that we are doing things the right way . So in the months ahead , I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting , detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances , but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world . Of course , our challenges do not end with al Qaeda . America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world s most dangerous weapons . The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations . Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them , as we stand by our allies , strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats . Likewise , the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution , because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations , and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon . At the same time , we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals , and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations . America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks . Now , we know hackers steal people s identities and infiltrate private emails . We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets . Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid , our financial institutions , our air traffic control systems . We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy . And that is why , earlier today , I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing , and developing standards to protect our national security , our jobs , and our privacy . But now Congress must act as well , by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks . This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis . Now , even as we protect our people , we should remember that today s world presents not just dangers , not just threats , it presents opportunities . To boost American exports , support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia , we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans Pacific Partnership . And tonight , I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good paying American jobs . We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all not only because it creates new markets , more stable order in certain regions of the world , but also because it is the right thing to do . In many places , people live on little more than a dollar a day . So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy by empowering women by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve , and helping communities to feed , and power , and educate themselves by saving the world s children from preventable deaths and by realizing the promise of an AIDS free generation , which is within our reach . You see , America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change . I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon , in Burma , when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years when thousands of Burmese lined the streets , waving American flags , including a man who said , There is justice and law in the United States . I want our country to be like that . In defense of freedom , we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa from Europe to Asia . In the Middle East , we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights , and support stable transitions to democracy . We know the process will be messy , and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt , but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people . We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people , and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian . And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace . These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month . And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk our diplomats , our intelligence officers , and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces . As long as I am Commander in Chief , we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad , and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known . We will invest in new capabilities , even as we reduce waste and wartime spending . We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers , and equal benefits for their families gay and straight . We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms , because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat . We will keep faith with our veterans , investing in world class care , including mental health care , for our wounded warriors supporting our military families giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned . And I want to thank my wife , Michelle , and Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us . Thank you , honey . Thank you , Jill . Defending our freedom , though , is not just the job of our military alone . We must all do our part to make sure our God given rights are protected here at home . That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote . When any American , no matter where they live or what their party , are denied that right because they cannot afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot , we are betraying our ideals . So tonight , I am announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America . And it definitely needs improvement . I am asking two long time experts in the field who , by the way , recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney s campaign to lead it . We can fix this , and we will . The American people demand it , and so does our democracy . Of course , what I have said tonight matters little if we do not come together to protect our most precious resource our children . It has been two months since Newtown . I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence . But this time is different . Overwhelming majorities of Americans Americans who believe in the Second Amendment have come together around common sense reform , like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun . Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals . Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets , because these police chiefs , they are tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned . Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress . Now , if you want to vote no , that is your choice . But these proposals deserve a vote . Because in the two months since Newtown , more than a thousand birthdays , graduations , anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun more than a thousand . One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton . She was 15 years old . She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss . She was a majorette . She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend . Just three weeks ago , she was here , in Washington , with her classmates , performing for her country at my inauguration . And a week later , she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school , just a mile away from my house . Hadiya s parents , Nate and Cleo , are in this chamber tonight , along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence . They deserve a vote . They deserve a vote . Gabby Giffords deserves a vote . The families of Newtown deserve a vote . The families of Aurora deserve a vote . The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg , and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote . They deserve a simple vote . Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country . In fact , no laws , no initiatives , no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I have outlined tonight . But we were never sent here to be perfect . We were sent here to make what difference we can , to secure this nation , expand opportunity , uphold our ideals through the hard , often frustrating , but absolutely necessary work of self government . We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another , every single day , usually without fanfare , all across this country . We should follow their example . We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez . When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness , she was not thinking about how her own home was faring . Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe . We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor . When Desiline arrived at her polling place , she was told the wait to vote might be six hours . And as time ticked by , her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet , but whether folks like her would get to have their say . And hour after hour , a throng of people stayed in line to support her because Desiline is 102 years old . And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read , I voted . We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy . When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive , he did not consider his own safety . He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside , even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds . And when asked how he did that , Brian said , That is just the way we are made . That is just the way we are made . We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms , and hold different views than the person beside us . But as Americans , we all share the same proud title we are citizens . It is a word that does not just describe our nationality or legal status . It describes the way we are made . It describes what we believe . It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations , that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others and that well into our third century as a nation , it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these United States , to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story . Thank you . God bless you , and God bless these United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans Today in America , a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it , and did her part to lift America s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades . An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup , and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years . An autoworker fine tuned some of the best , most fuel efficient cars in the world , and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil . A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five year stretch of farm exports in our history . A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford . A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift , bone tired but dreaming big dreams for his son . And in tight knit communities across America , fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids , put an arm around their spouse , remember fallen comrades , and give thanks for being home from a war that , after twelve long years , is finally coming to an end . Tonight , this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you , our citizens , who make the state of our union strong . Here are the results of your efforts The lowest unemployment rate in over five years . A rebounding housing market . A manufacturing sector that is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s . More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time that is happened in nearly twenty years . Our deficits cut by more than half . And for the first time in over a decade , business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world s number one place to invest America is . That is why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America . After five years of grit and determined effort , the United States is better positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth . The question for everyone in this chamber , running through every decision we make this year , is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress . For several years now , this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government . It is an important debate one that dates back to our very founding . But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States then we are not doing right by the American people . As President , I am committed to making Washington work better , and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here . I believe most of you are , too . Last month , thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans , this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year s severe cuts to priorities like education . Nobody got everything they wanted , and we can still do more to invest in this country s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way . But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs , not creating new crises . In the coming months , let us see where else we can make progress together . Let us make this a year of action . That is what most Americans want for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations . And what I believe unites the people of this nation , regardless of race or region or party , young or old , rich or poor , is the simple , profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility , you can get ahead . Let us face it that belief has suffered some serious blows . Over more than three decades , even before the Great Recession hit , massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good , middle class jobs , and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on . Today , after four years of economic growth , corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher , and those at the top have never done better . But average wages have barely budged . Inequality has deepened . Upward mobility has stalled . The cold , hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery , too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by let alone get ahead . And too many still are not working at all . Our job is to reverse these trends . It will not happen right away , and we will not agree on everything . But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete , practical proposals to speed up growth , strengthen the middle class , and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class . Some require Congressional action , and I am eager to work with all of you . But America does not stand still and neither will So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families , that is what I am going to do . As usual , our First Lady sets a good example . Michelle s Let us Move partnership with schools , businesses , and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come . The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400 , 000 veterans and military spouses . Taking a page from that playbook , the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already , 150 universities , businesses , and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus . Across the country , we are partnering with mayors , governors , and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality . The point is , there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments , and are moving this country forward . They believe , and I believe , that here in America , our success should depend not on accident of birth , but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams . That is what drew our forebears here . It is how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America s largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth . Opportunity is who we are . And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise . We know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job . With the economy picking up speed , companies say they intend to hire more people this year . And over half of big manufacturers say they are thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad . So let us make that decision easier for more companies . Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful , complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here , and reward companies that keep profits abroad . Let us flip that equation . Let us work together to close those loopholes , end those incentives to ship jobs overseas , and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home . Moreover , we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads , upgrading our ports , unclogging our commutes because in today s global economy , first class jobs gravitate to first class infrastructure . We will need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer . But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects , so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible . We also have the chance , right now , to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high tech manufacturing jobs . My administration has launched two hubs for high tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown , where we have connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies . Tonight , I am announcing we will launch six more this year . Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create . So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work . Let us do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America . Over the past five years , my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other . And when ninety eight percent of our exporters are small businesses , new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia Pacific will help them create more jobs . We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers , protect our environment , and open new markets to new goods stamped Made in the USA . China and Europe are not standing on the sidelines . Neither should we . We know that the nation that goes all in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow . This is an edge America cannot surrender . Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones . That is why Congress should undo the damage done by last year s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery whether it is vaccines that stay ahead of drug resistant bacteria , or paper thin material that is stronger than steel . And let us pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation , not costly , needless litigation . Now , one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy . The all of the above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working , and today , America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades . One of the reasons why is natural gas if extracted safely , it is the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change . Businesses plan to invest almost 100 billion in new factories that use natural gas . I will cut red tape to help states get those factories built , and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas . My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air , our water , and our communities . And while we are at it , I will use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations . It is not just oil and natural gas production that is booming we are becoming a global leader in solar , too . Every four minutes , another American home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be outsourced . Let us continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving 4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that do not need it , so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do . And even as we have increased energy production , we have partnered with businesses , builders , and local communities to reduce the energy we consume . When we rescued our automakers , for example , we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars . In the coming months , I will build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks , so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump . Taken together , our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner , safer planet . Over the past eight years , the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth . But we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought , and coastal cities dealing with floods . That is why I directed my administration to work with states , utilities , and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air . The shift to a cleaner energy economy will not happen overnight , and it will require tough choices along the way . But the debate is settled . Climate change is a fact . And when our children s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer , more stable world , with new sources of energy , I want us to be able to sayyes , we did . Finally , if we are serious about economic growth , it is time to heed the call of business leaders , labor leaders , faith leaders , and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted . I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same . Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades . And for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreams to study , invent , and contribute to our culture they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone . So let us get immigration reform done this year . The ideas I have outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs . But in this rapidly changing economy , we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs . The good news is , we know how to do it . Two years ago , as the auto industry came roaring back , Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit . She knew that Ford needed parts for the best selling truck in America , and she knew how to make them . She just needed the workforce . So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job , or better job . She was flooded with new workers . And today , Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees . What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker . So tonight , I have asked Vice President Biden to lead an across the board reform of America s training programs to make sure they have one mission train Americans with the skills employers need , and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now . That means more on the job training , and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life . It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs . And if Congress wants to help , you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready to work Americans with ready to be filled jobs . I am also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it is more effective in today s economy . But first , this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1 . 6 million people . Let me tell you why . Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys . She had been steadily employed since she was a teenager . She put herself through college . She had never collected unemployment benefits . In May , she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home . A week later , budget cuts claimed the job she loved . Last month , when their unemployment insurance was cut off , she sat down and wrote me a letter the kind I get every day . We are the face of the unemployment crisis , she wrote . I am not dependent on the government hellip Our country depends on people like us who build careers , contribute to society hellip care about our neighbors hellip I am confident that in time I will find a job hellip I will pay my taxes , and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love . Please give us this chance . Congress , give these hardworking , responsible Americans that chance . They need our help , but more important , this country needs them in the game . That is why I have been asking CEOs to give more long term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week , many will come to the White House to make that commitment real . Tonight , I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same because we are stronger when America fields a full team . Of course , it is not enough to train today s workforce . We also have to prepare tomorrow s workforce , by guaranteeing every child access to a world class education . Estiven Rodriguez could not speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine . But last month , thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program , he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office , where they mailed off their college applications . And this son of a factory worker just found out he is going to college this fall . Five years ago , we set out to change the odds for all our kids . We worked with lenders to reform student loans , and today , more young people are earning college degrees than ever before . Race to the Top , with the help of governors from both parties , has helped states raise expectations and performance . Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington , are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy problem solving , critical thinking , science , technology , engineering , and math . Some of this change is hard . It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think , not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test . But it is worth it and it is working . The problem is we are still not reaching enough kids , and we are not reaching them in time . That has to change . Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child s life is high quality early education . Last year , I asked this Congress to help states make high quality pre K available to every four year old . As a parent as well as a President , I repeat that request tonight . But in the meantime , thirty states have raised pre k funding on their own . They know we cannot wait . So just as we worked with states to reform our schools , this year , we will invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children . And as Congress decides what it is going to do , I am going to pull together a coalition of elected officials , business leaders , and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high quality pre K they need . Last year , I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high speed broadband over the next four years . Tonight , I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple , Microsoft , Sprint , and Verizon , we have got a down payment to start connecting more than 15 , 000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years , without adding a dime to the deficit . We are working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real world education and hands on training that can lead directly to a job and career . We are shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information , and colleges more incentives to offer better value , so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college education . We are offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income , and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt . And I am reaching out to some of America s leading foundations and corporations ona new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential . The bottom line is , Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us . But we know our opportunity agenda will not be complete and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work , and hard work pays off for every single American . Today , women make up about half our workforce . But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns . That is wrong , and in 2014 , it is an embarrassment . A woman deserves equal pay for equal work . She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job . A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship and you know what , a father does , too . It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode . This year , let us all come together Congress , the White House , and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street to give every woman the opportunity she deserves . Because I firmly believe when women succeed , America succeeds . Now , women hold a majority of lower wage jobs but they are not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages . Americans understand that some people will earn more than others , and we do not resent those who , by virtue of their efforts , achieve incredible success . But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty . In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage , five states have passed laws to raise theirs . Many businesses have done it on their own . Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss , John Soranno . John s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis , and Nick helps make the dough . Only now he makes more of it John just gave his employees a raise , to ten bucks an hour a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale . Tonight , I ask more of America s business leaders to follow John s lead and do what you can to raise your employees wages . To every mayor , governor , and state legislator in America , I say , you do not have to wait for Congress to act Americans will support you if you take this on . And as a chief executive , I intend to lead by example . Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover . We should too . In the coming weeks , I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 . 10 an hour because if you cook our troops meals or wash their dishes , you should not have to live in poverty . Of course , to reach millions more , Congress needs to get on board . Today , the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here . Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 . 10 . This will help families . It will give businesses customers with more money to spend . It does not involve any new bureaucratic program . So join the rest of the country . Say yes . Give America a raise . There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet , and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit . Right now , it helps about half of all parents at some point . But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it does not do enough for single workers who do not have kids . So let us work together to strengthen the credit , reward work , and help more Americans get ahead . Let us do more to help Americans save for retirement . Today , most workers do not have a pension . A Social Security check often is not enough on its own . And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years , that does not help folks who do not have 401ks . That is why , tomorrow , I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings MyRIt is a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg . MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in . And if this Congress wants to help , work with me to fix an upside down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save , but does little to nothing for middle class Americans . Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job , so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can . And since the most important investment many families make is their home , send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again , and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans . One last point on financial security . For decades , few things exposed hard working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system . And in case you have not heard , we are in the process of fixing that . A pre existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley , a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona , could not get health insurance . But on January 1st , she got covered . On January 3rd , she felt a sharp pain . On January 6th , she had emergency surgery . Just one week earlier , Amanda said , that surgery would have meant bankruptcy . That is what health insurance reform is all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes , you do not have to lose everything . Already , because of the Affordable Care Act , more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents plans . More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage . And here s another number zero . Because of this law , no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma , back pain , or cancer . No woman can ever be charged more just because she is a woman . And we did all this while adding years to Medicare s finances , keeping Medicare premiums flat , and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors . Now , I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law . But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles . So again , if you have specific plans to cut costs , cover more people , and increase choice tell America what you had do differently . Let us see if the numbers add up . But let us not have another forty something votes to repeal a law that is already helping millions of Americans like Amanda . The first forty were plenty . We got it . We all owe it to the American people to say what we are for , not just what we are against . And if you want to know the real impact this law is having , just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky , who is here tonight . Kentucky s not the most liberal part of the country , but he is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth s families . They are our friends and neighbors , he said . They are people we shop and go to church with hellip farmers out on the tractors hellip grocery clerks hellip they are people who go to work every morning praying they do not get sick . No one deserves to live that way . Steve s right . That is why , tonight , I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st . Moms , get on your kids to sign up . Kids , call your mom and walk her through the application . It will give her some peace of mind plus , she will appreciate hearing from you . After all , that is the spirit that has always moved this nation forward . It is the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility , we can pursue our individual dreams , but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well . Citizenship means standing up for everyone s right to vote . Last year , part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened . But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote . Let us support these efforts . It should be the power of our vote , not the size of our bank account , that drives our democracy . Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day . I have seen the courage of parents , students , pastors , and police officers all over this country who say we are not afraid , and I intend to keep trying , with or without Congress , to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters , shopping malls , or schools like Sandy Hook . Citizenship demands a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self government an obligation to serve to our communities . And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces . Tonight , because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free , the United States is more secure . When I took office , nearly 180 , 000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , all our troops are out of Iraq . More than 60 , 000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan . With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security , our troops have moved to a support role . Together with our allies , we will complete our mission there by the end of this year , and America s longest war will finally be over . After 2014 , we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future . If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated , a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting Afghan forces , and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda . For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change , one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country . The fact is , that danger remains . While we have put al Qaeda s core leadership on a path to defeat , the threat has evolved , as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world . In Yemen , Somalia , Iraq , and Mali , we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks . In Syria , we will support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks . Here at home , we will keep strengthening our defenses , and combat new threats like cyberattacks . And as we reform our defense budget , we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform , and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions . We have to remain vigilant . But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone . As Commander in Chief , I have used force when needed to protect the American people , and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office . But I will not send our troops into harm s way unless it is truly necessary nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open ended conflicts . We must fight the battles that need to be fought , not those that terrorists prefer from us large scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism . So , even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners America must move off a permanent war footing . That is why I have imposed prudent limits on the use of drones for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence . That is why , working with this Congress , I will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence , here and abroad , that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated . And with the Afghan war ending , this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action , but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals , and setting an example for the rest of the world . You see , in a world of complex threats , our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power including strong and principled diplomacy . American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands , and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles . American diplomacy , backed by the threat of force , is why Syria s chemical weapons are being eliminated , and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship , terror and fear . As we speak , American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians , and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side . And it is American diplomacy , backed by pressure , that has halted the progress of Iran s nuclear program and rolled parts of that program back for the very first time in a decade . As we gather here tonight , Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium . It is not installing advanced centrifuges . Unprecedented inspections help the world verify , every day , that Iran is not building a bomb . And with our allies and partners , we are engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . These negotiations will be difficult . They may not succeed . We are clear eyed about Iran s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , which threaten our allies and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away . But these negotiations do not rely on trust any long term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb . If John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union , then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today . The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible . But let me be clear if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks , I will veto it . For the sake of our national security , we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed . If Iran s leaders do not seize this opportunity , then I will be the first to call for more sanctions , and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon . But if Iran s leaders do seize the chance , then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations , and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war . Finally , let us remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats , but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge greater cooperation , to expand new markets , to free people from fear and want . And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America . Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known . From Tunisia to Burma , we are supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy . In Ukraine , we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully , and have a say in their country s future . Across Africa , we are bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty . In the Americas , we are building new ties of commerce , but we are also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people . And we will continue to focus on the Asia Pacific , where we support our allies , shape a future of greater security and prosperity , and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster as we did in the Philippines , when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon , and were greeted with words like , We will never forget your kindness and God bless America We do these things because they help promote our long term security . And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being , regardless of race or religion , creed or sexual orientation . And next week , the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red , white , and blue into the Olympic Stadium and brings home the gold . My fellow Americans , no other country in the world does what we do . On every issue , the world turns to us , not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for , and the burdens we bear to advance them . No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform . As this time of war draws to a close , a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life . We will keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they have earned , and our wounded warriors receive the health care including the mental health care that they need . We will keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home . And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families . Let me tell you about one of those families I have come to know . I first met Cory Remsburg , a proud Army Ranger , at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D Day . Along with some of his fellow Rangers , he walked me through the program a strong , impressive young man , with an easy manner , sharp as a tack . We joked around , and took pictures , and I told him to stay in touch . A few months later , on his tenth deployment , Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan . His comrades found him in a canal , face down , underwater , shrapnel in his brain . For months , he lay in a coma . The next time I met him , in the hospital , he could not speak he could barely move . Over the years , he is endured dozens of surgeries and procedures , and hours of grueling rehab every day . Even now , Cory is still blind in one eye . He still struggles on his left side . But slowly , steadily , with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig , and the community around him , Cory has grown stronger . Day by day , he is learned to speak again and stand again and walk again and he is working toward the day when he can serve his country again . My recovery has not been easy , he says . Nothing in life that is worth anything is easy . Cory is here tonight . And like the Army he loves , like the America he serves , Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up , and he does not quit . My fellow Americans , men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy . Our freedom , our democracy , has never been easy . Sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged . But for more than two hundred years , we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice , and fairness , and equality under the law , so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen . The America we want for our kids a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us none of it is easy . But if we work together if we summon what is best in us , with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow I know it is within our reach . Believe it . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Last month , I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq . Together , we offered a final , proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand gave their lives . We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world . For the first time in nine years , there are no Americans fighting in Iraq . For the first time in two decades , Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country . Most of al Qaeda s top lieutenants have been defeated . The Taliban s momentum has been broken , and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home . These achievements are a testament to the courage , selflessness and teamwork of America s Armed Forces . At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down , they exceed all expectations . They are not consumed with personal ambition . They do not obsess over their differences . They focus on the mission at hand . They work together . Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example . Think about the America within our reach A country that leads the world in educating its people . An America that attracts a new generation of high tech manufacturing and high paying jobs . A future where we are in control of our own energy , and our security and prosperity are not so tied to unstable parts of the world . An economy built to last , where hard work pays off , and responsibility is rewarded . We can do this . I know we can , because we have done it before . At the end of World War Iwhen another generation of heroes returned home from combat , they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known . My grandfather , a veteran of Patton s Army , got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill . My grandmother , who worked on a bomber assembly line , was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth . The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism . They understood they were part of something larger that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share the basic American promise that if you worked hard , you could do well enough to raise a family , own a home , send your kids to college , and put a little away for retirement . The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive . No challenge is more urgent . No debate is more important . We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by , or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot , and everyone does their fair share , and everyone plays by the same set of rules . What is at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values , but American values . And we have to reclaim them . Let us remember how we got here . Long before the recession , jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores . Technology made businesses more efficient , but also made some jobs obsolete . Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before , but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing , paychecks that were not , and personal debt that kept piling up . In 2008 , the house of cards collapsed . We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who could not afford or understand them . Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people s money . Regulators had looked the other way , or did not have the authority to stop the bad behavior . It was wrong . It was irresponsible . And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work , saddled us with more debt , and left innocent , hardworking Americans holding the bag . In the six months before I took office , we lost nearly 4 million jobs . And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect . Those are the facts . But so are these In the last 22 months , businesses have created more than 3 million jobs . Last year , they created the most jobs since 2005 . American manufacturers are hiring again , creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s . Together , we have agreed to cut the deficit by more than 2 trillion . And we have put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable , so a crisis like this never happens again . The state of our Union is getting stronger . And we have come too far to turn back now . As long as I am President , I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum . But I intend to fight obstruction with action , and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place . No , we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing , bad debt , and phony financial profits . Tonight , I want to speak about how we move forward , and lay out a blueprint for an economy that is built to last an economy built on American manufacturing , American energy , skills for American workers , and a renewal of American values . Now , this blueprint begins with American manufacturing . On the day I took office , our auto industry was on the verge of collapse . Some even said we should let it die . With a million jobs at stake , I refused to let that happen . In exchange for help , we demanded responsibility . We got workers and automakers to settle their differences . We got the industry to retool and restructure . Today , General Motors is back on top as the world s number one automaker . Chrysler has grown faster in the than any major car company . Ford is investing billions in plants and factories . And together , the entire industry added nearly 160 , 000 jobs . We bet on American workers . We bet on American ingenuity . And tonight , the American auto industry is back . What is happening in Detroit can happen in other industries . It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh . We cannot bring every job back that is left our shore . But right now , it is getting more expensive to do business in places like China . Meanwhile , America is more productive . A few weeks ago , the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home . Today , for the first time in 15 years , Master Lock s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity . So we have a huge opportunity , at this moment , to bring manufacturing back . But we have to seize it . Tonight , my message to business leaders is simple Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country , and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed . We should start with our tax code . Right now , companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas . Meanwhile , companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world . It makes no sense , and everyone knows it . So let us change it . First , if you are a business that wants to outsource jobs , you should not get a tax deduction for doing it . That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home . Second , no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas . From now on , every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax . And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America . Third , if you are an American manufacturer , you should get a bigger tax cut . If you are a high tech manufacturer , we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here . And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town , you should get help financing a new plant , equipment , or training for new workers . So my message is simple . It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas , and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America . Send me these tax reforms , and I will sign them right away . We are also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world . Two years ago , I set a goal of doubling exports over five years . With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law , we are on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule . And soon , there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama , Colombia , and South Korea . Soon , there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit , and Toledo , and Chicago . I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products . And I will not stand by when our competitors do not play by the rules . We have brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration and it is made a difference . Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires . But we need to do more . It is not right when another country lets our movies , music , and software be pirated . It is not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they are heavily subsidized . Tonight , I am announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China . There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders . And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia . Our workers are the most productive on Earth , and if the playing field is level , I promise you America will always win . I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but cannot find workers with the right skills . Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job . Think about that openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work . It is inexcusable . And we know how to fix it . Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic . Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte , and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College . The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training . It paid Jackie s tuition , then hired her to help operate their plant . I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did . Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job . My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help . Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte , and Orlando , and Louisville are up and running . Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now , from data management to high tech manufacturing . And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs , so that from now on , people like Jackie have one program , one website , and one place to go for all the information and help that they need . It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work . These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today . But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow , our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier . For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year , we have convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning the first time that is happened in a generation . But challenges remain . And we know how to solve them . At a time when other countries are doubling down on education , tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers . We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over 250 , 000 . A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance . Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives . Most teachers work tirelessly , with modest pay , sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies just to make a difference . Teachers matter . So instead of bashing them , or defending the status quo , let us offer schools a deal . Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job , and reward the best ones . And in return , grant schools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion to stop teaching to the test and to replace teachers who just are not helping kids learn . That is a bargain worth making . We also know that when students do not walk away from their education , more of them walk the stage to get their diploma . When students are not allowed to drop out , they do better . So tonight , I am proposing that every state every state requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18 . When kids do graduate , the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college . At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt , this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July . Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle class families thousands of dollars , and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work study jobs in the next five years . Of course , it is not enough for us to increase student aid . We cannot just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition we will run out of money . States also need to do their part , by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets . And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down . Recently , I spoke with a group of college presidents who have done just that . Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly . Some use better technology . The point is , it is possible . So let me put colleges and universities on notice If you cannot stop tuition from going up , the funding you get from taxpayers will go down . Higher education cannot be a luxury it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford . Let us also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented , hardworking students in this country face another challenge the fact that they are not yet American citizens . Many were brought here as small children , are American through and through , yet they live every day with the threat of deportation . Others came more recently , to study business and science and engineering , but as soon as they get their degree , we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else . That does not make sense . I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration . That is why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before . That is why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office . The opponents of action are out of excuses . We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now . But if election year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan , let us at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs , start new businesses , defend this country . Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship . I will sign it right away . You see , an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country . That means women should earn equal pay for equal work . It means we should support everyone who is willing to work , and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs . After all , innovation is what America has always been about . Most new jobs are created in start ups and small businesses . So let us pass an agenda that helps them succeed . Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow . Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs . Both parties agree on these ideas . So put them in a bill , and get it on my desk this year . Innovation also demands basic research . Today , the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched . New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet . Do not gut these investments in our budget . Do not let other countries win the race for the future . Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet to new American jobs and new American industries . And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American made energy . Over the last three years , we have opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration , and tonight , I am directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources . Right now right now American oil production is the highest that it is been in eight years . That is right eight years . Not only that last year , we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years . But with only 2 percent of the world s oil reserves , oil is not enough . This country needs an all out , all of the above strategy that develops every available source of American energy . A strategy that is cleaner , cheaper , and full of new jobs . We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years . And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy . Experts believe this will support more than 600 , 000 jobs by the end of the decade . And I am requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use . Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk . The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper , proving that we do not have to choose between our environment and our economy . And by the way , it was public research dollars , over the course of 30 years , that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground . Now , what is true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy . In three years , our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world s leading manufacturer of high tech batteries . Because of federal investments , renewable energy use has nearly doubled , and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it . When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture , he said he worried that at 55 , no one would give him a second chance . But he found work at Energetx , a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan . Before the recession , the factory only made luxury yachts . Today , it is hiring workers like Bryan , who said , I am proud to be working in the industry of the future . Our experience with shale gas , our experience with natural gas , shows us that the payoffs on these public investments do not always come right away . Some technologies do not pan out some companies fail . But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy . I will not walk away from workers like Bryan . I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here . We have subsidized oil companies for a century . That is long enough . It is time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable , and double down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising . Pass clean energy tax credits . Create these jobs . We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives . The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change . But there is no reason why Congress should not at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation . So far , you have not acted . Well , tonight , I will . I am directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes . And I am proud to announce that the Department of Defense , working with us , the world s largest consumer of energy , will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year . Of course , the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy . So here s a proposal Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings . Their energy bills will be 100 billion lower over the next decade , and America will have less pollution , more manufacturing , more jobs for construction workers who need them . Send me a bill that creates these jobs . Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America s infrastructure . So much of America needs to be rebuilt . We have got crumbling roads and bridges a power grid that wastes too much energy an incomplete high speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world . During the Great Depression , America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge . After World War Iwe connected our states with a system of highways . Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody , from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today . In the next few weeks , I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects . But you need to fund these projects . Take the money we are no longer spending at war , use half of it to pay down our debt , and use the rest to do some nation building right here at home . There is never been a better time to build , especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst . Of course , construction workers were not the only ones who were hurt . So were millions of innocent Americans who have seen their home values decline . And while government cannot fix the problem on its own , responsible homeowners should not have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief . And that is why I am sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about 3 , 000 a year on their mortgage , by refinancing at historically low rates . No more red tape . No more runaround from the banks . A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it will not add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust . Let us never forget Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same . It is time to apply the same rules from top to bottom . No bailouts , no handouts , and no copouts . An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody . We have all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who could not afford them , and buyers who knew they could not afford them . That is why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior . Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices these do not destroy the free market . They make the free market work better . There is no question that some regulations are outdated , unnecessary , or too costly . In fact , I have approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his . I have ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that do not make sense . We have already announced over 500 reforms , and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion over the next five years . We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend 10 , 000 a year proving that they could contain a spill because milk was somehow classified as an oil . With a rule like that , I guess it was worth crying overspilled milk . Now , I am confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder . Absolutely . But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago . I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning , or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean . I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy , deny your coverage , or charge women differently than men . And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules . The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system s core purpose Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas , and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home , or start a business , or send their kids to college . So if you are a big bank or financial institution , you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers deposits . You are required to write out a living will that details exactly how you will pay the bills if you fail because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again . And if you are a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company , the days of signing people up for products they cannot afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices those days are over . Today , American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job To look out for them . We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large scale fraud and protect people s investments . Some financial firms violate major anti fraud laws because there is no real penalty for being a repeat offender . That is bad for consumers , and it is bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing . So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count . And tonight , I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis . This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law , speed assistance to homeowners , and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans . Now , a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy . But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future . Right now , our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile . People cannot afford losing 40 out of each paycheck this year . There are plenty of ways to get this done . So let us agree right here , right now No side issues . No drama . Pass the payroll tax cut without delay . Let us get it done . When it comes to the deficit , we have already agreed to more than 2 trillion in cuts and savings . But we need to do more , and that means making choices . Right now , we are poised to spend nearly 1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Right now , because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code , a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households . Right now , Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary . Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else like education and medical research a strong military and care for our veterans Because if we are serious about paying down our debt , we cannot do both . The American people know what the right choice is . So do As I told the Speaker this summer , I am prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid , and strengthen Social Security , so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors . But in return , we need to change our tax code so that people like me , and an awful lot of members of Congress , pay our fair share of taxes . Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule . If you make more than 1 million a year , you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes . And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires . In fact , if you are earning a million dollars a year , you should not get special tax subsidies or deductions . On the other hand , if you make under 250 , 000 a year , like 98 percent of American families , your taxes should not go up . You are the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages . You are the ones who need relief . Now , you can call this class warfare all you want . But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes Most Americans would call that common sense . We do not begrudge financial success in this country . We admire it . When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes , it is not because they envy the rich . It is because they understand that when I get a tax break I do not need and the country cannot afford , it either adds to the deficit , or somebody else has to make up the difference like a senior on a fixed income , or a student trying to get through school , or a family trying to make ends meet . That is not right . Americans know that is not right . They know that this generation s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other , and to the future of their country , and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility . That is how we will reduce our deficit . That is an America built to last . Now , I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt , energy and health care . But no matter what party they belong to , I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now Nothing will get done in Washington this year , or next year , or maybe even the year after that , because Washington is broken . Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year did not come from events beyond our control . It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not . Who benefited from that fiasco I have talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street . But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad and it seems to get worse every year . Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics . So together , let us take some steps to fix that . Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress I will sign it tomorrow . Let us limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact . Let us make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress cannot lobby Congress , and vice versa an idea that has bipartisan support , at least outside of Washington . Some of what is broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days . A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything even routine business passed through the Senate . Neither party has been blameless in these tactics . Now both parties should put an end to it . For starters , I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days . The executive branch also needs to change . Too often , it is inefficient , outdated and remote . That is why I have asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy , so that our government is leaner , quicker , and more responsive to the needs of the American people . Finally , none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town . We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas . I am a Democrat . But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves , and no more . That is why my education reform offers more competition , and more control for schools and states . That is why we are getting rid of regulations that do not work . That is why our health care law relies on a reformed private market , not a government program . On the other hand , even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads , and clean energy projects , and federal offices for the folks back home . The point is , we should all want a smarter , more effective government . And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year , we can make real progress . With or without this Congress , I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow . But I can do a whole lot more with your help . Because when we act together , there is nothing the United States of America cannot achieve . That is the lesson we have learned from our actions abroad over the last few years . Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies . From Pakistan to Yemen , the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling , knowing that they cannot escape the reach of the United States of America . From this position of strength , we have begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan . Ten thousand of our troops have come home . Twenty three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer . This transition to Afghan lead will continue , and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan , so that it is never again a source of attacks against America . As the tide of war recedes , a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa , from Tunis to Cairo from Sana a to Tripoli . A year ago , Qaddafi was one of the world s longest serving dictators a murderer with American blood on his hands . Today , he is gone . And in Syria , I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed , and that human dignity cannot be denied . How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain . But we have a huge stake in the outcome . And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate , we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well . We will stand against violence and intimidation . We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings men and women Christians , Muslims and Jews . We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets , because tyranny is no match for liberty . And we will safeguard America s own security against those who threaten our citizens , our friends , and our interests . Look at Iran . Through the power of our diplomacy , a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran s nuclear program now stands as one . The regime is more isolated than ever before its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions , and as long as they shirk their responsibilities , this pressure will not relent . Let there be no doubt America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon , and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal . But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible , and far better , and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations , it can rejoin the community of nations . The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe . Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever . Our ties to the Americas are deeper . Our ironclad commitment and I mean ironclad to Israel s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history . We have made it clear that America is a Pacific power , and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope . From the coalitions we have built to secure nuclear materials , to the missions we have led against hunger and disease from the blows we have dealt to our enemies , to the enduring power of our moral example , America is back . Anyone who tells you otherwise , anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned , does not know what they are talking about . That is not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us . That is not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin , from Cape Town to Rio , where opinions of America are higher than they have been in years . Yes , the world is changing . No , we cannot control every event . But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs and as long as I am President , I intend to keep it that way . That is why , working with our military leaders , I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world , while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget . To stay one step ahead of our adversaries , I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber threats . Above all , our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it . As they come home , we must serve them as well as they have served us . That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned which is why we have increased annual VA spending every year I have been President . And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation . With the bipartisan support of this Congress , we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets . Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of135 , 000 jobs for veterans and their families . And tonight , I am proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters , so that America is as strong as those who defend her . Which brings me back to where I began . Those of us who have been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops . When you put on that uniform , it does not matter if you are black or white Asian , Latino , Native American conservative , liberal rich , poor gay , straight . When you are marching into battle , you look out for the person next to you , or the mission fails . When you are in the thick of the fight , you rise or fall as one unit , serving one nation , leaving no one behind . One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden . On it are each of their names . Some may be Democrats . Some may be Republicans . But that does not matter . Just like it did not matter that day in the Situation Room , when I sat next to Bob Gates a man who was George Bush s defense secretary and Hillary Clinton a woman who ran against me for president . All that mattered that day was the mission . No one thought about politics . No one thought about themselves . One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he did not deserve credit for the mission . It only succeeded , he said , because every single member of that unit did their job the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control the translator who kept others from entering the compound the troops who separated the women and children from the fight the SEALs who charged up the stairs . More than that , the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other because you cannot charge up those stairs , into darkness and danger , unless you know that there is somebody behind you , watching your back . So it is with America . Each time I look at that flag , I am reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes . No one built this country on their own . This nation is great because we built it together . This nation is great because we worked as a team . This nation is great because we get each other s backs . And if we hold fast to that truth , in this moment of trial , there is no challenge too great no mission too hard . As long as we are joined in common purpose , as long as we maintain our common resolve , our journey moves forward , and our future is hopeful , and the state of our Union will always be strong . Thank you , God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you so much . Thank you . Thank you very much , everybody . Thank you . Michelle , I love you so much . A few nights ago , everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am . Malia and Sasha , we are so proud of you . And , yes , you do have to go to school in the morning . And , Joe Biden , thank you for being the very best Vice President I could have ever hoped for , and being a strong and loyal friend . Madam Chairwoman , delegates , I accept your nomination for President of the United States . Now , the first time I addressed this convention in 2004 , I was a younger man , a Senate candidate from Illinois , who spoke about hope not blind optimism , not wishful thinking , but hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward , even when the odds are great , even when the road is long . Eight years later , that hope has been tested by the cost of war , by one of the worst economic crises in history , and by political gridlock that is left us wondering whether it is still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time . I know campaigns can seem small , even silly sometimes . Trivial things become big distractions . Serious issues become sound bites . The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising . If you are sick of hearing me approve this message , believe me , so am But when all is said and done when you pick up that ballot to vote you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation . Over the next few years , big decisions will be made in Washington on jobs , the economy , taxes and deficits , energy , education , war and peace decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and on our children s lives for decades to come . And on every issue , the choice you face will not just be between two candidates or two parties . It will be a choice between two different paths for America , a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future . Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Patton s Army , the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone . They knew they were part of something larger a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression a nation where the most innovative businesses turned out the world s best products . And everyone shared in that pride and success , from the corner office to the factory floor . My grandparents were given the chance to go to college , buy their own home , and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of America s story the promise that hard work will pay off , that responsibility will be rewarded , that everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington , And I ran for President because I saw that basic bargain slipping away . I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas . And by 2008 , we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that did nothe folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition , put gas in the car or food on the table . And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession , millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs , their homes , their life savings a tragedy from which we are still fighting to recover . Now , our friends down in Tampa at the Republican Convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America . But they did not have much to say about how they had make it right . They want your vote , but they do not want you to know their plan . And that is because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions they have had for the last 30 years Have a surplus Try a tax cut . Deficit too high Try another . Feel a cold coming on Take two tax cuts , roll back some regulations and call us in the morning . Now , I have cut taxes for those who need it middle class families , small businesses . But I do not believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores or pay down our deficit . I do not believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy , or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China . After all we have been through , I do not believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small businesswoman expand or the laid off construction worker keep his home . We have been there . We have tried that and we are not going back . We are moving forward , America . Now , I will not pretend the path I am offering is quick or easy . I never have . You did not elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear . You elected me to tell you the truth . And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades . It will require common effort and shared responsibility , and the kind of bold , persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one . And , by the way , those of us who carry on his party s legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington . But know this , America our problems can be solved . Our challenges can be met . The path we offer may be harder , but it leads to a better place . And I am asking you to choose that future . I am asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country goals in manufacturing , energy , education , national security , and the deficit real , achievable plans that will lead to new jobs , more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation . That is what we can do in the next four years and that is why I am running for a second term as President of the United States . We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs . After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed , we are getting back to basics , and doing what America has always done best We are making things again . I have met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared they had never build another American car . And today , they cannot build them fast enough , because we reinvented a dying auto industry that is back on the top of the world . I have worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America not because our workers make less pay , but because we make better products . Because we work harder and smarter than anyone else . I have signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers goods that are stamped with three proud words Made in America . And after a decade of decline , this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years . And now you have a choice We can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here , in the United States of America . We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports , and if we choose this path , we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years . You can make that happen . You can choose that future . You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy . After 30 years of inaction , we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade , cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas . We have doubled our use of renewable energy , and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries . In the last year alone , we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day more than any administration in recent history . And today , the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades . So now you have a choice between a strategy that reverses this progress , or one that builds on it . We have opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years , and we will open more . But unlike my opponent , I will not let oil companies write this country s energy plan , or endanger our coastlines , or collect another 4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers . We are offering a better path . We are offering a better path , where we a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy where we develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that is right beneath our feet . If you choose this path , we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600 , 000 new jobs in natural gas alone . And , yes , my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax . More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke . They are a threat to our children s future . And in this election , you can do something about it . You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete , no matter how old they are or how much money they have . Education was the gateway to opportunity for me . It was the gateway for Michelle . It was the gateway for most of you . And now more than ever , it is the gateway to a middle class life . For the first time in a generation , nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning . Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading . Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders . And now you have a choice we can gut education , or we can decide that in the United States of America , no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school . No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they do not have the money . No company should have to look for workers overseas because they could not find any with the right skills here at home . That is not our future . That is not our future . And government has a role in this . But teachers must inspire principals must lead parents must instill a thirst for learning . And , students , you have got to do the work . And together , I promise you , we can out educate and out compete any nation on Earth . So help me . Help me recruit 100 , 000 math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early childhood education . Help give 2 million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job . Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years . We can meet that goal together . You can choose that future for America . That is our future . In a world of new threats and new challenges , you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven . Four years ago , I promised to end the war in Iraq . We did . I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 . And we have . We have blunted the Taliban s momentum in Afghanistan , and in 2014 , our longest war will be over . A new tower rises above the New York skyline al Qaeda is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead . Tonight , we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm s way . We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected . We will never forget you . And so long as I am Commander in Chief , we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known . When you take off the uniform , we will serve you as well as you have served us because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job , or a roof over their heads , or the care that they need when they come home . Around the world , we have strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons . We have reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers . From Burma to Libya to South Sudan , we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings men and women Christians and Muslims and Jews . But for all the progress that we have made , challenges remain . Terrorist plots must be disrupted . Europe s crisis must be contained . Our commitment to Israel s security must not waver , and neither must our pursuit of peace . The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions . The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists , but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today . So now we have a choice . My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy but from all that we have seen and heard , they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly . After all , you do not call Russia our number one enemy not al Qaeda Russia unless you are still stuck in a Cold War mind warp . You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you cannot visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally . My opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq . And he will not tell us how he will end the war in Afghanistan . Well , I have and I will . And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs do not even want , I will use the money we are no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways . Because after two wars that have cost us thousands of live and over a trillion dollars , it is time to do some nation building right here at home . You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class . Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by 4 trillion . And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion dollars in spending because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it is leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people . I want to reform the tax code so that it is simple , fair , and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over 250 , 000 the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was President the same rate when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs , the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot . Now , I am still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission . No party has a monopoly on wisdom . No democracy works without compromise . I want to get this done , and we can get it done . But when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy , well , what did Bill Clinton call it you do the arithmetic . You do the math . I refuse to go along with that and as long as I am President , I never will . I refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire s tax cut . I refuse to ask students to pay more for college , or kick children out of Head Start programs , or eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled all so those with the most can pay less . I am not going along with that . And I will never I will never turn Medicare into a voucher . No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies . They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned . Yes , we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul , but we will do it by reducing the cost of health care not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more . And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it , not by turning it over to Wall Street . This is the choice we now face . This is what the election comes down to . Over and over , we have been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way that since government cannot do everything , it should do almost nothing . If you cannot afford health insurance , hope that you do not get sick . If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe , well , that is the price of progress . If you cannot afford to start a business or go to college , take my opponent s advice and borrow money from your parents . You know what , that is not who we are . That is not what this country s about . As Americans , we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain , inalienable rights rights that no man or government can take away . We insist on personal responsibility and we celebrate individual initiative . We are not entitled to success we have to earn it . We honor the strivers , the dreamers , the risk takers , the entrepreneurs who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system , the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world s ever known . But we also believe in something called citizenship . Citizenship a word at the very heart of our founding a word at the very essence of our democracy the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations . We believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build , the whole company does better . We believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they cannot afford , that family is protected , but so is the value of other people s homes and so is the entire economy . We believe the little girl who is offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs or the scientist who cures cancer or the President of the United States , and it is in our power to give her that chance . We know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone . We do not want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves and we certainly do not want bailouts for banks that break the rules . We do not think that government can solve all of our problems , but we do not think that government is the source of all of our problems any more than are welfare recipients , or corporations , or unions , or immigrants , or gays , or any other group we are told to blame for our troubles . Because , America , we understand that this democracy is ours . We , the people , recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which asks only what is in it for me , a freedom without commitment to others , a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense . As citizens , we understand that America is not about what can be done for us it is about what can be done by us , together , through the hard and frustrating , but necessary work of self government . That is what we believe . So , you see , the election four years ago was not about me . It was about you . My fellow citizens , you were the change . You are the reason there is a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix who will get the surgery she needs because an insurance company cannot limit her coverage . You did that . You are the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought he had be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance . You made that possible . You are the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she is ever called home why selfless soldiers will not be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely Welcome home . Welcome home . You did that . You did that . You did that . If you turn away now if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for is not possible , well , change will not happen . If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference , then other voices will fill the void the lobbyists and special interests the people with the 10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are making it harder for you to vote Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry , or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves . Only you can make sure that does not happen . Only you have the power to move us forward . I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention . The times have changed , and so have I am no longer just a candidate . I am the President . And that means I know what it means to send young Americans into battle , for I have held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who did not return . I have shared the pain of families who have lost their homes , and the frustration of workers who have lost their jobs . If the critics are right that I have made all my decisions based on polls , then I must not be very good at reading them . And while I am very proud of what we have achieved together , I am far more mindful of my own failings , knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said , I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go . But as I stand here tonight , I have never been more hopeful about America . Not because I think I have all the answers . Not because I am na iuml ve about the magnitude of our challenges . I am hopeful because of you . The young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter she gives me hope . The autoworker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed , but kept coming to work every day , and bought flags for his whole town , and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife he gives me hope . The family business in Warroad , Minnesota , that did not lay off a single one of their 4 , 000 employees when the recession hit , even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants , even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business they give me hope . I think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed hospital , still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee . Six months ago , we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iraq , tall and 20 pounds heavier , dashing in his uniform , with a big grin on his face , sturdy on his new leg . And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle , racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day , inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled he gives me hope . He gives me hope . I do not know what party these men and women belong to . I do not know if they will vote for me . But I know that their spirit defines us . They remind me , in the words of Scripture , that ours is a future filled with hope . And if you share that faith with me if you share that hope with me I ask you tonight for your vote . If you reject the notion that this nation s promise is reserved for the few , your voice must be heard in this election . If you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder , you need to stand up in this election . If you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape , that new energy can power our future , that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot , and everyone does their fair share , and everyone plays by the same rules then I need you to vote this November . America , I never said this journey would be easy , and I will not promise that now . Yes , our path is harder , but it leads to a better place . Yes , our road is longer , but we travel it together . We do not turn back . We leave no one behind . We pull each other up . We draw strength from our victories , and we learn from our mistakes , but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon , knowing that Providence is with us , and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless these United States .<speech_sep>I wanted to come out here , first of all , to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session . The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks , there is going to obviously be a whole range of issues immigration , economics , et cetera we will try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions . The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions , but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling . I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday . But watching the debate over the course of the last week , I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit . First of all , I want to make sure that , once again , I send my thoughts and prayers , as well as Michelle s , to the family of Trayvon Martin , and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they have dealt with the entire situation . I can only imagine what they are going through , and it is remarkable how they have handled it . The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday , which is there is going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case I will let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues . The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner . The prosecution and the defense made their arguments . The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant , and they rendered a verdict . And once the jury has spoken , that is how our system works . But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling . You know , when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son . Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago . And when you think about why , in the African American community at least , there is a lot of pain around what happened here , I think it is important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does not go away . There are very few African American men in this country who have not had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store . That includes me . There are very few African American men who have not had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars . That happens to me at least before I was a senator . There are very few African Americans who have not had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off . That happens often . And I do not want to exaggerate this , but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida . And it is inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear . The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws . And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case . Now , this is not to say that the African American community is na iuml ve about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence . It is not to make excuses for that fact although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context . They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country , and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history . And so the fact that sometimes that is unacknowledged adds to the frustration . And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given , well , there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain . I think the African American community is also not na iuml ve in understanding that , statistically , somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else . So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys . But they get frustrated , I think , if they feel that there is no context for it and that context is being denied . And that all contributes I think to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario , that , from top to bottom , both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different . Now , the question for me at least , and I think for a lot of folks , is where do we take this How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction I think it is understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests , and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through , as long as it remains nonviolent . If I see any violence , then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family . But beyond protests or vigils , the question is , are there some concrete things that we might be able to do . I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there , but I think it is important for people to have some clear expectations here . Traditionally , these are issues of state and local government , the criminal code . And law enforcement is traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal levels . That does not mean , though , that as a nation we cannot do some things that I think would be productive . So let me just give a couple of specifics that I am still bouncing around with my staff , so we are not rolling out some five point plan , but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus . Number one , precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level , I think it would be productive for the Justice Department , governors , mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists . When I was in Illinois , I passed racial profiling legislation , and it actually did just two simple things . One , it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped . But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing . And initially , the police departments across the state were resistant , but actually they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair , straightforward way that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and , in turn , be more helpful in applying the law . And obviously , law enforcement has got a very tough job . So that is one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if state and local governments are receptive . And I think a lot of them would be . And let us figure out are there ways for us to push out that kind of training . Along the same lines , I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case , rather than diffuse potential altercations . I know that there is been commentary about the fact that the stand your ground laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case . On the other hand , if we are sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there is a way for them to exit from a situation , is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we had like to see And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these stand your ground laws , I had just ask people to consider , if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed , could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous , then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws . Number three and this is a long term project we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys . And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about . There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement . And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them I am not na iuml ve about the prospects of some grand , new federal program . I am not sure that that is what we are talking about here . But I do recognize that as President , I have got some convening power , and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front . And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes , and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they are a full part of this society and that they have got pathways and avenues to succeed I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation . And we are going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that . And then , finally , I think it is going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching . There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race . I have not seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations . They end up being stilted and politicized , and folks are locked into the positions they already have . On the other hand , in families and churches and workplaces , there is the possibility that people are a little bit more honest , and at least you ask yourself your own questions about , am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can Am I judging people as much as I can , based on not the color of their skin , but the content of their character That would , I think , be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy . And let me just leave you with a final thought that , as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people , I do not want us to lose sight that things are getting better . Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race . It does not mean we are in a post racial society . It does not mean that racism is eliminated . But when I talk to Malia and Sasha , and I listen to their friends and I seem them interact , they are better than we are they are better than we were on these issues . And that is true in every community that I have visited all across the country . And so we have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues . And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature , as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions . But we should also have confidence that kids these days , I think , have more sense than we did back then , and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long , difficult journey , we are becoming a more perfect union not a perfect union , but a more perfect union . Thank you , guys .<speech_sep>Good morning , everybody . As you know , I just met with leaders of both parties to discuss a way forward in light of the severe budget cuts that start to take effect today . I told them these cuts will hurt our economy . They will cost us jobs . And to set it right , both sides need to be willing to compromise . The good news is the American people are strong and they are resilient . They fought hard to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , and we will get through this as well . Even with these cuts in place , folks all across this country will work hard to make sure that we keep the recovery going . But Washington sure is not making it easy . At a time when our businesses have finally begun to get some traction hiring new workers , bringing jobs back to America we should not be making a series of dumb , arbitrary cuts to things that businesses depend on and workers depend on , like education , and research , and infrastructure and defense . It is unnecessary . And at a time when too many Americans are still looking for work , it is inexcusable . Now , what is important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away . The pain , though , will be real . Beginning this week , many middle class families will have their lives disrupted in significant ways . Businesses that work with the military , like the Virginia shipbuilder that I visited on Tuesday , may have to lay folks off . Communities near military bases will take a serious blow . Hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country Border Patrol agents , FBI agents , civilians who work at the Pentagon all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs . All of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy . Layoffs and pay cuts means that people have less money in their pockets , and that means that they have less money to spend at local businesses . That means lower profits . That means fewer hires . The longer these cuts remain in place , the greater the damage to our economy a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day . So economists are estimating that as a consequence of this sequester , that we could see growth cut by over one half of 1 percent . It will cost about 750 , 000 jobs at a time when we should be growing jobs more quickly . So every time that we get a piece of economic news , over the next month , next two months , next six months , as long as the sequester is in place , we will know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act . And let us be clear . None of this is necessary . It is happening because of a choice that Republicans in Congress have made . They have allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit . As recently as yesterday , they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well off and well connected , and they think that that is apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts . I do believe that we can and must replace these cuts with a more balanced approach that asks something from everybody Smart spending cuts entitlement reform tax reform that makes the tax code more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates all so that we can responsibly lower the deficit without laying off workers , or forcing parents to scramble for childcare , or slashing financial aid for college students . I do not think that is too much to ask . I do not think that is partisan . It is the kind of approach that I have proposed for two years . It is what I ran on last year . And the majority of the American people agree with me in this approach , including , by the way , a majority of Republicans . We just need Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own party and their country on this . And if they did so , we could make a lot of progress . I do know that there are Republicans in Congress who privately , at least , say that they would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through . I know that there are Democrats who d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts go through . So there is a caucus of common sense up on Capitol Hill . It is just it is a silent group right now , and we want to make sure that their voices start getting heard . In the coming days and in the coming weeks I am going to keep on reaching out to them , both individually and as groups of senators or members of the House , and say to them , let us fix this not just for a month or two , but for years to come . Because the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in month to month increments , or by careening from crisis to crisis . And America has got a lot more work to do . In the meantime , we cannot let political gridlock around the budget stand in the way of other areas where we can make progress . I was pleased to see that the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday . That is a big win for not just women but for families and for the American people . It is a law that is going to save lives and help more Americans live free from fear . It is something that we have been pushing on for a long time . I was glad to see that done . And it is an example of how we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress even though there is still these fiscal arguments taking place . And I think there are other areas where we can make progress even with the sequester unresolved . I will continue to push for those initiatives . I am going to keep pushing for high quality preschool for every family that wants it . I am going to keep pushing to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that it is one that families can live on . I am going to keep on pushing for immigration reform , and reform our voting system , and improvements on our transportation sector . And I am going to keep pushing for sensible gun reforms because I still think they deserve a vote . This is the agenda that the American people voted for . These are America s priorities . They are too important to go unaddressed . And I am going to keep pushing to make sure that we see them through . So with that , I am going to take some questions . I am going to start with Julie . Look , we have already cut 2 . 5 trillion in our deficit . Everybody says we need to cut 4 trillion , which means we have to come up with another trillion and a half . The vast majority of economists agree that the problem when it comes to deficits is not discretionary spending . It is not that we are spending too much money on education . It is not that we are spending too much money on job training , or that we are spending too much money rebuilding our roads and our bridges . We are not . The problem that we have is a long term problem in terms of our health care costs and programs like Medicare . And what I have said very specifically , very detailed is that I am prepared to take on the problem where it exists on entitlements and do some things that my own party really does not like if it is part of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction . So the deal that I have put forward over the last two years , the deal that I put forward as recently as December is still on the table . I am prepared to do hard things and to push my Democratic friends to do hard things . But what I cannot do is ask middle class families , ask seniors , ask students to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when we know we have got a bunch of tax loopholes that are benefiting the well off and the well connected , are not contributing to growth , are not contributing to our economy . It is not fair . It is not right . The American people do not think it is fair and do not think it is right . So I recognize that Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his caucus . I recognize that it is very hard for Republican leaders to be perceived as making concessions to me . Sometimes , I reflect is there something else I could do to make these guys I am not talking about the leaders now , but maybe some of the House Republican caucus members not paint horns on my head . And I genuinely believe that there is an opportunity for us to cooperate . But what does not make sense and the only thing that we have seen from Republicans so far in terms of proposals is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts . That is not going to help the economy . That is not going to help growth . That is not going to create jobs . And as a number of economists have noted , ironically , it does not even reduce our deficit in the smartest way possible or the fastest way possible . So in terms of going forward , my hope is that after some reflection as members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted , as we start seeing the impact that the sequester is having that they step back and say , all right , is there a way for us to move forward on a package of entitlement reforms , tax reform , not raising tax rates , identifying programs that do not work , coming up with a plan that is comprehensive and that makes sense . And it may take a couple of weeks . It may take a couple of months , but I am just going to keep on pushing on it . And my view is that , ultimately , common sense prevails . But what is true right now is that the Republicans have made a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we will not accept an extra dime s worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to get any larger comprehensive deal . And that is a choice they are making . They are saying that it is more important to preserve these tax loopholes than it is to prevent these arbitrary cuts . And what is interesting is Speaker Boehner , just a couple months ago , identified these tax loopholes and tax breaks and said we should close them and raise revenue . So it is not as if it is not possible to do . They themselves have suggested that it is possible to do . And if they believe that in fact these tax loopholes and these tax breaks for the well off and the well connected are not contributing to growth , are not good for our economy , are not particularly fair and can raise revenue , well , why do not we get started Why do not we do that It may be that because of the politics within the Republican Party , they cannot do it right now . I understand that . My hope is , is that they can do it later . And I just want to repeat , Julie , because I think it is very important to understand , it is not as if Democrats are not being asked to do anything , either , to compromise . There are members of my party who violently disagree with the notion that we should do anything on Medicare . And I am willing to say to them , I disagree with you , because I want to preserve Medicare for the long haul . And we are going to have some tough politics within my party to get this done . This is not a situation where I am only asking for concessions from Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats . I am saying that everybody is going to have to do something . And the one key to this whole thing is trying to make sure we keep in mind who we are here for . We are not here for ourselves , we are not here for our parties , we are not here to advance our electoral prospects . We are here for American families who have been getting battered pretty good over the last four years , are just starting to see the economy improve businesses are just starting to see some confidence coming back . And this is not a win for anybody , this is a loss for the American people . And , again , if we step back and just remind ourselves what it is we are supposed to be doing here , then hopefully common sense will out in the end . Well , Julie , give me an example of what I might do . Well , no , but I am trying to clarify the question . What I am suggesting is , I have put forward a plan that calls for serious spending cuts , serious entitlement reforms , goes right at the problem that is at the heart of our long term deficit problem . I have offered negotiations around that kind of balanced approach . And so far , we have gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have said is , we cannot do any revenue , we cannot do a dime s worth of revenue . So what more do you think I should do Okay , I just wanted to clarify . Because if people have a suggestion , I am happy to this is a room full of smart folks . All right Zach Goldfarb . Well , I had like to think I have still got some persuasive power left . Let me check . Look , the issue is not my persuasive power . The American people agree with my approach . They agree that we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction . The question is can the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do the right thing , and I have a lot of confidence that over time , if the American people express their displeasure about how something is working , that eventually Congress responds . Sometimes there is a little gap between what the American people think and what Congress thinks . But eventually Congress catches up . With respect to the budget and keeping the government open I will try for our viewing audience to make sure that we are not talking in Washington gobbledygook . What is called the continuing resolution , which is essentially just an extension of last year s budget into this year s budget to make sure that basic government functions continue , I think it is the right thing to do to make sure that we do not have a government shutdown . And that is preventable . We have a Budget Control Act , right We agreed to a certain amount of money that was going to be spent each year , and certain funding levels for our military , our education system , and so forth . If we stick to that deal , then I will be supportive of us sticking to that deal . It is a deal that I made . The sequester are additional cuts on top of that . And by law , until Congress takes the sequester away , we had have to abide by those additional cuts . But there is no reason why we should have another crisis by shutting the government down in addition to these arbitrary spending cuts . Zach , I am not going to I never want to make myself 100 percent clear with you guys . But I think it is fair to say that I made a deal for a certain budget , certain numbers . There is no reason why that deal needs to be reopened . It was a deal that Speaker Boehner made as well , and all the leadership made . And if the bill that arrives on my desk is reflective of the commitments that we have previously made , then obviously I would sign it because I want to make sure that we keep on doing what we need to do for the American people . Jessica . I mean , Jessica , I am not a dictator . I am the President . So , ultimately , if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say , we need to go to catch a plane , I cannot have Secret Service block the doorway , right So I understand . And I know that this has been some of the conventional wisdom that is been floating around Washington that somehow , even though most people agree that I am being reasonable , that most people agree I am presenting a fair deal , the fact that they do not take it means that I should somehow do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what is right . Well , they are elected . We have a constitutional system of government . The Speaker of the House and the leader of the Senate and all those folks have responsibilities . What I can do is I can make the best possible case for why we need to do the right thing . I can speak to the American people about the consequences of the decisions that Congress is making or the lack of decision making by Congress . But , ultimately , it is a choice they make . And this idea that somehow there is a secret formula or secret sauce to get Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say , you know what , President , you are right , we should close some tax loopholes for the well off and well connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we do not need . I think if there was a secret way to do that , I would have tried it . I would have done it . What I can do is I can make the best possible argument . And I can offer concessions , and I can offer compromise . I can negotiate . I can make sure that my party is willing to compromise and is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of political terms . And I think I have done that and I will continue to do that . But what I cannot do is force Congress to do the right thing . The American people may have the capacity to do that . And in the absence of a decision on the part of the Speaker of the House and others to put middle class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now , we are going to have these cuts in place . But , again , I am hopeful about human nature . I think that over time people do the right thing . And I will keep on reaching out and seeing if there are other formulas or other ways to jigger this thing into place so that we get a better result . Well Jessica , look , I will just give you an example . The Department of Defense right now has to figure out how the children of military families are going to continue with their schooling over the next several months , because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians . They are therefore subject to furlough , which means that they may not be able to teach one day a week . Now , I expect that we will be able to manage around it . But if I am a man or woman in uniform in Afghanistan right now , the notion that my spouse back home is having to worry about whether or not our kids are getting the best education possible , the notion that my school for my children on an Army base might be disrupted because Congress did not act , that is an impact . Now , Mayor Bloomberg and others may not feel that impact . I suspect they will not . But that family will . The Border Patrol agents who are out there in the hot sun , doing what Congress said they are supposed to be doing , finding out suddenly that they are getting a 10 percent pay cut and having to go home and explain that to their families , I do not think they feel like this is an exaggerated impact . So I guess it depends on where you sit . Now , what is absolutely true is that not everybody is going to feel it . Not everybody is going to feel it all at once . What is true is that the accumulation of those stories all across this country , folks who suddenly might have been working all their lives to get an education , just so that they can get that job and get out of welfare and they have got their kid in Head Start , and now , suddenly , that Head Start slot is gone and they are trying to figure out how am I going to keep my job , because I cannot afford child care for my kid some of the suppliers for those shipbuilders down in Virginia , where you have got some suppliers who are small businesses , this is all they do , and they may shut down those companies , and their employees are going to be laid off the accumulation of all of those stories of impact is going to make our economy weaker . It is going to mean less growth . It is going to mean hundreds of thousands of jobs lost . That is real . That is not we are not making that up . That is not a scare tactic , that is a fact . Starting tomorrow , everybody here , all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol now that Congress has left , somebody is going to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the garbage they are going to have less pay . The janitors , the security guards , they just got a pay cut , and they have got to figure out how to manage that . That is real . So I want to be very clear here . It is absolutely true that this is not going to precipitate the kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the problems around the debt ceiling . I do not anticipate a huge financial crisis , but people are going to be hurt . The economy will not grow as quickly as it would have . Unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have and there are lives behind that . And that is real . And it is not necessary that is the problem . Christi Parsons . Hey , Christi . As everybody here knows , last year , upon a long period of reflection , I concluded that we cannot discriminate against same sex couples when it comes to marriage that the basic principle that America is founded on the idea that we are all created equal applies to everybody , regardless of sexual orientation , as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity . And I think that the same evolution that I have gone through is an evolution that the country as a whole has gone through . And I think it is a profoundly positive thing . So that when the Supreme Court essentially called the question by taking this case about California s law , I did not feel like that was something that this administration could avoid . I felt it was important for us to articulate what I believe and what this administration stands for . And although I do think that we are seeing , on a state by state basis , progress being made more and more states recognizing same sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do when the Supreme Court asks , do you think that the California law , which does not provide any rationale for discriminating against same sex couples other than just the notion that , well , they are same sex couples , if the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General , do we think that meets constitutional muster , I felt it was important for us to answer that question honestly and the answer is no . Well , that is an argument that I have made personally . The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court is obliged to answer the specific question before them . And the specific question presented before the Court right now is whether Prop 8 and the California law is unconstitutional . And what we have done is we have put forward a basic principle , which is which applies to all equal protection cases . Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against , the Court asks the question , what is the rationale for this and it better be a good reason . And if you do not have a good reason , we are going to strike it down . And what we have said is , is that same sex couples are a group , a class that deserves heightened scrutiny , that the Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it is doing it . And if the state does not have a good reason , it should be struck down . That is the core principle as applied to this case . Now , the Court may decide that if it does not apply in this case , it probably cannot apply in any case . There is no good reason for it . If I were on the Court , that would probably be the view that I had put forward . But I am not a judge , I am the President . So the basic principle , though , is let us treat everybody fairly and let us treat everybody equally . And I think that the brief that is been presented accurately reflects our views . Ari Shapiro . Right . Well , a couple of things . Number one is to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that are important to middle class Americans and those who are fighting to get into the middle class . So if you set aside budget fights for a second , we have been able to get now the Violence Against Women Act done . The conversations that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward . We have seen great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system , including around early childhood education . There have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence . And what I am going to keep on trying to do is to make sure that we push on those things that are important to families . And we will not get everything done all at once , but we can get a lot done . So that is point number one . With respect to the budget , what I have done is to make a case to the American people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction , but that deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy . And part of the challenge that we have had here is that not only Congress , but I think Washington generally spends all its time together about deficits and does not spend a lot of time talking about how do we create jobs . So I want to make sure that we are talking about both . I think that , for example , we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuilding our roads and bridges . And this is deferred maintenance . We know we are going to have to do it . And I went to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell s state to John Boehner s state , and it was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it . And I will bet they really want to see that improved . Well , how do we do it Let us have a conversation about it . That will create jobs . It will be good for businesses , reduce commuter times , improve commuter safety . That has to be part of this conversation , not just this constant argument about cutting and spending . So I guess my point is , Ari , that what I want to try to do is to make sure that we are constantly focused , that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed . Deficit reduction is part of that agenda and an important part . But it is not the only part . And I do not want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this one thing . And as I already said to Jessica , what I am also hoping is , is that , over time perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say , you know what , we stuck tough on the sequester , and this makes us feel good , and the Republican caucus is in a better mood when they come back maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are . And the good thing about America is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we get stuck , and you have these sharp , partisan fights , but the American people pretty steadily are common sense and practical , and eventually , that common sense , practical approach wins out . And I think that is what will happen here as well . And , in the meantime , just to make the final point about the sequester , we will get through this . This is not going to be a apocalypse , I think as some people have said . It is just dumb . And it is going to hurt . It is going to hurt individual people and it is going to hurt the economy overall . But if Congress comes to its senses a week from now , a month from now , three months from now , then there is a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the American people dramatically . So this is a temporary stop on what I believe is the long term , outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans , tonight I want to talk to you about Syria why it matters , and where we go from here . Over the past two years , what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al Assad has turned into a brutal civil war . Over 100 , 000 people have been killed . Millions have fled the country . In that time , America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support , to help the moderate opposition , and to shape a political settlement . But I have resisted calls for military action , because we cannot resolve someone else s civil war through force , particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan . The situation profoundly changed , though , on August 21st , when Assad s government gassed to death over a thousand people , including hundreds of children . The images from this massacre are sickening Men , women , children lying in rows , killed by poison gas . Others foaming at the mouth , gasping for breath . A father clutching his dead children , imploring them to get up and walk . On that terrible night , the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons , and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off limits a crime against humanity , and a violation of the laws of war . This was not always the case . In World War American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe . In World War Ithe Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust . Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale , with no distinction between soldier and infant , the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them . And in 1997 , the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons , now joined by 189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity . On August 21st , these basic rules were violated , along with our sense of common humanity . No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria . The world saw thousands of videos , cell phone pictures , and social media accounts from the attack , and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas . Moreover , we know the Assad regime was responsible . In the days leading up to August 21st , we know that Assad s chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas . They distributed gasmasks to their troops . Then they fired rockets from a regime controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces . Shortly after those rockets landed , the gas spread , and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded . We know senior figures in Assad s military machine reviewed the results of the attack , and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed . We have also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin . When dictators commit atrocities , they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory . But these things happened . The facts cannot be denied . The question now is what the United States of America , and the international community , is prepared to do about it . Because what happened to those people to those children is not only a violation of international law , it is also a danger to our security . Let me explain why . If we fail to act , the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons . As the ban against these weapons erodes , other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas , and using them . Over time , our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield . And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons , and to use them to attack civilians . If fighting spills beyond Syria s borders , these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey , Jordan , and Israel . And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction , and embolden Assad s ally , Iran which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon , or to take a more peaceful path . This is not a world we should accept . This is what is at stake . And that is why , after careful deliberation , I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime s use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike . The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons , to degrade his regime s ability to use them , and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use . That is my judgment as Commander in Chief . But I am also the President of the world s oldest constitutional democracy . So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes , I believed it was right , in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security , to take this debate to Congress . I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress . And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together . This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war making power in the hands of the President , and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops , while sidelining the people s representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force . Now , I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan , the idea of any military action , no matter how limited , is not going to be popular . After all , I have spent four and a half years working to end wars , not to start them . Our troops are out of Iraq . Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan . And I know Americans want all of us in Washington especially me to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home putting people back to work , educating our kids , growing our middle class . It is no wonder , then , that you are asking hard questions . So let me answer some of the most important questions that I have heard from members of Congress , and that I have read in letters that you have sent to me . First , many of you have asked , will not this put us on a slippery slope to another war One man wrote to me that we are still recovering from our involvement in Iraq . A veteran put it more bluntly This nation is sick and tired of war . My answer is simple I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria . I will not pursue an open ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan . I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo . This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective deterring the use of chemical weapons , and degrading Assad s capabilities . Others have asked whether it is worth acting if we do not take out Assad . As some members of Congress have said , there is no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria . Let me make something clear The United States military does not do pinpricks . Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver . I do not think we should remove another dictator with force we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next . But a targeted strike can make Assad , or any other dictator , think twice before using chemical weapons . Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation . We do not dismiss any threats , but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military . Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day . Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise . And our ally , Israel , can defend itself with overwhelming force , as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America . Many of you have asked a broader question Why should we get involved at all in a place that is so complicated , and where as one person wrote to me those who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights It is true that some of Assad s opponents are extremists . But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death . The majority of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition we work with just want to live in peace , with dignity and freedom . And the day after any military action , we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism . Finally , many of you have asked Why not leave this to other countries , or seek solutions short of force As several people wrote to me , We should not be the world s policeman . I agree , and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions . Over the last two years , my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions , warning and negotiations but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime . However , over the last few days , we have seen some encouraging signs . In part because of the credible threat of military action , as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin , the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons . The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons , and even said they had join the Chemical Weapons Convention , which prohibits their use . It is too early to tell whether this offer will succeed , and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments . But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force , particularly because Russia is one of Assad s strongest allies . I have , therefore , asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path . I am sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday , and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin . I have spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies , France and the United Kingdom , and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons , and to ultimately destroy them under international control . We will also give inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st . And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas from Asia to the Middle East who agree on the need for action . Meanwhile , I have ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad , and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails . And tonight , I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices . My fellow Americans , for nearly seven decades , the United States has been the anchor of global security . This has meant doing more than forging international agreements it has meant enforcing them . The burdens of leadership are often heavy , but the world is a better place because we have borne them . And so , to my friends on the right , I ask you to reconcile your commitment to America s military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just . To my friends on the left , I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain , and going still on a cold hospital floor . For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough . Indeed , I had ask every member of Congress , and those of you watching at home tonight , to view those videos of the attack , and then ask What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas , and we choose to look the other way Franklin Roosevelt once said , Our national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged . Our ideals and principles , as well as our national security , are at stake in Syria , along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used . America is not the world s policeman . Terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong . But when , with modest effort and risk , we can stop children from being gassed to death , and thereby make our own children safer over the long run , I believe we should act . That is what makes America different . That is what makes us exceptional . With humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Madam Speaker , Vice President Biden , Members of Congress , and the American people When I spoke here last winter , this Nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . We were losing an average of 700 , 000 jobs per month , credit was frozen , and our financial system was on the verge of collapse . Now , as any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you , we are by no means out of the woods . A full and vibrant recovery is still many months away . And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them , until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive , until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes . That is our ultimate goal . But thanks to the bold and decisive action we have taken since January , I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink . I want to thank the Members of this body for your efforts and your support in these last several months , and especially those who have taken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery . I also want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve during this trying time for our Nation . But we did not come here just to clean up crises . We came here to build a future . So tonight , I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future , and that is the issue of health care . I am not the first President to take up this cause , but I am determined to be the last . It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform , and ever since , nearly every President and Congress , whether Democrat or Republican , has attempted to meet this challenge in some way . A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell , , in 1943 . Sixty five years later , his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session . Our collective failure to meet this challenge , year after year , decade after decade , has led us to the breaking point . Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy . These are not primarily people on welfare these are middle class Americans . Some cannot get insurance on the job . Others are self employed and cannot afford it since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer . Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or too expensive to cover . We are the only democracy the only advanced democracy on Earth the only wealthy nation that allows such hardship for millions of its people . There are now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage . In just a 2 year period , one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point . And every day , 14 , 000 Americans lose their coverage . In other words , it can happen to anyone . But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem for the uninsured . Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today . More and more Americans worry that if you move , lose your job , or change your job , you will lose your health insurance too . More and more Americans pay their premiums only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick or will not pay the full cost of care . It happens every day . One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he had not reported gallstones that he did not even know about . They delayed his treatment , and he died because of it . Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne . By the time she had her insurance reinstated , her breast cancer had more than doubled in size . That is heart breaking , it is wrong , and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America . Then there is the problem of rising cost . We spend one and a half times more per person on health care than any other country , but we are not any healthier for it . This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages . It is why so many employers , especially small businesses , are forcing their employers employees to pay more for insurance or are dropping their coverage entirely . It is why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place and why American businesses that compete internationally , like our automakers , are at a huge disadvantage . And it is why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it , about 1 , 000 per year that pays for somebody else s emergency room and charitable care . Finally , our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers . When health care costs grow at the rate they have , it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid . If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs , we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other Government program combined . Put simply , our health care problem is our deficit problem . Nothing else even comes close . Nothing else . Now , these are the facts . Nobody disputes them . We know we must reform this system . The question is how . Now , there are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single payer system like Canada s , where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the Government provide coverage for everybody . On the right , there are those who argue that we should end employer based systems and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own . I have said I have to say that there are arguments to be made for both these approaches . But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have . Since health care represents one sixth of our economy , I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what does not , rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch . And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the several past several months . During that time , we have seen Washington at its best and at its worst . We have seen many in this Chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform . Of the five committees asked to develop bills , four have completed their work , and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week . That has never happened before . Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses , hospitals , seniors groups , and even drug companies , many of whom opposed reform in the past . And there is agreement in this Chamber on about 80 percent of what needs to be done , putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been . But what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have towards their own government . Instead of honest debate , we have seen scare tactics . Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise . Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short term political points , even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long term challenge . And out of this blizzard of charges and countercharges , confusion has reigned . Well , the time for bickering is over . The time for games has passed . Now is the season for action . Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do . Now is the time to deliver on health care . Now is the time to deliver on health care . The plan I am announcing tonight would meet three basic goals It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance it will provide insurance for those who do not and it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families , our businesses , and our Government . It is a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge , not just government , not just insurance companies , but everybody , including employers and individuals . And it is a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen , from Democrats and Republicans , and yes , from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election . Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan . First , if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job or Medicare or Medicaid or the Vnothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have . Let me repeat this Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have . What this plan will do is make the insurance you have work better for you . Under this plan , it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition . As soon as I sign this bill , it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it the most . They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or in a lifetime . We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out of pocket expenses , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they get sick . And insurance companies will be required to cover , with no extra charge , routine checkups and preventive care , like mammograms and colonoscopies , because there is no reason we should not be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse . That makes sense , it saves money , and it saves lives . Now , that is what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan , more security and more stability . Now , if you are one of the tens of millions of Americans who do not currently have health insurance , the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality , affordable choices . If you lose your job or you change your job , you will be able to get coverage . If you strike out on your own and start a small business , you will be able to get coverage . We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange , a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices . Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers . As one big group , these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage . This is how large companies and Government employees get affordable insurance , it is how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance , and it is time to give every American the same opportunity that we give ourselves . Now , for those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower priced insurance available in the exchange , we will provide tax credits , the size of which will be based on your need . And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned . This exchange will take effect in 4 years , which will give us time to do it right . In the meantime , for those Americans who cannot get insurance today because they have preexisting medical conditions , we will immediately offer low cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill . This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign , it is a good idea now , and we should all embrace it . Now , even if we provide these affordable options , there may be those , especially the young and the healthy , who still want to take the risk and go without coverage . There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers by giving them coverage . The problem is , such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money . If there are affordable options and people still do not sign up for health insurance , it means we pay for these people s expensive emergency room visits . If some businesses do not provide workers health care , it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors . And unless everybody does their part , many of the insurance reforms we seek , especially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions , just cannot be achieved . And that is why under my plan , individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance , just as most States require you to carry auto insurance . Likewise , businesses will be required to either offer their workers health care or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers . There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still cannot afford coverage , and 95 percent of all small businesses , because of their size and narrow profit margin , would be exempt from these requirements . But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees . Improving our health care system only works if everybody does their part . And while there remain some significant details to be ironed out , I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined consumer protections for those with insurance , an exchange that allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable coverage , and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance . And I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life as well as the economy as a whole . Still , given all the misinformation that is been spread over the past few months , I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform . So tonight I want to address some of the key controversies that are still out there . Some of people s concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost . The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts , but by prominent politicians , that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens . Now , such a charge would be laughable if it were not so cynical and irresponsible . It is a lie , plain and simple . Now , there are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants . This too is false . The reforms I am proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally . Representative Joe Wilson . You lie The President . It is not true . And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up , under our plan , no Federal dollars will be used to fund abortions , and Federal conscience laws will remain in place . Now , my health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a Government takeover of the entire health care system . As proof , critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly sponsored insurance option , administered by the Government just like Medicaid or Medicare . So let me set the record straight here . My guiding principle is , and always has been , that consumers do better when there is choice and competition . That is how the market works . Unfortunately , in 34 States , 75 percent of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies . In Alabama , almost 90 percent is controlled by just one company . And without competition , the price of insurance goes up and quality goes down . And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly by cherry picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest , by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage , and by jacking up rates . Insurance executives do not do this because they are bad people they do it because it is profitable . As one former insurance executive testified before Congress , insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill , they are rewarded for it . All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called Wall Street s relentless profit expectations . Now , I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of business . They provide a legitimate service and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors . I just want to hold them accountable . And the insurance reforms that I have already mentioned would do just that . But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not for profit public option available in the insurance exchange . Now , let me be clear . Let me be clear . It would only be an option for those who do not have insurance . No one would be forced to choose it , and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance . In fact , based on Congressional Budget Office estimates , we believe that less than 5 percent of Americans would sign up . Despite all this , the insurance companies and their allies do not like this idea . They argue that these private companies cannot fairly compete with the Government . And they had be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option . But they will not be . I have insisted that like any private insurance company , the public insurance option would have to be self sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects . But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits and excessive administrative costs and executive salaries , it could provide a good deal for consumers and would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better , the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities . Now , it is worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I have proposed tonight . But its impact should not be exaggerated by the left or the right or the media . It is only one part of my plan and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles . To my progressive friends , I would remind you that for decades , the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage available for those without it . The public option is only a means to that end , and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal . And to my Republican friends , I say that rather than making wild claims about a Government takeover of health care , we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have . Now , for example , some have suggested that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies . Others have proposed a co op or another nonprofit entity to administer the plan . These are all constructive ideas worth exploring . But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans cannot find affordable coverage , we will provide you with a choice . And I will make sure that no Government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need . Finally , let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me , to Members of this Chamber , and to the public , and that is how we pay for this plan . And here s what you need to know . First , I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits , either now or in the future . I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit , now or in the future , period . And to prove that I am serious , there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we have promised do not materialize . Now , part of the reason I faced a trillion dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for , from the Iraq war to tax breaks for the wealthy . I will not make that same mistake with health care . Second , we have estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system , a system that is currently full of waste and abuse . Right now , too much of the hard earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care do not make us any healthier . That is not my judgment it is the judgment of medical professionals across this country . And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid . In fact , I want to speak directly to seniors for a moment , because Medicare is another issue that is been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate . More than four decades ago , this Nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work , our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years . That is how Medicare was born , and it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next . And that is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan . The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies , subsidies that do everything to pad their profits but do not improve the care of seniors . And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead . Now , these steps will ensure that you , America s seniors , get the benefits you have been promised . They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations . And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pockets for prescription drugs . That is what this plan will do for you . So do not pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut , especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past and just this year supported a budget that would essentially have turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program . That will not happen on my watch . I will protect Medicare . Now , because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system , making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody . We have long known that some places , like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania , offer high quality care at costs below average . So the commission can help encourage the adoption of these commonsense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system , everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors . Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan . Now , much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers . And this reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies , which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money , an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts . And according to these same experts , this modest change could help hold down the costs of health care for all of us in the long run . Now , finally , many in this Chamber , particularly on the Republican side of the aisle , have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care . Now there you go . There you go . Now , I do not believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet , but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs . So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine . I know that the Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual States to test these ideas . I think it is a good idea , and I am directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today . Now , add it all up , and the plan I am proposing will cost around 900 billion over 10 years , less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration . Now , most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent , but spent badly , in the existing health care system . The plan will not add to our deficit . The middle class will realize greater security , not higher taxes . And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one tenth of 1 percent each year one tenth of 1 percent it will actually reduce the deficit by 4 trillion over the long term . Now , this is the plan I am proposing . It is a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight , Democrats and Republicans . And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead . If you come to me with a serious set of proposals , I will be there to listen . My door is always open . But know this I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it is better politics to kill this plan than to improve it . I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are . If you misrepresent what is in this plan , we will call you out . And I will not accept the status quo as a solution . Not this time . Not now . Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing . Our deficit will grow , more families will go bankrupt , more businesses will close , more Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it the most , and more will die as a result . We know these things to be true . That is why we cannot fail , because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed , the ones who suffer silently and the ones who share their stories with us at town halls , in e mails , and in letters . I received one of those letters a few days ago . It was from our beloved friend and colleague Ted Kennedy . He had written it back in May , shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal . He asked that it be delivered upon his death . In it he spoke about what a happy time his last months were , thanks to the love and support of family and friends , his wife Vicki , his amazing children , who are all here tonight . And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform , that great unfinished business of our society , he called it , would finally pass . He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity , but he also reminded me that it concerns more than material things . What we face , he wrote , is above all a moral issue at stake are not just the details of policy , but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country . I have thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days the character of our country . One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self reliance , our rugged individualism , our fierce defense of freedom , and our healthy skepticism of government . And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and , yes , sometimes angry , debate . That is our history . For some of Ted Kennedy s critics , his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty . In their minds , his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government . But those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here , people of both parties , know that what drove him was something more . His friend Orrin Hatch , he knows that . They worked together to provide children with health insurance . His friend John McCain knows that . They worked together on a patient s bill of rights . His friend Chuck Grassley knows that . They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities . On issues like these , Ted Kennedy s passion was born not of some rigid ideology , but of his own experience . It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer . He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick . And he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance , what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent , there is something that could make you better , but I just cannot afford it . That large heartedness , that concern and regard for the plight of others , is not a partisan feeling it is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling . It too is part of the American character , our ability to stand in other people s shoes , a recognition that we are all in this together , and when fortune turns against one of us , others are there to lend a helping hand , a belief that in this country , hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play , and an acknowledgment that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise . This has always been the history of our progress . In 1935 , when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away , there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism , but the men and women of Congress stood fast , and we are all the better for it . In 1965 , when some argued that Medicare represented a Government takeover of health care , Members of Congress , Democrats and Republicans , did not back down . They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind . You see , our predecessors understood that government could not , and should not , solve every problem . They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom . But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little , that without the leavening hand of wise policy , markets can crash , monopolies can stifle competition , the vulnerable can be exploited . And they knew that when any government measure , no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial , is subject to scorn when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un American , when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom , and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter , that at that point we do not merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges , we lose something essential about ourselves . That was true then it remains true today . I understand how difficult this health care debate has been . I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them . I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road , to defer reform one more year or one more election or one more term . But that is not what the moment calls for . That is not what we came here to do . We did not come to fear the future . We came here to shape it . I still believe we can act even when it is hard . I still believe . I still believe that we can act when it is hard . I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility and gridlock with progress . I still believe we can do great things and that here and now we will meet history s test , because that is who we are . That is our calling . That is our character . Thank you , God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you . Muchas gracias . Thank you so much . Thank you very much . President Castro , the people of Cuba , thank you so much for the warm welcome that I have received , that my family have received , and that our delegation has received . It is an extraordinary honor to be here today . Before I begin , please indulge me . I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels . The thoughts and the prayers of the American people are with the people of Belgium . We stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people . We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally , Belgium , in bringing to justice those who are responsible . And this is yet another reminder that the world must unite , we must be together , regardless of nationality , or race , or faith , in fighting against the scourge of terrorism . We can and will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world . To the government and the people of Cuba , I want to thank you for the kindness that you have shown to me and Michelle , Malia , Sasha , my mother in law , Marian . Cultivo una rosa blanca . In his most famous poem , Jose Marti made this offering of friendship and peace to both his friend and his enemy . Today , as the President of the United States of America , I offer the Cuban people el saludo de paz . Havana is only 90 miles from Florida , but to get here we had to travel a great distance over barriers of history and ideology barriers of pain and separation . The blue waters beneath Air Force One once carried American battleships to this island to liberate , but also to exert control over Cuba . Those waters also carried generations of Cuban revolutionaries to the United States , where they built support for their cause . And that short distance has been crossed by hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles on planes and makeshift rafts who came to America in pursuit of freedom and opportunity , sometimes leaving behind everything they owned and every person that they loved . Like so many people in both of our countries , my lifetime has spanned a time of isolation between us . The Cuban Revolution took place the same year that my father came to the United States from Kenya . The Bay of Pigs took place the year that I was born . The next year , the entire world held its breath , watching our two countries , as humanity came as close as we ever have to the horror of nuclear war . As the decades rolled by , our governments settled into a seemingly endless confrontation , fighting battles through proxies . In a world that remade itself time and again , one constant was the conflict between the United States and Cuba . I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas . I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people . I want to be clear The differences between our governments over these many years are real and they are important . I am sure President Castro would say the same thing I know , because I have heard him address those differences at length . But before I discuss those issues , we also need to recognize how much we share . Because in many ways , the United States and Cuba are like two brothers who have been estranged for many years , even as we share the same blood . We both live in a new world , colonized by Europeans . Cuba , like the United States , was built in part by slaves brought here from Africa . Like the United States , the Cuban people can trace their heritage to both slaves and slave owners . We have welcomed both immigrants who came a great distance to start new lives in the Americas . Over the years , our cultures have blended together . Carlos Finlay s work in Cuba paved the way for generations of doctors , including Walter Reed , who drew on Finlay s work to help combat Yellow Fever . Just as Marti wrote some of his most famous words in New York , Ernest Hemingway made a home in Cuba , and found inspiration in the waters of these shores . We share a national past time La Pelota and later today our players will compete on the same Havana field that Jackie Robinson played on before he made his Major League debut . And it is said that our greatest boxer , Muhammad Ali , once paid tribute to a Cuban that he could never fight saying that he would only be able to reach a draw with the great Cuban , Teofilo Stevenson . So even as our governments became adversaries , our people continued to share these common passions , particularly as so many Cubans came to America . In Miami or Havana , you can find places to dance the Cha Cha Cha or the Salsa , and eat ropa vieja . People in both of our countries have sung along with Celia Cruz or Gloria Estefan , and now listen to reggaeton or Pitbull . Millions of our people share a common religion a faith that I paid tribute to at the Shrine of our Lady of Charity in Miami , a peace that Cubans find in La Cachita . For all of our differences , the Cuban and American people share common values in their own lives . A sense of patriotism and a sense of pride a lot of pride . A profound love of family . A passion for our children , a commitment to their education . And that is why I believe our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration , as just one chapter in a longer story of family and of friendship . But we cannot , and should not , ignore the very real differences that we have about how we organize our governments , our economies , and our societies . Cuba has a one party system the United States is a multi party democracy . Cuba has a socialist economic model the United States is an open market . Cuba has emphasized the role and rights of the state the United States is founded upon the rights of the individual . Despite these differences , on December 17th 2014 , President Castro and I announced that the United States and Cuba would begin a process to normalize relations between our countries . Since then , we have established diplomatic relations and opened embassies . We have begun initiatives to cooperate on health and agriculture , education and law enforcement . We have reached agreements to restore direct flights and mail service . We have expanded commercial ties , and increased the capacity of Americans to travel and do business in Cuba . And these changes have been welcomed , even though there are still opponents to these policies . But still , many people on both sides of this debate have asked Why now Why now There is one simple answer What the United States was doing was not working . We have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth . A policy of isolation designed for the Cold War made little sense in the 21st century . The embargo was only hurting the Cuban people instead of helping them . And I have always believed in what Martin Luther King , called the fierce urgency of now we should not fear change , we should embrace it . That leads me to a bigger and more important reason for these changes Creo en el pueblo Cubano . I believe in the Cuban people . This is not just a policy of normalizing relations with the Cuban government . The United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people . And today , I want to share with you my vision of what our future can be . I want the Cuban people especially the young people to understand why I believe that you should look to the future with hope not the false promise which insists that things are better than they really are , or the blind optimism that says all your problems can go away tomorrow . Hope that is rooted in the future that you can choose and that you can shape , and that you can build for your country . I am hopeful because I believe that the Cuban people are as innovative as any people in the world . In a global economy , powered by ideas and information , a country s greatest asset is its people . In the United States , we have a clear monument to what the Cuban people can build it is called Miami . Here in Havana , we see that same talent in cuentapropistas , cooperatives and old cars that still run . El Cubano inventa del aire . Cuba has an extraordinary resource a system of education which values every boy and every girl . And in recent years , the Cuban government has begun to open up to the world , and to open up more space for that talent to thrive . In just a few years , we have seen how cuentapropistas can succeed while sustaining a distinctly Cuban spirit . Being self employed is not about becoming more like America , it is about being yourself . Look at Sandra Lidice Aldama , who chose to start a small business . Cubans , she said , can innovate and adapt without losing our identity hellip our secret is in not copying or imitating but simply being ourselves . Look at Papito Valladeres , a barber , whose success allowed him to improve conditions in his neighborhood . I realize I am not going to solve all of the world s problems , he said . But if I can solve problems in the little piece of the world where I live , it can ripple across Havana . That is where hope begins with the ability to earn your own living , and to build something you can be proud of . That is why our policies focus on supporting Cubans , instead of hurting them . That is why we got rid of limits on remittances so ordinary Cubans have more resources . That is why we are encouraging travel which will build bridges between our people , and bring more revenue to those Cuban small businesses . That is why we have opened up space for commerce and exchanges so that Americans and Cubans can work together to find cures for diseases , and create jobs , and open the door to more opportunity for the Cuban people . As President of the United States , I have called on our Congress to lift the embargo . It is an outdated burden on the Cuban people . It is a burden on the Americans who want to work and do business or invest here in Cuba . It is time to lift the embargo . But even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow , Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba . It should be easier to open a business here in Cuba . A worker should be able to get a job directly with companies who invest here in Cuba . Two currencies should not separate the type of salaries that Cubans can earn . The Internet should be available across the island , so that Cubans can connect to the wider world and to one of the greatest engines of growth in human history . There is no limitation from the United States on the ability of Cuba to take these steps . It is up to you . And I can tell you as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the 21st century depends upon education , health care , and environmental protection . But it also depends on the free and open exchange of ideas . If you cannot access information online , if you cannot be exposed to different points of view , you will not reach your full potential . And over time , the youth will lose hope . I know these issues are sensitive , especially coming from an American President . Before 1959 , some Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit , ignored poverty , enabled corruption . And since 1959 , we have been shadow boxers in this battle of geopolitics and personalities . I know the history , but I refuse to be trapped by it . I have made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity , nor the intention to impose change on Cuba . What changes come will depend upon the Cuban people . We will not impose our political or economic system on you . We recognize that every country , every people , must chart its own course and shape its own model . But having removed the shadow of history from our relationship , I must speak honestly about the things that I believe the things that we , as Americans , believe . As Marti said , Liberty is the right of every man to be honest , to think and to speak without hypocrisy . So let me tell you what I believe . I cannot force you to agree , but you should know what I think . I believe that every person should be equal under the law . Every child deserves the dignity that comes with education , and health care and food on the table and a roof over their heads . I believe citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear to organize , and to criticize their government , and to protest peacefully , and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detentions of people who exercise those rights . I believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly . And , yes , I believe voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections . Not everybody agrees with me on this . Not everybody agrees with the American people on this . But I believe those human rights are universal . I believe they are the rights of the American people , the Cuban people , and people around the world . Now , there is no secret that our governments disagree on many of these issues . I have had frank conversations with President Castro . For many years , he has pointed out the flaws in the American system economic inequality the death penalty racial discrimination wars abroad . That is just a sample . He has a much longer list . But here s what the Cuban people need to understand I welcome this open debate and dialogue . It is good . It is healthy . I am not afraid of it . We do have too much money in American politics . But , in America , it is still possible for somebody like me a child who was raised by a single mom , a child of mixed race who did not have a lot of money to pursue and achieve the highest office in the land . That is what is possible in America . We do have challenges with racial bias in our communities , in our criminal justice system , in our society the legacy of slavery and segregation . But the fact that we have open debates within America s own democracy is what allows us to get better . In 1959 , the year that my father moved to America , it was illegal for him to marry my mother , who was white , in many American states . When I first started school , we were still struggling to desegregate schools across the American South . But people organized they protested they debated these issues they challenged government officials . And because of those protests , and because of those debates , and because of popular mobilization , I am able to stand here today as an African American and as President of the United States . That was because of the freedoms that were afforded in the United States that we were able to bring about change . I am not saying this is easy . There is still enormous problems in our society . But democracy is the way that we solve them . That is how we got health care for more of our people . That is how we made enormous gains in women s rights and gay rights . That is how we address the inequality that concentrates so much wealth at the top of our society . Because workers can organize and ordinary people have a voice , American democracy has given our people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and enjoy a high standard of living . Now , there are still some tough fights . It is not always pretty , the process of democracy . It is often frustrating . You can see that in the election going on back home . But just stop and consider this fact about the American campaign that is taking place right now . You had two Cuban Americans in the Republican Party , running against the legacy of a black man who is President , while arguing that they are the best person to beat the Democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a Democratic Socialist . Who would have believed that back in 1959 That is a measure of our progress as a democracy . So here s my message to the Cuban government and the Cuban people The ideals that are the starting point for every revolution America s revolution , Cuba s revolution , the liberation movements around the world those ideals find their truest expression , I believe , in democracy . Not because American democracy is perfect , but precisely because we are not . And we like every country need the space that democracy gives us to change . It gives individuals the capacity to be catalysts to think in new ways , and to reimagine how our society should be , and to make them better . There is already an evolution taking place inside of Cuba , a generational change . Many suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down but I am appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up , build something new . El futurode Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo Cubano . And to President Castro who I appreciate being here today I want you to know , I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States . And given your commitment to Cuba s sovereignty and self determination , I am also confident that you need not fear the different voices of the Cuban people and their capacity to speak , and assemble , and vote for their leaders . In fact , I am hopeful for the future because I trust that the Cuban people will make the right decisions . And as you do , I am also confident that Cuba can continue to play an important role in the hemisphere and around the globe and my hope is , is that you can do so as a partner with the United States . We have played very different roles in the world . But no one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and suffering . Last year , American health care workers and the military worked side by side with Cubans to save lives and stamp out Ebola in West Africa . I believe that we should continue that kind of cooperation in other countries . We have been on the different side of so many conflicts in the Americas . But today , Americans and Cubans are sitting together at the negotiating table , and we are helping the Colombian people resolve a civil war that is dragged on for decades . That kind of cooperation is good for everybody . It gives everyone in this hemisphere hope . We took different journeys to our support for the people of South Africa in ending apartheid . But President Castro and I could both be there in Johannesburg to pay tribute to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela . And in examining his life and his words , I am sure we both realize we have more work to do to promote equality in our own countries to reduce discrimination based on race in our own countries . And in Cuba , we want our engagement to help lift up the Cubans who are of African descent who have proven that there is nothing they cannot achieve when given the chance . We have been a part of different blocs of nations in the hemisphere , and we will continue to have profound differences about how to promote peace , security , opportunity , and human rights . But as we normalize our relations , I believe it can help foster a greater sense of unity in the Americas todos somos Americanos . From the beginning of my time in office , I have urged the people of the Americas to leave behind the ideological battles of the past . We are in a new era . I know that many of the issues that I have talked about lack the drama of the past . And I know that part of Cuba s identity is its pride in being a small island nation that could stand up for its rights , and shake the world . But I also know that Cuba will always stand out because of the talent , hard work , and pride of the Cuban people . That is your strength . Cuba does not have to be defined by being against the United States , any more than the United States should be defined by being against Cuba . I am hopeful for the future because of the reconciliation that is taking place among the Cuban people . I know that for some Cubans on the island , there may be a sense that those who left somehow supported the old order in Cuba . I am sure there is a narrative that lingers here which suggests that Cuban exiles ignored the problems of pre Revolutionary Cuba , and rejected the struggle to build a new future . But I can tell you today that so many Cuban exiles carry a memory of painful and sometimes violent separation . They love Cuba . A part of them still considers this their true home . That is why their passion is so strong . That is why their heartache is so great . And for the Cuban American community that I have come to know and respect , this is not just about politics . This is about family the memory of a home that was lost the desire to rebuild a broken bond the hope for a better future the hope for return and reconciliation . For all of the politics , people are people , and Cubans are Cubans . And I have come here I have traveled this distance on a bridge that was built by Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits . I first got to know the talent and passion of the Cuban people in America . And I know how they have suffered more than the pain of exile they also know what it is like to be an outsider , and to struggle , and to work harder to make sure their children can reach higher in America . So the reconciliation of the Cuban people the children and grandchildren of revolution , and the children and grandchildren of exile that is fundamental to Cuba s future . You see it in Gloria Gonzalez , who traveled here in 2013 for the first time after 61 years of separation , and was met by her sister , Llorca . You recognized me , but I did not recognize you , Gloria said after she embraced her sibling . Imagine that , after 61 years . You see it in Melinda Lopez , who came to her family s old home . And as she was walking the streets , an elderly woman recognized her as her mother s daughter , and began to cry . She took her into her home and showed her a pile of photos that included Melinda s baby picture , which her mother had sent 50 years ago . Melinda later said , So many of us are now getting so much back . You see it in Cristian Miguel Soler , a young man who became the first of his family to travel here after 50 years . And meeting relatives for the first time , he said , I realized that family is family no matter the distance between us . Sometimes the most important changes start in small places . The tides of history can leave people in conflict and exile and poverty . It takes time for those circumstances to change . But the recognition of a common humanity , the reconciliation of people bound by blood and a belief in one another that is where progress begins . Understanding , and listening , and forgiveness . And if the Cuban people face the future together , it will be more likely that the young people of today will be able to live with dignity and achieve their dreams right here in Cuba . The history of the United States and Cuba encompass revolution and conflict struggle and sacrifice retribution and , now , reconciliation . It is time , now , for us to leave the past behind . It is time for us to look forward to the future together un future de esperanza . And it will not be easy , and there will be setbacks . It will take time . But my time here in Cuba renews my hope and my confidence in what the Cuban people will do . We can make this journey as friends , and as neighbors , and as family together . Si se puede . Muchas gracias .<speech_sep>Thank you . Well , I am excited , too . Of the many responsibilities granted to a President by our Constitution , few are more serious or more consequential than selecting a Supreme Court justice . The members of our highest court are granted life tenure , often serving long after the Presidents who appointed them . And they are charged with the vital task of applying principles put to paper more than 20 centuries ago to some of the most difficult questions of our time . So I do not take this decision lightly . I have made it only after deep reflection and careful deliberation . While there are many qualities that I admire in judges across the spectrum of judicial philosophy , and that I seek in my own nominee , there are few that stand out that I just want to mention . First and foremost is a rigorous intellect a mastery of the law , an ability to hone in on the key issues and provide clear answers to complex legal questions . Second is a recognition of the limits of the judicial role , an understanding that a judge s job is to interpret , not make , law to approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda , but rather a commitment to impartial justice a respect for precedent and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand . These two qualities are essential , I believe , for anyone who would sit on our nation s highest court . And yet , these qualities alone are insufficient . We need something more . For as Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said , The life of the law has not been logic it has been experience . Experience being tested by obstacles and barriers , by hardship and misfortune experience insisting , persisting , and ultimately overcoming those barriers . It is experience that can give a person a common touch and a sense of compassion an understanding of how the world works and how ordinary people live . And that is why it is a necessary ingredient in the kind of justice we need on the Supreme Court . The process of reviewing and selecting a successor to Justice Souter has been rigorous and comprehensive , not least because of the standard that Justice Souter himself has set with his formidable intellect and fair mindedness and decency . I have sought the advice of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle , including every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee . My team has reached out to constitutional scholars , advocacy organizations , and bar associations representing an array of interests and opinions . And I want to thank members of my staff and administration who have worked so hard and given so much of their time as part of this effort . After completing this exhaustive process , I have decided to nominate an inspiring woman who I believe will make a great justice Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the great state of New York . Over a distinguished career that spans three decades , Judge Sotomayor has worked at almost every level of our judicial system , providing her with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a Supreme Court justice . It is a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the District Court by a Republican President , George Bush , and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat , Bill Clinton . Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench , and more varied experience on the bench , than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed . Judge Sotomayor is a distinguished graduate of two of America s leading universities . She is been a big city prosecutor and a corporate litigator . She spent six years as a trial judge on the District Court , and would replace Justice Souter as the only justice with experience as a trial judge , a perspective that would enrich the judgments of the Court . For the past 11 years she has been a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of New York , one of the most demanding circuits in the country . There she has handed down decisions on a range of constitutional and legal questions that are notable for their careful reasoning , earning the respect of colleagues on the bench , the admiration of many lawyers who argue cases in her court , and the adoration of her clerks who look to her as a mentor . During her tenure on the District Court , she presided over roughly 450 cases . One case in particular involved a matter of enormous concern to many Americans , including me the baseball strike of 1994 1995 . In a decision that reportedly took her just 15 minutes to announce , a swiftness much appreciated by baseball fans everywhere she issued an injunction that helped end the strike . Some say that Judge Sotomayor saved baseball . Judge Sotomayor came to the District Court from a law firm where she was a partner focused on complex commercial litigation , gaining insight into the workings of a global economy . Before that she was a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA s office , serving under the legendary Robert Morgenthau , an early mentor of Sonia s who still sings her praises today . There , Sonia learned what crime can do to a family and a community , and what it takes to fight it . It is a career that has given her not only a sweeping overview of the American judicial system , but a practical understanding of how the law works in the everyday lives of the American people . But as impressive and meaningful as Judge Sotomayor s sterling credentials in the law is her own extraordinary journey . Born in the South Bronx , she was raised in a housing project not far from Yankee Stadium , making her a lifelong Yankee s fan . I hope this will not disqualify her in the eyes of the New Englanders in the Senate . Sonia s parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during the second world war , her mother as part of the Women s Army Corps . And , in fact , her mother is here today and I had like us all to acknowledge Sonia s mom . Sonia s mom has been a little choked up . But she , Sonia s mother , began a family tradition of giving back to this country . Sonia s father was a factory worker with a 3rd grade education who did not speak English . But like Sonia s mother , he had a willingness to work hard , a strong sense of family , and a belief in the American Dream . When Sonia was nine , her father passed away . And her mother worked six days a week as a nurse to provide for Sonia and her brother who is also here today , is a doctor and a terrific success in his own right . But Sonia s mom bought the only set of encyclopedias in the neighborhood , sent her children to a Catholic school called Cardinal Spellman out of the belief that with a good education here in America all things are possible . With the support of family , friends , and teachers , Sonia earned scholarships to Princeton , where she graduated at the top of her class , and Yale Law School , where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal , stepping onto the path that led her here today . Along the way she is faced down barriers , overcome the odds , lived out the American Dream that brought her parents here so long ago . And even as she has accomplished so much in her life , she has never forgotten where she began , never lost touch with the community that supported her . What Sonia will bring to the Court , then , is not only the knowledge and experience acquired over a course of a brilliant legal career , but the wisdom accumulated from an inspiring life s journey . It is my understanding that Judge Sotomayor s interest in the law was sparked as a young girl by reading the Nancy Drew series and that when she was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of eight , she was informed that people with diabetes cannot grow up to be police officers or private investigators like Nancy Drew . And that is when she was told she had have to scale back her dreams . Well , Sonia , what you have shown in your life is that it does not matter where you come from , what you look like , or what challenges life throws your way no dream is beyond reach in the United States of America . And when Sonia Sotomayor ascends those marble steps to assume her seat on the highest court of the land , America will have taken another important step towards realizing the ideal that is etched above its entrance Equal justice under the law . I hope the Senate acts in a bipartisan fashion , as it has in confirming Judge Sotomayor twice before , and as swiftly as possible so that she can take her seat on the Court in September and participate in deliberations as the Court chooses which cases it will hear this coming year . And with that , I had like all of you to give a warm greeting as I invite Judge Sotomayor to say a few words .<speech_sep>Good evening . Tonight , I had like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq , the ongoing security challenges we face , and the need to rebuild our nation here at home . I know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans . We have now been through nearly a decade of war . We have endured a long and painful recession . And sometimes in the midst of these storms , the future that we are trying to build for our nation a future of lasting peace and long term prosperity may seem beyond our reach . But this milestone should serve as a reminder to all Americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment . It should also serve as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century . From this desk , seven and a half years ago , President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq . Much has changed since that night . A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency . Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart . Thousands of Americans gave their lives tens of thousands have been wounded . Our relations abroad were strained . Our unity at home was tested . These are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of America s longest wars . Yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides . At every turn , America s men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve . As Commander in Chief , I am incredibly proud of their service . And like all Americans , I am awed by their sacrifice , and by the sacrifices of their families . The Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given . They defeated a regime that had terrorized its people . Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own , our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future . They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people , trained Iraqi Security Forces , and took out terrorist leaders . Because of our troops and civilians and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny , even though many challenges remain . So tonight , I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended . Operation Iraqi Freedom is over , and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country . This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office . Last February , I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq , while redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraq s Security Forces and support its government and people . That is what we have done . We have removed nearly 100 , 000 troops from Iraq . We have closed or transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases . And we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq . This completes a transition to Iraqi responsibility for their own security . troops pulled out of Iraq s cities last summer , and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens . Even as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks , security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began . And Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda , removing much of its leadership in Iraqi led operations . This year also saw Iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout . A caretaker administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the results of that election . Tonight , I encourage Iraq s leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just , representative , and accountable to the Iraqi people . And when that government is in place , there should be no doubt The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States . Our combat mission is ending , but our commitment to Iraq s future is not . Going forward , a transitional force of troops will remain in Iraq with a different mission advising and assisting Iraq s Security Forces , supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions , and protecting our civilians . Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government , all troops will leave by the end of next year . As our military draws down , our dedicated civilians diplomats , aid workers , and advisors are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its government , resolves political disputes , resettles those displaced by war , and builds ties with the region and the world . That is a message that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his visit there today . This new approach reflects our long term partnership with Iraq one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect . Of course , violence will not end with our combat mission . Extremists will continue to set off bombs , attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife . But ultimately , these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals . Iraqis are a proud people . They have rejected sectarian war , and they have no interest in endless destruction . They understand that , in the end , only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets . Only Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders . What America can do , and will do , is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner . Ending this war is not only in Iraq s interest it is in our own . The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people . We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq , and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home . We have persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization . Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq , we have met our responsibility . Now , it is time to turn the page . As we do , I am mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home . Here , too , it is time to turn the page . This afternoon , I spoke to former President George Bush . It is well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its outset . Yet no one can doubt President Bush s support for our troops , or his love of country and commitment to our security . As I have said , there were patriots who supported this war , and patriots who opposed it . And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women , and our hopes for Iraqis future . The greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences , and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead . And no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al Qaeda . Americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9 11 . Now , as we approach our 10th year of combat in Afghanistan , there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there . But we must never lose sight of what is at stake . As we speak , al Qaeda continues to plot against us , and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan . We will disrupt , dismantle and defeat al Qaeda , while preventing Afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists . And because of our drawdown in Iraq , we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense . In fact , over the last 19 months , nearly a dozen al Qaeda leaders and hundreds of al Qaeda s extremist allies have been killed or captured around the world . Within Afghanistan , I have ordered the deployment of additional troops who under the command of General David Petraeus are fighting to break the Taliban s momentum . As with the surge in Iraq , these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future . But , as was the case in Iraq , we cannot do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves . That is why we are training Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistan s problems . And next August , we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility . The pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground , and our support for Afghanistan will endure . But make no mistake This transition will begin because open ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan people s . Indeed , one of the lessons of our effort in Iraq is that American influence around the world is not a function of military force alone . We must use all elements of our power including our diplomacy , our economic strength , and the power of America s example to secure our interests and stand by our allies . And we must project a vision of the future that is based not just on our fears , but also on our hopes a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world , but also the limitless possibilities of our time . Today , old adversaries are at peace , and emerging democracies are potential partners . New markets for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas . A new push for peace in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow . Billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict . As the leader of the free world , America will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people . Now , that effort must begin within our own borders . Throughout our history , America has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas , understanding its links to our own liberty and security . But we have also understood that our nation s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home . And the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class . Unfortunately , over the last decade , we have not done what is necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity . We spent a trillion dollars at war , often financed by borrowing from overseas . This , in turn , has short changed investments in our own people , and contributed to record deficits . For too long , we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform . As a result , too many middle class families find themselves working harder for less , while our nation s long term competitiveness is put at risk . And so at this moment , as we wind down the war in Iraq , we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy , and grit , and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad . They have met every test that they faced . Now , it is our turn . Now , it is our responsibility to honor them by coming together , all of us , and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it . Our most urgent task is to restore our economy , and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work . To strengthen our middle class , we must give all our children the education they deserve , and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy . We must jumpstart industries that create jobs , and end our dependence on foreign oil . We must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines , and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs . This will be difficult . But in the days to come , it must be our central mission as a people , and my central responsibility as President . Part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor . As long as I am President , we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known , and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us . This is a sacred trust . That is why we have already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades . We are treating the signature wounds of today s wars post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned . And we are funding a Post 9 11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education . Just as the GI Bill helped those who fought World War II including my grandfather become the backbone of our middle class , so today s servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy . Because part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it . Two weeks ago , America s final combat brigade in Iraq the Army s Fourth Stryker Brigade journeyed home in the pre dawn darkness . Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from Baghdad , the last of them passing into Kuwait in the early morning hours . Over seven years before , American troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways , but this time no shots were fired . It was just a convoy of brave Americans , making their way home . Of course , the soldiers left much behind . Some were teenagers when the war began . Many have served multiple tours of duty , far from families who bore a heroic burden of their own , enduring the absence of a husband s embrace or a mother s kiss . Most painfully , since the war began , 55 members of the Fourth Stryker Brigade made the ultimate sacrifice part of over 4 , 400 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq . As one staff sergeant said , I know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died , this day would probably mean a lot . Those Americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries . Along with nearly 1 . 5 million Americans who have served in Iraq , they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew . They stared into the darkest of human creations war and helped the Iraqi people seek the light of peace . In an age without surrender ceremonies , we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation . Every American who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg from Iwo Jima to Inchon from Khe Sanh to Kandahar Americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own . Our troops are the steel in our ship of state . And though our nation may be travelling through rough waters , they give us confidence that our course is true , and that beyond the pre dawn darkness , better days lie ahead . Thank you . May God bless you . And may God bless the United States of America , and all who serve her .<speech_sep>Good evening . To the United States Corps of Cadets , to the men and women of our Armed Services , and to my fellow Americans I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan the nature of our commitment there , the scope of our interests , and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion . It is an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security , and to represent what is finest about our country . To address these important issues , it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place . We did not ask for this fight . On September 11 , 2001 , 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3 , 000 people . They struck at our military and economic nerve centers . They took the lives of innocent men , women , and children without regard to their faith or race or station . Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers onboard one of those flights , they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington , and killed many more . As we know , these men belonged to al Qaeda a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam , one of the world s great religions , to justify the slaughter of innocents . Al Qaeda s base of operations was in Afghanistan , where they were harbored by the Taliban a ruthless , repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war , and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere . Just days after 9 11 , Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them an authorization that continues to this day . The vote in the Senate was 98 to nothing . The vote in the House was 420 to 1 . For the first time in its history , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all . And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9 11 attacks . America , our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda s terrorist network and to protect our common security . Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden we sent our troops into Afghanistan . Within a matter of months , al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed . The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels . A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope . At a conference convened by the N . , a provisional government was established under President Hamid Karzai . And an International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war torn country . Then , in early 2003 , the decision was made to wage a second war , in Iraq . The wrenching debate over the Iraq war is well known and need not be repeated here . It is enough to say that for the next six years , the Iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops , our resources , our diplomacy , and our national attention and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world . Today , after extraordinary costs , we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end . We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer , and all of our troops by the end of 2011 . That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and women in uniform . Thanks to their courage , grit and perseverance , we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future , and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people . But while we have achieved hard earned milestones in Iraq , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated . After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002 , al Qaeda s leadership established a safe haven there . Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people , it is been hampered by corruption , the drug trade , an under developed economy , and insufficient security forces . Over the last several years , the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda , as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government . Gradually , the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory in Afghanistan , while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorism against the Pakistani people . Now , throughout this period , our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq . When I took office , we had just over 32 , 000 Americans serving in Afghanistan , compared to 160 , 000 in Iraq at the peak of the war . Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban , but these reinforcements did not arrive . And that is why , shortly after taking office , I approved a longstanding request for more troops . After consultations with our allies , I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan . I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting , dismantling , and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies , and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts . Since then , we have made progress on some important objectives . High ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed , and we have stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda worldwide . In Pakistan , that nation s army has gone on its largest offensive in years . In Afghanistan , we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election , and although it was marred by fraud that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan s laws and constitution . Yet huge challenges remain . Afghanistan is not lost , but for several years it has moved backwards . There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown , but the Taliban has gained momentum . Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9 11 , but they retain their safe havens along the border . And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population . Our new commander in Afghanistan General McChrystal has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated . In short The status quo is not sustainable . As cadets , you volunteered for service during this time of danger . Some of you fought in Afghanistan . Some of you will deploy there . As your Commander in Chief , I owe you a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of your service . And that is why , after the Afghan voting was completed , I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy . Now , let me be clear There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 , so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period . Instead , the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions , and to explore all the different options , along with my national security team , our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan , and our key partners . And given the stakes involved , I owed the American people and our troops no less . This review is now complete . And as Commander in Chief , I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30 , 000 troops to Afghanistan . After 18 months , our troops will begin to come home . These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative , while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan . I do not make this decision lightly . I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force , and always consider the long term consequences of our actions . We have been at war now for eight years , at enormous cost in lives and resources . Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters , and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort . And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home . Most of all , I know that this decision asks even more of you a military that , along with your families , has already borne the heaviest of all burdens . As President , I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars . I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed . I visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed . I have traveled to Dover to meet the flag draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place . I see firsthand the terrible wages of war . If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan , I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow . So , no , I do not make this decision lightly . I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan . This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda . It is from here that we were attacked on 9 11 , and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak . This is no idle danger no hypothetical threat . In the last few months alone , we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror . And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards , and al Qaeda can operate with impunity . We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and to do that , we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region . Of course , this burden is not ours alone to bear . This is not just America s war . Since 9 11 , al Qaeda s safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali . The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered . And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear armed Pakistan , because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons , and we have every reason to believe that they would use them . These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies . Our overarching goal remains the same to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future . To meet that goal , we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan . We must deny al Qaeda a safe haven . We must reverse the Taliban s momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government . And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan s security forces and government so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan s future . We will meet these objectives in three ways . First , we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban s momentum and increase Afghanistan s capacity over the next 18 months . The 30 , 000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 the fastest possible pace so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers . They will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces , and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight . And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans . Because this is an international effort , I have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies . Some have already provided additional troops , and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead . Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan . And now , we must come together to end this war successfully . For what is at stake is not simply a test of NATO s credibility what is at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world . But taken together , these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces , and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011 . Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly , taking into account conditions on the ground . We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul . But it will be clear to the Afghan government and , more importantly , to the Afghan people that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country . Second , we will work with our partners , the United Nations , and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy , so that the government can take advantage of improved security . This effort must be based on performance . The days of providing a blank check are over . President Karzai s inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction . And going forward , we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance . We will support Afghan ministries , governors , and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people . We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable . And we will also focus our assistance in areas such as agriculture that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people . The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades . They have been confronted with occupation by the Soviet Union , and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes . So tonight , I want the Afghan people to understand America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering . We have no interest in occupying your country . We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens . And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the day when our troops will leave and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner , and never your patron . Third , we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan . We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country . But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan . That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border . In the past , there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight , and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence . But in recent years , as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad , it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism . Public opinion has turned . The Pakistani army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan . And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy . In the past , we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly . Those days are over . Moving forward , we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interest , mutual respect , and mutual trust . We will strengthen Pakistan s capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries , and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear . America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan s democracy and development . We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting . And going forward , the Pakistan people must know America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan s security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent , so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed . These are the three core elements of our strategy a military effort to create the conditions for a transition a civilian surge that reinforces positive action and an effective partnership with Pakistan . I recognize there are a range of concerns about our approach . So let me briefly address a few of the more prominent arguments that I have heard , and which I take very seriously . First , there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam . They argue that it cannot be stabilized , and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing . I believe this argument depends on a false reading of history . Unlike Vietnam , we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action . Unlike Vietnam , we are not facing a broad based popular insurgency . And most importantly , unlike Vietnam , the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border . To abandon this area now and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda , and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies . Second , there are those who acknowledge that we cannot leave Afghanistan in its current state , but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have . But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through , and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there . It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan , because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over . Finally , there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility . Indeed , some call for a more dramatic and open ended escalation of our war effort one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade . I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost , and what we need to achieve to secure our interests . Furthermore , the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government . It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security , and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan . As President , I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility , our means , or our interests . And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces . I do not have the luxury of committing to just one . Indeed , I am mindful of the words of President Eisenhower , who in discussing our national security said , Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs . Over the past several years , we have lost that balance . We have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy . In the wake of an economic crisis , too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills . Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children . Meanwhile , competition within the global economy has grown more fierce . So we cannot simply afford to ignore the price of these wars . All told , by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars . Going forward , I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly . Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion for the military this year , and I will work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit . But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility , we must rebuild our strength here at home . Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power . It pays for our military . It underwrites our diplomacy . It taps the potential of our people , and allows investment in new industry . And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last . That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open ended because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own . Now , let me be clear None of this will be easy . The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly , and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan . It will be an enduring test of our free society , and our leadership in the world . And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century , our effort will involve disorderly regions , failed states , diffuse enemies . So as a result , America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict not just how we wage wars . We will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power . Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships . And we cannot count on military might alone . We have to invest in our homeland security , because we cannot capture or kill every violent extremist abroad . We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence , so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks . We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction . And that is why I have made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists , to stop the spread of nuclear weapons , and to pursue the goal of a world without them because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapons true security will come for those who reject them . We will have to use diplomacy , because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone . I have spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships . And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim world one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict , and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity . And finally , we must draw on the strength of our values for the challenges that we face may have changed , but the things that we believe in must not . That is why we must promote our values by living them at home which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay . And we must make it clear to every man , woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights , and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples . That is who we are . That is the source , the moral source , of America s authority . Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt , and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great grandparents , our country has borne a special burden in global affairs . We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents . We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies . We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings . We have not always been thanked for these efforts , and we have at times made mistakes . But more than any other nation , the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades a time that , for all its problems , has seen walls come down , and markets open , and billions lifted from poverty , unparalleled scientific progress and advancing frontiers of human liberty . For unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought world domination . Our union was founded in resistance to oppression . We do not seek to occupy other nations . We will not claim another nation s resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours . What we have fought for what we continue to fight for is a better future for our children and grandchildren . And we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity . As a country , we are not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Roosevelt was President . Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom . And now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age . In the end , our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms . It derives from our people from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries from the teachers that will educate our children , and the service of those who work in our communities at home from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people , by the people , and for the people a reality on this Earth . This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue nor should we . But I also know that we , as a country , cannot sustain our leadership , nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time , if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse . It is easy to forget that when this war began , we were united bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack , and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear . I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again . I believe with every fiber of my being that we as Americans can still come together behind a common purpose . For our values are not simply words written into parchment they are a creed that calls us together , and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation , as one people . America we are passing through a time of great trial . And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear that our cause is just , our resolve unwavering . We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might , and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer , a world that is more secure , and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes . Thank you . God bless you . May God bless the United States of America . Thank you very much . Thank you .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . Everybody , please have a seat . Thank you very much . Well , thank you . It is good to be back . It is good to be back in New York , it is good to be back in the Great Hall at Cooper Union . We have got some special guests here that I want to acknowledge . Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is here in the house . Governor David Paterson is here . Attorney General Andrew Cuomo . State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is here . The Mayor of New York City , Michael Bloomberg . George Campbell , , president of Cooper Union . And all the citywide elected officials who are here . Thank you very much for your attendance . It is wonderful to be back in Cooper Union , where generations of leaders and citizens have come to defend their ideas and contest their differences . It is also good to be back in Lower Manhattan , a few blocks from Wall Street . It really is good to be back , because Wall Street is the heart of our nation s financial sector . Now , since I last spoke here two years ago , our country has been through a terrible trial . More than 8 million people have lost their jobs . Countless small businesses have had to shut their doors . Trillions of dollars in savings have been lost forcing seniors to put off retirement , young people to postpone college , entrepreneurs to give up on the dream of starting a company . And as a nation we were forced to take unprecedented steps to rescue the financial system and the broader economy . And as a result of the decisions we made some of which , let us face it , were very unpopular we are seeing hopeful signs . A little more than one year ago we were losing an average of 750 , 000 jobs each month . Today , America is adding jobs again . One year ago the economy was shrinking rapidly . Today the economy is growing . In fact , we have seen the fastest turnaround in growth in nearly three decades . But you are here and I am here because we have got more work to do . Until this progress is felt not just on Wall Street but on Main Street we cannot be satisfied . Until the millions of our neighbors who are looking for work can find a job , and wages are growing at a meaningful pace , we may be able to claim a technical recovery but we will not have truly recovered . And even as we seek to revive this economy , it is also incumbent on us to rebuild it stronger than before . We do not want an economy that has the same weaknesses that led to this crisis . And that means addressing some of the underlying problems that led to this turmoil and devastation in the first place . Now , one of the most significant contributors to this recession was a financial crisis as dire as any we have known in generations at least since the 30s . And that crisis was born of a failure of responsibility from Wall Street all the way to Washington that brought down many of the world s largest financial firms and nearly dragged our economy into a second Great Depression . It was that failure of responsibility that I spoke about when I came to New York more than two years ago before the worst of the crisis had unfolded . It was back in 2007 . And I take no satisfaction in noting that my comments then have largely been borne out by the events that followed . But I repeat what I said then because it is essential that we learn the lessons from this crisis so we do not doom ourselves to repeat it . And make no mistake , that is exactly what will happen if we allow this moment to pass and that is an outcome that is unacceptable to me and it is unacceptable to you , the American people . As I said on this stage two years ago , I believe in the power of the free market . I believe in a strong financial sector that helps people to raise capital and get loans and invest their savings . That is part of what has made America what it is . But a free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it . That is what happened too often in the years leading up to this crisis . Some and let me be clear , not all but some on Wall Street forgot that behind every dollar traded or leveraged there is family looking to buy a house , or pay for an education , open a business , save for retirement . What happens on Wall Street has real consequences across the country , across our economy . I have spoken before about the need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the 21st century . And given the importance of the financial sector , Wall Street reform is an absolutely essential part of that foundation . Without it , our house will continue to sit on shifting sands , and our families , businesses , and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crises . That is why I feel so strongly that we need to enact a set of updated , commonsense rules to ensure accountability on Wall Street and to protect consumers in our financial system . Now , here s the good news A comprehensive plan to achieve these reforms has already passed the House of Representatives . A Senate version is currently being debated , drawing on ideas from Democrats and Republicans . Both bills represent significant improvement on the flawed rules that we have in place today , despite the furious effort of industry lobbyists to shape this legislation to their special interests . And for those of you in the financial sector I am sure that some of these lobbyists work for you and they are doing what they are being paid to do . But I am here today specifically when I speak to the titans of industry here because I want to urge you to join us , instead of fighting us in this effort . I am here because I believe that these reforms are , in the end , not only in the best interest of our country , but in the best interest of the financial sector . And I am here to explain what reform will look like , and why it matters . Now , first , the bill being considered in the Senate would create what we did not have before , and that is a way to protect the financial system and the broader economy and American taxpayers in the event that a large financial firm begins to fail . If there is a Lehmans or an AIhow can we respond in a way that does not force taxpayers to pick up the tab or , alternatively , could bring down the whole system . In an ordinary local bank when it approaches insolvency , we have got a process , an orderly process through the FDIthat ensures that depositors are protected , maintains confidence in the banking system , and it works . Customers and taxpayers are protected and owners and management lose their equity . But we do not have that kind of process designed to contain the failure of a Lehman Brothers or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country . That is why , when this crisis began , crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world s biggest companies companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets had to take place in hurried discussions in the middle of the night . And that is why , to save the entire economy from an even worse catastrophe , we had to deploy taxpayer dollars . Now , much of that money has now been paid back and my administration has proposed a fee to be paid by large financial firms to recover all the money , every dime , because the American people should never have been put in that position in the first place . But this is why we need a system to shut these firms down with the least amount of collateral damage to innocent people and innocent businesses . And from the start , I have insisted that the financial industry , not taxpayers , shoulder the costs in the event that a large financial company should falter . The goal is to make certain that taxpayers are never again on the hook because a firm is deemed too big to fail . Now , there is a legitimate debate taking place about how best to ensure taxpayers are held harmless in this process . And that is a legitimate debate , and I encourage that debate . But what is not legitimate is to suggest that somehow the legislation being proposed is going to encourage future taxpayer bailouts , as some have claimed . That makes for a good sound bite , but it is not factually accurate . It is not true . In fact , the system as it stands the system as it stands is what led to a series of massive , costly taxpayer bailouts . And it is only with reform that we can avoid a similar outcome in the future . In other words , a vote for reform is a vote to put a stop to taxpayer funded bailouts . That is the truth . End of story . And nobody should be fooled in this debate . By the way , these changes have the added benefit of creating incentives within the industry to ensure that no one company can ever threaten to bring down the whole economy . To that end , the bill would also enact what is known as the Volcker Rule and there is a tall guy sitting in the front row here , Paul Volcker who we named it after . And it does something very simple It places some limits on the size of banks and the kinds of risks that banking institutions can take . This will not only safeguard our system against crises , this will also make our system stronger and more competitive by instilling confidence here at home and across the globe . Markets depend on that confidence . Part of what led to the turmoil of the past two years was that in the absence of clear rules and sound practices , people did not trust that our system was one in which it was safe to invest or lend . As we have seen , that harms all of us . So by enacting these reforms , we will help ensure that our financial system and our economy continues to be the envy of the world . That is the first thing , making sure that we can wind down one firm if it gets into trouble without bringing the whole system down or forcing taxpayers to fund a bailout . Number two , reform would bring new transparency to many financial markets . As you know , part of what led to this crisis was firms like AIG and others who were making huge and risky bets , using derivatives and other complicated financial instruments , in ways that defied accountability , or even common sense . In fact , many practices were so opaque , so confusing , so complex that the people inside the firms did not understand them , much less those who were charged with overseeing them . They were not fully aware of the massive bets that were being placed . That is what led Warren Buffett to describe derivatives that were bought and sold with little oversight as financial weapons of mass destruction . That is what he called them . And that is why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these kinds of transactions take place in the light of day . Now , there is been a great deal of concern about these changes . So I want to reiterate There is a legitimate role for these financial instruments in our economy . They can help allay risk and spur investment . And there are a lot of companies that use these instruments to that legitimate end they are managing exposure to fluctuating prices or currencies , fluctuating markets . For example , a business might hedge against rising oil prices by buying a financial product to secure stable fuel costs , so an airlines might have an interest in locking in a decent price . That is how markets are supposed to work . The problem is these markets operated in the shadows of our economy , invisible to regulators , invisible to the public . So reckless practices were rampant . Risks accrued until they threatened our entire financial system . And that is why these reforms are designed to respect legitimate activities but prevent reckless risk taking . That is why we want to ensure that financial products like standardized derivatives are traded out in the open , in the full view of businesses , investors , and those charged with oversight . And I was encouraged to see a Republican senator join with Democrats this week in moving forward on this issue . That is a good sign . That is a good sign . For without action , we will continue to see what amounts to highly leveraged , loosely monitored gambling in our financial system , putting taxpayers and the economy in jeopardy . And the only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that we are proposing are those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny . Third , this plan would enact the strongest consumer financial protections ever . And that is absolutely necessary because this financial crisis was not just the result of decisions made in the executive suites on Wall Street it was also the result of decisions made around kitchen tables across America , by folks who took on mortgages and credit cards and auto loans . And while it is true that many Americans took on financial obligations that they knew or should have known they could not have afforded , millions of others were , frankly , duped . They were misled by deceptive terms and conditions , buried deep in the fine print . And while a few companies made out like bandits by exploiting their customers , our entire economy was made more vulnerable . Millions of people have now lost their homes . Tens of millions more have lost value in their homes . Just about every sector of our economy has felt the pain , whether you are paving driveways in Arizona , or selling houses in Ohio , or you are doing home repairs in California , or you are using your home equity to start a small business in Florida . That is why we need to give consumers more protection and more power in our financial system . This is not about stifling competition , stifling innovation it is just the opposite . With a dedicated agency setting ground rules and looking out for ordinary people in our financial system , we will empower consumers with clear and concise information when they are making financial decisions . So instead of competing to offer confusing products , companies will compete the old fashioned way , by offering better products . And that will mean more choices for consumers , more opportunities for businesses , and more stability in our financial system . And unless your business model depends on bilking people , there is little to fear from these new rules . Number four , the last key component of reform . These Wall Street reforms will give shareholders new power in the financial system . They will get what we call a say on pay , a voice with respect to the salaries and bonuses awarded to top executives . And the SEC will have the authority to give shareholders more say in corporate elections , so that investors and pension holders have a stronger role in determining who manages the company in which they have placed their savings . Now , Americans do not begrudge anybody for success when that success is earned . But when we read in the past , and sometimes in the present , about enormous executive bonuses at firms even as they are relying on assistance from taxpayers or they are taking huge risks that threaten the system as a whole or their company is doing badly it offends our fundamental values . Not only that , some of the salaries and bonuses that we have seen creates perverse incentives to take reckless risks that contributed to the crisis . It is what helped lead to a relentless focus on a company s next quarter , to the detriment of its next year or its next decade . And it led to a situation in which folks with the most to lose stock and pension holders had the least to say in the process . And that has to change . Let me close by saying this . I have laid out a set of Wall Street reforms . These are reforms that would put an end to taxpayer bailouts that would bring complex financial dealings out of the shadows that would protect consumers and that would give shareholders more power in the financial system . But let us face it , we also need reform in Washington . And the debate the debate over these changes is a perfect example . I mean , we have seen battalions of financial industry lobbyists descending on Capitol Hill , firms spending millions to influence the outcome of this debate . We have seen misleading arguments and attacks that are designed not to improve the bill but to weaken or to kill it . We have seen a bipartisan process buckle under the weight of these withering forces , even as we have produced a proposal that by all accounts is a commonsense , reasonable , non ideological approach to target the root problems that led to the turmoil in our financial sector and ultimately in our entire economy . So we have seen business as usual in Washington , but I believe we can and must put this kind of cynical politics aside . We have got to put an end to it . That is why I am here today . That is why I am here today . And to those of you who are in the financial sector , let me say this , we will not always see eye to eye . We will not always agree . But that does not mean that we have got to choose between two extremes . We do not have to choose between markets that are unfettered by even modest protections against crisis , or markets that are stymied by onerous rules that suppress enterprise and innovation . That is a false choice . And we need no more proof than the crisis that we have just been through . You see , there has always been a tension between the desire to allow markets to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rules to prevent markets from falling out of kilter . But managing that tension , one that we have debated since the founding of this nation , is what has allowed our country to keep up with a changing world . For in taking up this debate , in figuring out how to apply well worn principles with each new age , we ensure that we do not tip too far one way or the other that our democracy remains as dynamic and our economy remains as dynamic as it has in the past . So , yes , this debate can be contentious . It can be heated . But in the end it serves only to make our country stronger . It has allowed us to adapt and to thrive . And I read a report recently that I think fairly illustrates this point . It is from Time Magazine . I am going to quote Through the great banking houses of Manhattan last week ran wild eyed alarm . Big bankers stared at one another in anger and astonishment . A bill just passed hellip would rivet upon their institutions what they considered a monstrous system hellip such a system , they felt , would not only rob them of their pride of profession but would reduce all banking to its lowest level . That appeared in Time Magazine in June of 1933 . The system that caused so much consternation , so much concern was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , also known as the FDIan institution that has successfully secured the deposits of generations of Americans . In the end , our system only works our markets are only free when there are basic safeguards that prevent abuse , that check excesses , that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system . And that is what the reforms we have been proposing are designed to achieve no more , no less . And because that is how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers , that it works for investors , and that it works for financial institutions in other words , that it works for all of us that is why we are working so hard to get this stuff passed . This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history . It is what I said when I spoke here two years ago . Because ultimately , there is no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street . We will rise or we will fall together as one nation . And that is why I urge all of you to join me . I urge all of you to join me , to join those who are seeking to pass these commonsense reforms . And for those of you in the financial industry , I urge you to join me not only because it is in the interest of your industry , but also because it is in the interest of your country . Thank you so much . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>
