If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time who still questions the power of our democracy , tonight is your answer . It is the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen by people who waited three hours and four hours , many for the very first time in their lives , because they believed that this time must be different that their voice could be that difference . It is the answer spoken by young and old , rich and poor , Democrat and Republican , black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American , gay , straight , disabled and not disabled Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States we are , and always will be , the United States of America . It is the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical , and fearful , and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day . It is been a long time coming , but tonight , because of what we did on this day , in this election , at this defining moment , change has come to America . I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain . He fought long and hard in this campaign , and he is fought even longer and harder for the country he loves . He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine , and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader . I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved , and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation s promise in the months ahead . I want to thank my partner in this journey , a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware , the Vice President elect of the United States , Joe Biden . I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years , the rock of our family and the love of my life , our nation s next First Lady , Michelle Obama . Sasha and Malia , I love you both so much , and you have earned the new puppy that is coming with us to the White House . And while she is no longer with us , I know my grandmother is watching , along with the family that made me who I am . I miss them tonight , and know that my debt to them is beyond measure . To my campaign manager David Plouffe , my chief strategist David Axelrod , and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen , and I am forever grateful for what you have sacrificed to get it done . But above all , I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to it belongs to you . I was never the likeliest candidate for this office . We did not start with much money or many endorsements . Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston . It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause . It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation s apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep from the not so young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers from the millions of Americans who volunteered , and organized , and proved that more than two centuries later , a government of the people , by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth . This is your victory . I know you did not do this just to win an election and I know you did not do it for me . You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead . For even as we celebrate tonight , we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime two wars , a planet in peril , the worst financial crisis in a century . Even as we stand here tonight , we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us . There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they will make the mortgage , or pay their doctor s bills , or save enough for college . There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair . The road ahead will be long . Our climb will be steep . We may not get there in one year or even one term , but America I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there . I promise you we as a people will get there . There will be setbacks and false starts . There are many who will not agree with every decision or policy I make as President , and we know that government cannot solve every problem . But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face . I will listen to you , especially when we disagree . And above all , I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it is been done in America for two hundred and twenty one years block by block , brick by brick , calloused hand by calloused hand . What began twenty one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night . This victory alone is not the change we seek it is only the chance for us to make that change . And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were . It cannot happen without you . So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves , but each other . Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything , it is that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers in this country , we rise or fall as one nation as one people . Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long . Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House a party founded on the values of self reliance , individual liberty , and national unity . Those are values we all share , and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight , we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress . As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours , We are not enemies , but friends . . . though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection . And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn I may not have won your vote , but I hear your voices , I need your help , and I will be your President too . And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores , from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world our stories are singular , but our destiny is shared , and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand . To those who would tear this world down we will defeat you . To those who seek peace and security we support you . And to all those who have wondered if America s beacon still burns as bright tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth , but from the enduring power of our ideals democracy , liberty , opportunity , and unyielding hope . For that is the true genius of America that America can change . Our union can be perfected . And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow . This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations . But one that is on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta . She is a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old . She was born just a generation past slavery a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky when someone like her could not vote for two reasons because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin . And tonight , I think about all that she is seen throughout her century in America the heartache and the hope the struggle and the progress the times we were told that we cannot , and the people who pressed on with that American creed Yes we can . At a time when women s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed , she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot . Yes we can . When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land , she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal , new jobs and a new sense of common purpose . Yes we can . When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world , she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved . Yes we can . She was there for the buses in Montgomery , the hoses in Birmingham , a bridge in Selma , and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that We Shall Overcome . Yes we can . A man touched down on the moon , a wall came down in Berlin , a world was connected by our own science and imagination . And this year , in this election , she touched her finger to a screen , and cast her vote , because after 106 years in America , through the best of times and the darkest of hours , she knows how America can change . Yes we can . America , we have come so far . We have seen so much . But there is so much more to do . So tonight , let us ask ourselves if our children should live to see the next century if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper , what change will they see What progress will we have made This is our chance to answer that call . This is our moment . This is our time to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many , we are one that while we breathe , we hope , and where we are met with cynicism , and doubt , and those who tell us that we cannot , we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people Yes We Can . Thank you , God bless you , and may God Bless the United States of America .I stand here today humbled by the task before us , grateful for the trust you have bestowed , mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors . I thank President Bush for his service to our nation , as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition . Forty four Americans have now taken the presidential oath . The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace . Yet , every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms . At these moments , America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office , but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers , and true to our founding documents . So it has been . So it must be with this generation of Americans . That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood . Our nation is at war , against a far reaching network of violence and hatred . Our economy is badly weakened , a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some , but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age . Homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered . Our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet . These are the indicators of crisis , subject to data and statistics . Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land a nagging fear that America s decline is inevitable , and that the next generation must lower its sights . Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real . They are serious and they are many . They will not be met easily or in a short span of time . But know this , America they will be met . On this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord . On this day , we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn out dogmas , that for far too long have strangled our politics . We remain a young nation , but in the words of Scripture , the time has come to set aside childish things . The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift , that noble idea , passed on from generation to generation the God given promise that all are equal , all are free , and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness . In reaffirming the greatness of our nation , we understand that greatness is never a given . It must be earned . Our journey has never been one of short cuts or settling for less . It has not been the path for the faint hearted for those who prefer leisure over work , or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame . Rather , it has been the risk takers , the doers , the makers of things some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom . For us , they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life . For us , they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth . For us , they fought and died , in places like Concord and Gettysburg Normandy and Khe Sahn . Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life . They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction . This is the journey we continue today . We remain the most prosperous , powerful nation on Earth . Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began . Our minds are no less inventive , our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year . Our capacity remains undiminished . But our time of standing pat , of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions that time has surely passed . Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America . For everywhere we look , there is work to be done . The state of the economy calls for action , bold and swift , and we will act not only to create new jobs , but to lay a new foundation for growth . We will build the roads and bridges , the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together . We will restore science to its rightful place , and wield technology s wonders to raise health care s quality and lower its cost . We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories . And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age . All this we can do . And all this we will do . Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans . Their memories are short . For they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose , and necessity to courage . What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply . The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small , but whether it works whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage , care they can afford , a retirement that is dignified . Where the answer is yes , we intend to move forward . Where the answer is no , programs will end . And those of us who manage the public s dollars will be held to account to spend wisely , reform bad habits , and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government . Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill . Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched , but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye , the market can spin out of control and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous . The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product , but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity , but because it is the surest route to our common good . As for our common defense , we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . Our Founding Fathers , faced with perils we can scarcely imagine , drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man , a charter expanded by the blood of generations . Those ideals still light the world , and we will not give them up for expedience s sake . And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today , from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that America is a friend of each nation and every man , woman , and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity , and that we are ready to lead once more . Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks , but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions . They understood that our power alone cannot protect us , nor does it entitle us to do as we please . Instead , they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause , the force of our example , the tempering qualities of humility and restraint . We are the keepers of this legacy . Guided by these principles once more , we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort even greater cooperation and understanding between nations . We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people , and forge a hard earned peace in Afghanistan . With old friends and former foes , we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat , and roll back the specter of a warming planet . We will not apologize for our way of life , nor will we waver in its defense , and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents , we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us , and we will defeat you . For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength , not a weakness . We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus and non believers . We are shaped by every language and culture , drawn from every end of this Earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation , and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united , we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller , our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace . To the Muslim world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict , or blame their society s ills on the West , know that your people will judge you on what you can build , not what you destroy . To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent , know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . To the people of poor nations , we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds . And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty , we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world s resources without regard to effect . For the world has changed , and we must change with it . As we consider the road that unfolds before us , we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who , at this very hour , patrol far off deserts and distant mountains . They have something to tell us today , just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages . We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty , but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves . And yet , at this moment a moment that will define a generation it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all . For as much as government can do and must do , it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies . It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break , the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours . It is the firefighter s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke , but also a parent s willingness to nurture a child , that finally decides our fate . Our challenges may be new . The instruments with which we meet them may be new . But those values upon which our success depends hard work and honesty , courage and fair play , tolerance and curiosity , loyalty and patriotism these things are old . These things are true . They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history . What is demanded then is a return to these truths . What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition , on the part of every American , that we have duties to ourselves , our nation , and the world , duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly , firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit , so defining of our character , than giving our all to a difficult task . This is the price and the promise of citizenship . This is the source of our confidence the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny . This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall , and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath . So let us mark this day with remembrance , of who we are and how far we have traveled . In the year of America s birth , in the coldest of months , a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river . The capital was abandoned . The enemy was advancing . The snow was stained with blood . At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt , the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people Let it be told to the future world . . . that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive . . . that the city and the country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet . America . In the face of our common dangers , in this winter of our hardship , let us remember these timeless words . With hope and virtue , let us brave once more the icy currents , and endure what storms may come . Let it be said by our children s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end , that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God s grace upon us , we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations . Thank you . God bless you . And may God bless the United States of America .To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation With profound gratitude and great humility , I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States . Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours Hillary Rodham Clinton . To President Clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it to Ted Kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service and to the next Vice President of the United States , Joe Biden , I thank you . I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night . To the love of my life , our next First Lady , Michelle Obama , and to Sasha and Malia I love you so much , and I am so proud of all of you . Four years ago , I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who were not well off or well known , but shared a belief that in America , their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to . It is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well . That is why I stand here tonight . Because for two hundred and thirty two years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive . We meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the American promise has been threatened once more . Tonight , more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less . More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet . More of you have cars you cannot afford to drive , credit card bills you cannot afford to pay , and tuition that is beyond your reach . These challenges are not all of government s making . But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George Bush . America , we are better than these last eight years . We are a better country than this . This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work . This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he is worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news . We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes . Tonight , I say to the American people , to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land enough This moment this election is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the American promise alive . Because next week , in Minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third . And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight . On November 4th , we must stand up and say Eight is enough . Now let there be no doubt . The Republican nominee , John McCain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect . And next week , we will also hear about those occasions when he is broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need . But the record s clear John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time . Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment , but really , what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time I do not know about you , but I am not ready to take a ten percent chance on change . The truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy Senator McCain has been anything but independent . He said that our economy has made great progress under this President . He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong . And when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession , and that we have become , and I quote , a nation of whiners . A nation of whiners Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made . Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty . These are not whiners . They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint . These are the Americans that I know . Now , I do not believe that Senator McCain does not care what is going on in the lives of Americans . I just think he does not know . Why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people s benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement It is not because John McCain does not care . It is because John McCain does not get it . For over two decades , he is subscribed to that old , discredited Republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else . In Washington , they call this the Ownership Society , but what it really means is you are on your own . Out of work Tough luck . No health care The market will fix it . Born into poverty Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you do not have boots . You are on your own . Well it is time for them to own their failure . It is time for us to change America . You see , we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country . We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma . We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President when the average American family saw its income go up 7 , 500 instead of down 2 , 000 like it has under George Bush . We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work . The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight . Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan , I see my grandfather , who signed up after Pearl Harbor , marched in Patton s Army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill . In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , I think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships . When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed . And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , I think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman . She is the one who taught me about hard work . She is the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life . She poured everything she had into me . And although she can no longer travel , I know that she is watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well . I do not know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine . These are my heroes . Theirs are the stories that shaped me . And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States . What is that promise It is a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect . It is a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs , look out for American workers , and play by the rules of the road . Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology . Our government should work for us , not against us . It should help us , not hurt us . It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every American who is willing to work . That is the promise of America the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that I am my brother s keeper I am my sister s keeper . That is the promise we need to keep . That is the change we need right now . So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President . Change means a tax code that does not reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it . Unlike John McCain , I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America . I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage , high tech jobs of tomorrow . I will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families . Because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class . And for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , I will set a clear goal as President in ten years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East . Washington s been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years , and John McCain has been there for twenty six of them . In that time , he is said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels . And today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office . Now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure , not a long term solution . Not even close . As President , I will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power . I will help our auto companies re tool , so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in America . I will make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars . And I will invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cannot ever be outsourced . America , now is not the time for small plans . Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy . Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education . And I will not settle for an America where some kids do not have that chance . I will invest in early childhood education . I will recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support . And in exchange , I will ask for higher standards and more accountability . And we will keep our promise to every young American if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education . Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single American . If you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums . If you do not , you will be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves . And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most . Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent . Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses and the time to protect Social Security for future generations . And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day s work , because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons . Now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why I have laid out how I will pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do not help America grow . But I will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy . And Democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling America s promise will require more than just money . It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John Kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength . Yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient . Yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair . But we must also admit that programs alone cannot replace parents that government cannot turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need . Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that is the essence of America s promise . And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep America s promise abroad . If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next Commander in Chief , that is a debate I am ready to have . For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9 11 , I stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face . When John McCain said we could just muddle through in Afghanistan , I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 , and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights . John McCain likes to say that he will follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell but he will not even go to the cave where he lives . And today , as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration , even after we learned that Iraq has a 79 billion surplus while we are wallowing in deficits , John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war . That is not the judgment we need . That will not keep America safe . We need a President who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past . You do not defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq . You do not protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington . You cannot truly stand up for Georgia when you have strained our oldest alliances . If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice but it is not the change we need . We are the party of Roosevelt . We are the party of Kennedy . So do not tell me that Democrats will not defend this country . Do not tell me that Democrats will not keep us safe . The Bush McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans Democrats and Republicans have built , and we are here to restore that legacy . As Commander in Chief , I will never hesitate to defend this nation , but I will only send our troops into harm s way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home . I will end this war in Iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan . I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts . But I will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression . I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease . And I will restore our moral standing , so that America is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future . These are the policies I will pursue . And in the weeks ahead , I look forward to debating them with John McCain . But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes . Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other s character and patriotism . The times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook . So let us agree that patriotism has no party . I love this country , and so do you , and so does John McCain . The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag . They have not served a Red America or a Blue America they have served the United States of America . So I have got news for you , John McCain . We all put our country first . America , our work will not be easy . The challenges we face require tough choices , and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past . For part of what has been lost these past eight years cannot just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits . What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose . And that is what we have to restore . We may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country . The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland , but do not tell me we cannot uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK 47s out of the hands of criminals . I know there are differences on same sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination . Passions fly on immigration , but I do not know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers . This too is part of America s promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort . I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk . They claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values . And that is to be expected . Because if you do not have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters . If you do not have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from . You make a big election about small things . And you know what it is worked before . Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government . When Washington does not work , all its promises seem empty . If your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it is best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know . I get it . I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office . I do not fit the typical pedigree , and I have not spent my career in the halls of Washington . But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring . What the nay sayers do not understand is that this election has never been about me . It is been about you . For eighteen long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past . You understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result . You have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does not come from Washington . Change comes to Washington . Change happens because the American people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time . America , this is one of those moments . I believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming . Because I have seen it . Because I have lived it . I have seen it in Illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work . I have seen it in Washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands . And I have seen it in this campaign . In the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time . In the Republicans who never thought they had pick up a Democratic ballot , but did . I have seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise . This country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that is not what makes us rich . We have the most powerful military on Earth , but that is not what makes us strong . Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that is not what keeps the world coming to our shores . Instead , it is that American spirit that American promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend . That promise is our greatest inheritance . It is a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot . And it is that promise that forty five years ago today , brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington , before Lincoln s Memorial , and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream . The men and women who gathered there could have heard many things . They could have heard words of anger and discord . They could have been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred . But what the people heard instead people of every creed and color , from every walk of life is that in America , our destiny is inextricably linked . That together , our dreams can be one . We cannot walk alone , the preacher cried . And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead . We cannot turn back . America , we cannot turn back . Not with so much work to be done . Not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for . Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save . Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend . America , we cannot turn back . We cannot walk alone . At this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future . Let us keep that promise that American promise and in the words of Scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess . Thank you , God Bless you , and God Bless the United States of America .It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act we are upholding one of this nation s first principles that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness . It is also fitting that we are joined today by the woman after whom this bill is named someone Michelle and I have had the privilege of getting to know for ourselves . Lilly Ledbetter did not set out to be a trailblazer or a household name . She was just a good hard worker who did her job and did it well for nearly two decades before discovering that for years , she was paid less than her male colleagues for the very same work . Over the course of her career , she lost more than 200 , 000 in salary , and even more in pension and Social Security benefits losses she still feels today . Now , Lilly could have accepted her lot and moved on . She could have decided that it was not worth the hassle and harassment that would inevitably come with speaking up for what she deserved . But instead , she decided that there was a principle at stake , something worth fighting for . So she set out on a journey that would take more than ten years , take her all the way to the Supreme Court , and lead to this bill which will help others get the justice she was denied . Because while this bill bears her name , Lilly knows this story is not just about her . It is the story of women across this country still earning just 78 cents for every dollar men earn women of color even less which means that today , in the year 2009 , countless women are still losing thousands of dollars in salary , income and retirement savings over the course of a lifetime . But equal pay is by no means just a women s issue it is a family issue . It is about parents who find themselves with less money for tuition or child care couples who wind up with less to retire on households where , when one breadwinner is paid less than she deserves , that is the difference between affording the mortgage or not between keeping the heat on , or paying the doctor s bills or not . And in this economy , when so many folks are already working harder for less and struggling to get by , the last thing they can afford is losing part of each month s paycheck to simple discrimination . So in signing this bill today , I intend to send a clear message That making our economy work means making sure it works for everyone . That there are no second class citizens in our workplaces , and that it is not just unfair and illegal but bad for business to pay someone less because of their gender , age , race , ethnicity , religion or disability . And that justice is not about some abstract legal theory , or footnote in a casebook it is about how our laws affect the daily realities of people s lives their ability to make a living and care for their families and achieve their goals . Ultimately , though , equal pay is not just an economic issue for millions of Americans and their families , it is a question of who we are and whether we are truly living up to our fundamental ideals . Whether we will do our part , as generations before us , to ensure those words put to paper more than 200 years ago really mean something to breathe new life into them with the more enlightened understandings of our time . That is what Lilly Ledbetter challenged us to do . And today , I sign this bill not just in her honor , but in honor of those who came before her . Women like my grandmother who worked in a bank all her life , and even after she hit that glass ceiling , kept getting up and giving her best every day , without complaint , because she wanted something better for me and my sister . And I sign this bill for my daughters , and all those who will come after us , because I want them to grow up in a nation that values their contributions , where there are no limits to their dreams and they have opportunities their mothers and grandmothers never could have imagined . In the end , that is why Lilly stayed the course . She knew it was too late for her that this bill would not undo the years of injustice she faced or restore the earnings she was denied . But this grandmother from Alabama kept on fighting , because she was thinking about the next generation . It is what we have always done in America set our sights high for ourselves , but even higher for our children and grandchildren . Now it is up to us to continue this work . This bill is an important step a simple fix to ensure fundamental fairness to American workers and I want to thank this remarkable and bi partisan group of legislators who worked so hard to get it passed . And this is only the beginning . I know that if we stay focused , as Lilly did and keep standing for what is right , as Lilly did we will close that pay gap and ensure that our daughters have the same rights , the same chances , and the same freedom to pursue their dreams as our sons . Thank you .Thank you , everybody . Please have a seat . You guys can sit down , too . Let me begin by saying thank you to a few people first of all , your outstanding Governor , Bill Ritter . Please give Bill a big round of applause . Lieutenant Governor Barbara O Brien . Secretary of State Bernie Buescher . Your outstanding Mayor , John Hickenlooper . Your new Senator , Michael Bennett . Your old senator , now my Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar . Mark Udall is not here , but give him a round of applause anyway . One of the outstanding leaders who helped shepherd this process through in record time please give Max Baucus of Montana a big round of applause . Thank you , Max . To Secretary Federico Pena , one of my national co chairs I would not be here if it were not for Federico . Thank you . To Representative Diana DeGette , who is a we are in her district . So , thank you so much . Representative Betsy Markey . Representative Jared Polis . Representative Ed Perlmutter . To all the other elected officials and outstanding leaders who are here . And to the whole Namaste family and Mr . Jones for outstanding work , congratulations . Give them a big round of applause . And to the best Vice President that we have had in a long time Joe Biden . It is great to be back in Denver . I was here last summer we had a good time to accept the nomination of my party and to make a promise to people of all parties that I would do all that I could to give every American the chance to make of their lives what they will to see their children climb higher than they did . And I am back today to say that we have begun the difficult work of keeping that promise . We have begun the essential work of keeping the American Dream alive in our time . And that is why we are here today . Now , I do not want to pretend that today marks the end of our economic problems . Nor does it constitute all of what we are going to have to do to turn our economy around . But today does mark the beginning of the end the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs the beginning of what we need to do to provide relief for families worried they will not be able to pay next month s bills the beginning of the first steps to set our economy on a firmer foundation , paving the way to long term growth and prosperity . The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that I will sign today a plan that meets the principles I laid out in January is the most sweeping economic recovery package in our history . It is the product of broad consultation and the recipient of broad support from business leaders , unions , public interest groups , from the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers , as well as the AFL CI From Democrats and Republicans , mayors as well as governors . It is a rare thing in Washington for people with such diverse and different viewpoints to come together and support the same bill . And on behalf of our nation , I want to thank all of them for it , including your two outstanding Senators , Michael Bennett and Mark Udall , as well as all the members of your congressional delegation . They did an outstanding job and they deserve a big round of applause . I also want to thank Joe Biden for working behind the scenes from the very start to make this recovery act possible . I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Harry Reid for acting so quickly and for proving that Congress could step up to this challenge . I have special thanks to Max Baucus , who is the Chairman of the Finance Committee . Without Max , none of this would have happened . He had to work overtime , and push his committee to work overtime . And I want to thank all the committee chairs and members of Congress for coming up with a plan that is both bold and balanced enough to meet the demands of this moment . The American people were looking to them for leadership , and that is what they provided . Now , what makes this recovery plan so important is not just that it will create or save 3 . 5 million jobs over the next two years , including 60 , 000 plus here in Colorado . It is that we are putting Americans to work doing the work that America needs done in critical areas that have been neglected for too long work that will bring real and lasting change for generations to come . Because we know we cannot build our economic future on the transportation and information networks of the past , we are remaking the American landscape with the largest new investment in our nation s infrastructure since Eisenhower built an Interstate Highway System in the 1950s . Because of this investment , nearly 400 , 000 men and women will go to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges , repairing our faulty dams and levees , bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America , upgrading mass transit , building high speed rail lines that will improve travel and commerce throughout our nation . Because we know America cannot out compete the world tomorrow if our children are being out educated today , we are making the largest investment in education in our nation s history . It is an investment that will create jobs building 21st century classrooms and libraries and labs for millions of children across America . It will provide funds to train a new generation of math and science teachers , while giving aid to states and school districts to stop teachers from being laid off and education programs from being cut . In a place like New York City , 14 , 000 teachers who were set to be let go may now be able to continue pursuing their critical mission . It is an investment that will create a new 2 , 500 annual tax credit to put the dream of a college degree within reach for middle class families and make college affordable for 7 million students helping more of our sons and daughters aim higher , reach further , fulfill their God given potential . Because we know that spiraling health care costs are crushing families and businesses alike , we are taking the most meaningful steps in years towards modernizing our health care system . It is an investment that will take the long overdue step of computerizing America s medical records to reduce the duplication and waste that costs billions of health care dollars , and medical errors that cost thousands of lives each year . Further , thanks to the actions we have taken , 7 million Americans who lost their health care along the way will continue to get the coverage they need , and roughly 20 million more Americans can breathe a little easier knowing that their health care will not be cut due to a state budget shortfall . And a historic commitment to wellness initiatives will keep millions of Americans from setting foot in the doctor s office in the first place because these are preventable diseases and we are going to invest in prevention . So taken together with the enactment earlier this month of a long delayed law to extend health care to millions more children of working families we have done more in 30 days to advance the cause of health care reform than this country has done in an entire decade . And that is something we should be proud of . Because we know we cannot power America s future on energy that is controlled by foreign dictators , we are taking big steps down the road to energy independence , laying the groundwork for new green energy economies that can create countless well paying jobs . It is an investment that will double the amount of renewable energy produced over the next three years . Think about that double the amount of renewable energy in three years . Provide tax credits and loan guarantees to companies like Namaste , a company that will be expanding , instead of laying people off , as a result of the plan that I am about to sign . And in the process , we will transform the way we use energy . Today , the electricity we use is carried along a grid of lines and wires that date back to Thomas Edison a grid that cannot support the demands of this economy . This means we are using 19th and 20th century technologies to battle 21st century problems like climate change and energy security . It also means that places like North Dakota can that can produce a lot of wind energy cannot deliver it to communities that want it , leading to a gap between how much clean energy we are using and how much we could be using . The investment we are making today will create a newer , smarter electric grid that will allow for broader use of alternative energy . We will build on the work that is being done in places like Boulder a community that is on its that is on pace to be the world s first Smart Grid city . This investment will place Smart Meters in homes to make our energy bills lower , make outages less likely , and make it easier to use clean energy . It is an investment that will save taxpayers over 1 billion by slashing energy costs in our federal buildings by 25 percent save working families hundreds of dollars a year on their energy bills by weatherizing over 1 million homes . And it is an investment that takes the important first step towards a national transmission superhighway that will connect our cities to the windy plains of the Dakotas and the sunny deserts of the Southwest . Even beyond energy , from the National Institutes of Health to the National Science Foundation , this recovery act represents the biggest increase in basic research funding in the long history of America s noble endeavor to better understand our world . And just as President Kennedy sparked an explosion of innovation when he set America s sights on the moon , I hope this investment will ignite our imagination once more , spurring new discoveries and breakthroughs in science , in medicine , in energy , to make our economy stronger and our nation more secure and our planet safer for our children . Now , while this package is composed mostly of critical investments , it also includes aid to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of firefighters or police recruits in recruits like the ones in Columbus , Ohio , who were told that instead of being sworn in as officers , they were about to be let go . It includes help for those hardest hit by our economic crisis like the nearly 18 million Americans who will get larger unemployment checks in the mail . About a third of this package comes in the forms of tax cuts by the way , the most progressive in our history not only spurring job creation , but putting money in the pockets of 95 percent of hardworking families in America . So unlike the tax cuts that we have seen in recent years , the vast majority of these tax benefits will go not to the wealthiest Americans , but to the middle class with those workers who make the least benefiting the most . And it is a plan that rewards responsibility , lifting two million Americans from poverty by ensuring that anyone who works hard does not have to raise a child below the poverty line . So as a whole , this plan will help poor and working Americans pull themselves into the middle class in a way we have not seen in nearly 50 years . What I am signing , then , is a balanced plan with a mix of tax cuts and investments . It is a plan that is been put together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending . It is a plan that will be implemented with an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability . With a recovery package of this size comes a responsibility to assure every taxpayer that we are being careful with the money they work so hard to earn . And that is why I am assigning a team of managers to ensure that the precious dollars we have invested are being spent wisely and well . We will Governor Ritter , Mayor Hickenlooper , we are going to hold governors and local officials who receive the money to the same high standard . And we expect you , the American people , to hold us accountable for the results . And that is why we have created Recovery . gov a web site so that every American can go online and see how this money is being spent and what kind of job is being created , where those jobs are being created . We want transparency and accountability throughout this process . Now , as important as the step we take today is , this legislation represents only the first part of the broad strategy we need to address our economic crisis . In the coming days and weeks , I will be launching other aspects of the plan . We will need to stabilize , repair , and reform our banking system , and get credit flowing again to families and businesses . We will need to end the culture where we ignore problems until they become full blown crises instead of recognizing that the only way to build a thriving economy is to set and enforce firm rules of the road . We must stem the spread of foreclosures and falling home values for all Americans , and do everything we can to help responsible homeowners stay in their homes something I will talk more about tomorrow . And we will need to do everything in the short term to get our economy moving again , while at the same time recognizing that we have inherited a trillion dollar deficit , and we need to begin restoring fiscal discipline and taming our exploding deficits over the long term . None of this will be easy . The road to recovery will not be straight . We will make progress and there may be some slippage along the way . It will demand courage and discipline . It will demand a new sense of responsibility that is been missing from Wall Street all the way to Washington . There will be hazards and reverses . But I have every confidence that if we are willing to continue doing the critical work that must be done by each of us , by all of us then we will leave this struggling economy behind us , and come out on the other side , more prosperous as a people . For our American story is not and has never been about things coming easy . It is about rising to the moment when the moment is hard , and converting crisis into opportunity , and seeing to it that we emerge from whatever trials we face stronger than we were before . It is about rejecting the notion that our fate is somehow written for us , and instead laying claim to a destiny of our own making . That is what earlier generations of Americans have done , that is what we owe our children , that is what we are doing today . Thank you , Colorado . Let us get to work . Thank you .Thank you , everybody . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you , everybody . Please have a seat . Thank you . I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for their extraordinary leadership . I want to recognize Dr . Buzz Aldrin as well , who is in the house . Four decades ago , Buzz became a legend . But in the four decades since he is also been one of America s leading visionaries and authorities on human space flight . Few people present company excluded can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill and Charlie when it comes to space exploration . I have to say that few people are as singularly unimpressed by Air Force One as those three . Sure , it is comfortable , but it cannot even reach low Earth orbit . And that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just saw on the launch pad , which will be tested for the very first time in the coming weeks . A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make . We have got Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from Texas visiting us , a big supporter of the space program . My director , Office of Science and Technology Policy in other words my chief science advisor John Holdren is here . And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman Suzanne Kosmas , because every time I meet with her , including the flight down here , she reminds me of how important our NASA programs are and how important this facility is . And she is fighting for every single one of you and for her district and for the jobs in her district . And you should know that you have got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas . Please give her a big round of applause . I also want to thank everybody for participating in today s conference . And gathered here are scientists , engineers , business leaders , public servants , and a few more astronauts as well . Last but not least , I want to thank the men and women of NASA for welcoming me to the Kennedy Space Center , and for your contributions not only to America , but to the world . Here at the Kennedy Space Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of those contributions . It was from here that NASA launched the missions of Mercury and Gemini and Apollo . It was from here that Space Shuttle Discovery , piloted by Charlie Bolden , carried the Hubble Telescope into orbit , allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy . And I should point out , by the way , that in my private office just off the Oval , I have got the picture of Jupiter from the Hubble . So thank you , Charlie , for helping to decorate my office . It was from here that men and women , propelled by sheer nerve and talent , set about pushing the boundaries of humanity s reach . That is the story of NASAnd it is a story that started a little more than half a century ago , far from the Space Coast , in a remote and desolate region of what is now called Kazakhstan . Because it was from there that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik , the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth , which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and a battery strapped to the top of a missile . But the world was stunned . Americans were dumbfounded . The Soviets , it was perceived , had taken the lead in a race for which we were not yet fully prepared . But we caught up very quick . President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and to invest in science and math education , from grade school to graduate school . In 1961 , President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth within the decade . And as a nation , we set about meeting that goal , reaping rewards that have in the decades since touched every facet of our lives . NASA was at the forefront . Many gave their careers to the effort . And some have given far more . In the years that have followed , the space race inspired a generation of scientists and innovators , including , I am sure , many of you . It is contributed to immeasurable technological advances that have improved our health and well being , from satellite navigation to water purification , from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging . Although , I have to say , during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said , you know , it is more than just Tang and I had to point out I actually really like Tang . I thought that was very cool . And leading the world to space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here on Earth , while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of its people . And on a personal note , I have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program . 1961 was the year of my birth the year that Kennedy made his announcement . And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather s shoulders , waving a flag as astronauts arrived in Hawaii . For me , the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an American reaching for new heights , stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible . And so , as President , I believe that space exploration is not a luxury , it is not an afterthought in America s quest for a brighter future it is an essential part of that quest . So today , I had like to talk about the next chapter in this story . The challenges facing our space program are different , and our imperatives for this program are different , than in decades past . We are no longer racing against an adversary . We are no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like reaching the Moon . In fact , what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration . But while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years , what we do or fail to do in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth . So let me start by being extremely clear I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future . Because broadening our capabilities in space will continue to serve our society in ways that we can scarcely imagine . Because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation sparking passions and launching careers . And because , ultimately , if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery , we are ceding our future and we are ceding that essential element of the American character . I know there have been a number of questions raised about my administration s plan for space exploration , especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on NASA as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community . And these questions come at a time of transition , as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service . And understandably , this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about their own futures but about the future of the space program to which they have devoted their lives . But I also know that underlying these concerns is a deeper worry , one that precedes not only this plan but this administration . It stems from the sense that people in Washington driven sometimes less by vision than by politics have for years neglected NASA s mission and undermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it . We have seen that in the NASA budget , which has risen and fallen with the political winds . But we can also see it in other ways in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear , achievable objectives to provide the resources to meet those objectives and to justify not just these plans but the larger purpose of space exploration in the 21st century . All that has to change . And with the strategy I am outlining today , it will . We start by increasing NASA s budget by 6 billion over the next five years , even I want people to understand the context of this . This is happening even as we have instituted a freeze on discretionary spending and sought to make cuts elsewhere in the budget . So NASfrom the start , several months ago when I issued my budget , was one of the areas where we did not just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by 6 billion . By doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system , including a probe of the Sun s atmosphere new scouting missions to Mars and other destinations and an advanced telescope to follow Hubble , allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before . We will increase Earth based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world science that will garner tangible benefits , helping us to protect our environment for future generations . And we will extend the life of the International Space Station likely by more than five years , while actually using it for its intended purpose conducting advanced research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on Earth , as well as testing and improving upon our capabilities in space . This includes technologies like more efficient life support systems that will help reduce the cost of future missions . And in order to reach the space station , we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable . Now , I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way . I disagree . The truth is , NASA has always relied on private industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space , from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago , to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead . By buying the services of space transportation rather than the vehicles themselves we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met . But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations as companies from young startups to established leaders compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere . In addition , as part of this effort , we will build on the good work already done on the Orion crew capsule . I have directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a rescue vehicle using this technology , so we are not forced to rely on foreign providers if it becomes necessary to quickly bring our people home from the International Space Station . And this Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions . In fact , Orion will be readied for flight right here in this room . Next , we will invest more than 3 billion to conduct research on an advanced heavy lift rocket a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsules , propulsion systems , and large quantities of supplies needed to reach deep space . In developing this new vehicle , we will not only look at revising or modifying older models we want to look at new designs , new materials , new technologies that will transform not just where we can go but what we can do when we get there . And we will finalize a rocket design no later than 2015 and then begin to build it . And I want everybody to understand That is at least two years earlier than previously planned and that is conservative , given that the previous program was behind schedule and over budget . At the same time , after decades of neglect , we will increase investment right away in other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and more often , to travel farther and faster for less cost , and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely . That means tackling major scientific and technological challenges . How do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions How do we harness resources on distant worlds How do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these far reaching journeys These are questions that we can answer and will answer . And these are the questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth . So the point is what we are looking for is not just to continue on the same path we want to leap into the future we want major breakthroughs a transformative agenda for NAS Now , yes , pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy . In part , this is because the old strategy including the Constellation program was not fulfilling its promise in many ways . That is not just my assessment that is also the assessment of a panel of respected non partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely . Now , despite this , some have had harsh words for the decisions we have made , including some individuals who I have got enormous respect and admiration for . But what I hope is , is that everybody will take a look at what we are planning , consider the details of what we have laid out , and see the merits as I have described them . The bottom line is nobody is more committed to manned space flight , to human exploration of space than I am . But we have got to do it in a smart way , and we cannot just keep on doing the same old things that we have been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where we want to go . Some have said , for instance , that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to produce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit , instead of relying on companies and other countries . But we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan , in ways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs , which are both essential for the long term sustainability of space flight . In fact , through our plan , we will be sending many more astronauts to space over the next decade . There are also those who criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that will hinder space exploration below low Earth orbit . But it is precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities even as we build on the important work already completed , through projects like Orion , for future missions . And unlike the previous program , we are setting a course with specific and achievable milestones . Early in the next decade , a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit . And by 2025 , we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space . So we will start we will start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history . By the mid 2030s , I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth . And a landing on Mars will follow . And I expect to be around to see it . But I want to repeat I want to repeat this Critical to deep space exploration will be the development of breakthrough propulsion systems and other advanced technologies . So I am challenging NASA to break through these barriers . And we will give you the resources to break through these barriers . And I know you will , with ingenuity and intensity , because that is what you have always done . Now , I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the Moon first , as previously planned . But I just have to say pretty bluntly here We have been there before . Buzz has been there . There is a lot more of space to explore , and a lot more to learn when we do . So I believe it is more important to ramp up our capabilities to reach and operate at a series of increasingly demanding targets , while advancing our technological capabilities with each step forward . And that is what this strategy does . And that is how we will ensure that our leadership in space is even stronger in this new century than it was in the last . Finally , I want to say a few words about jobs . Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time I was here , I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who are already going through a tough time here in this region were helped . And despite some reports to the contrary , my plan will add more than 2 , 500 jobs along the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previous administration . So I want to make that point . We are going to modernize the Kennedy Space Center , creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities . And there is potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and across America compete to be part of a new space transportation industry . And some of those industry leaders are here today . This holds the promise of generating more than 10 , 000 jobs nationwide over the next few years . And many of these jobs will be created right here in Florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition . Now , it is true there are Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program winds down . This is based on a decision that was made six years ago , not six months ago , but that does not make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality . So I am proposing in part because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne , as well as Charlie I am proposing a 40 million initiative led by a high level team from the White House , NASand other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation . And I expect this plan to reach my desk by August 15th . It is an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond . So this is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASWe will partner with industry . We will invest in cutting edge research and technology . We will set far reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones . And step by step , we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do . Fifty years after the creation of NASour goal is no longer just a destination to reach . Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time , ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite . And in fulfilling this task , we will not only extend humanity s reach in space we will strengthen America s leadership here on Earth . Now , I will close by saying this . I know that some Americans have asked a question that is particularly apt on Tax Day Why spend money on NASA at all Why spend money solving problems in space when we do not lack for problems to solve here on the ground And obviously our country is still reeling from the worst economic turmoil we have known in generations . We have massive structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years . But you and I know this is a false choice . We have to fix our economy . We need to close our deficits . But for pennies on the dollar , the space program has fueled jobs and entire industries . For pennies on the dollar , the space program has improved our lives , advanced our society , strengthened our economy , and inspired generations of Americans . And I have no doubt that NASA can continue to fulfill this role . But that is why but I want to say clearly to those of you who work for NASbut to the entire community that has been so supportive of the space program in this area That is exactly why it is so essential that we pursue a new course and that we revitalize NASA and its mission not just with dollars , but with clear aims and a larger purpose . Now , little more than 40 years ago , astronauts descended the nine rung ladder of the lunar module called Eagle , and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earth s only Moon . This was the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit of an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of our knowledge , of our technological prowess , of our very capacity as human beings to solve problems . It was not just the greatest achievement in NASA s history it was one of the greatest achievements in human history . And the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something . I choose to believe it was only the beginning . So thank you . God bless you . And may God bless the United States of America . Thank you .Hello , Ohio It is good to be here in the Buckeye State . Congratulations on winning the Big Ten Championship . I am filling out my brackets now . And it is even better to be out of Washington for a little while . Yes , that kid Turner looks pretty good . You guys are doing all right . It is wonderful to be here I love you back . I do . Couple of people I just want to make sure I give special mention to . First of all , you already saw him , Governor Ted Strickland in the house . Ted is fighting every day to bring jobs and economic development to Ohio . So is your terrific United States Senator Sherrod Brown . Love Sherrod Brown . Your own congressman , who is tireless on behalf of working people , Dennis Kucinich . Did you hear that , Dennis Go ahead , say that again . A couple members of Congress are here Representative Betty Sutton . Representative Marcia Fudge . Representative Tim Ryan . Representative Charlie Wilson . I want to thank Mayor Tom Perciak here in Strongsville . Please , Mr . Mayor , you are on . That is a good bunch of folks we got here in Ohio , working hard . Which is why I am glad to be back and let us face it , it is nice to be out of Washington once in a while . I want to thank Connie I want to thank Connie , who introduced me . I want to thank her and her family for being here on behalf of her sister , Natoma . I do not know if everybody understood that Natoma is in the hospital right now , so Connie was filling in . It is not easy to share such a personal story , when your sister who you love so much is sick . And so I appreciate Connie being willing to do so here today , and and I want everybody to understand that Connie and her sister are the reason that I am here today . See , Connie felt it was important that her sister s story be told . But I want to just repeat what happened here . Last month , I got a letter from Connie s sister , Natoma . She is self employed , she is trying to make ends meet , and for years she is done the responsible thing , just like most of you have . She bought insurance she did not have a big employer who provided her insurance , so she bought her health insurance through the individual market . And it was important for her to have insurance because 16 years ago , she was diagnosed with a treatable form of cancer . And even though she had been cancer free for more than a decade , the insurance companies kept on jacking up her rates , year after year . So she increased her out of pocket expenses . She raised her deductible . She did everything she could to maintain her health insurance that would be there just in case she got sick , because she figured , I did not want to be she did not want to be in a position where , if she did get sick , somebody else would have to pick up the tab that she had have to go to the emergency room that the cost would be shifted onto folks through their higher insurance premiums or hospitals charging higher rates . So she tried to do the right thing . And she upped her deductible last year to the minimum , the highest possible deductible . But despite that , Natoma s insurance company raised her premiums by more than 25 percent . And over the past year , she paid more than 6 , 000 in monthly premiums . She paid more than 4 , 000 in out of pocket medical costs , for co pays and medical care and prescriptions . So all together , this woman paid 10 , 000 one year . But because she never hit her deductible , her insurance company only spent 900 on her care . So the insurance company is making getting 10 , 000 paying out 900 . Now , what comes in the mail at the end of last year It is a letter telling Natoma that her premiums would go up again by more than 40 percent . So here s what happens . She just could not afford it . She did not have the money . She realized that if she paid those health insurance premiums that had been jacked up by 40 percent , she could not make her mortgage . And despite her desire to keep her coverage , despite her fears that she would get sick and lose the home that her parents built she finally surrendered , she finally gave up her health insurance . She stopped paying it she could not make ends meet . So January was her last month of being insured . Like so many responsible Americans folks who work hard every day , who try to do the right thing she was forced to hang her fortunes on chance . To take a chance , that is all she could do . She hoped against hope that she would stay healthy . She feared terribly that she might not stay healthy . That was the letter that I read to the insurance companies , including the person responsible for raising her rates . Now , I understand Natoma was pretty surprised when she found out that I had read it to these CEOs . But I thought it was important for them to understand the human dimensions of this problem . Her rates have been hiked more than 40 percent . And this was less than two weeks ago . Unfortunately , Natoma s worst fears were realized . And just last week , she was working on a nearby farm , walking outside apparently , chasing after a cow when she collapsed . And she was rushed to the hospital . She was very sick . She needed two blood transfusions . Doctors performed a battery of tests . And on Saturday , Natoma was diagnosed with leukemia . Now , the reason Natoma is not here today is that she is lying on a hospital bed , suddenly faced with this emergency suddenly faced with the fight of her life . She expects to face more than a month of aggressive chemotherapy . She is racked with worry not only about her illness but about the costs of the tests and the treatment that she is surely going to need to beat it . So you want to know why I am here , Ohio I am here because of Natoma . I am here because of the countless others who have been forced to face the most terrifying challenges in their lives with the added burden of medical bills they cannot pay . I do not think that is right . Neither do you . That is why we need health insurance right now . Health insurance reform right now . I am here because of my own mother s story . She died of cancer , and in the last six months of her life , she was on the phone in her hospital room arguing with insurance companies instead of focusing on getting well and spending time with her family . I am here because of the millions who are denied coverage because of preexisting conditions or dropped from coverage when they get sick . I am here because of the small businesses who are forced to choose between health care and hiring . I am here because of the seniors unable to afford the prescriptions that they need . I am here because of the folks seeing their premiums go up 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 percent in a year . Ohio , I am here because that is not the America I believe in and that is not the America that you believe in . So when you hear people say start over I want you to think about Natoma . When you hear people saying that this is not the right time , you think about what she is going through . When you hear people talk about , well , what does this mean for the Democrats What does this mean for the Republicans I do not know how the polls are doing . When you hear people more worried about the politics of it than what is right and what is wrong , I want you to think about Natoma and the millions of people all across this country who are looking for some help , and looking for some relief . That is why we need health insurance reform right now . Part of what makes this issue difficult is most of us do have health insurance , we still do . And so and so we kind of feel like , well , I do not know , it is kind of working for me I am not worrying too much . But what we have to understand is that what is happened to Natoma , there but for the grace of God go any one of us . Anybody here , if you lost your job right now and after the COBRA ran out It looks like we have got somebody who might have fainted down there , so if we have got a medic . No , no , no . Hold on . I am talking about there is somebody who might have fainted right down here , so if we can get a medic just back here . They are probably okay . Just give her or him some space . So let us just think about think about if you lost your job right now . How many people here might have had a preexisting condition that would mean it had be very hard to get health insurance on the individual market Think about if you wanted to change jobs . Think about if you wanted to start your own business but you suddenly had to give up your health insurance on your job . Think about what happens if a child of yours , heaven forbid , got diagnosed with something that made it hard for them to insure . For so many people , it may not be a problem right now but it is going to be a problem later , at any point . And even if you have got good health insurance , what is happening to your premiums What is happening to your co payments What is happening to your deductible They are all going up . That is money straight out of your pocket . So the bottom line is this The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable . We cannot have we cannot have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people . And we know what will happen if we fail to act . We know that our government will be plunged deeper into debt . We know that millions more people will lose their coverage . We know that rising costs will saddle millions more families with unaffordable expenses . And a lot of small businesses are just going to drop their coverage altogether . That is already what is been happening . A study came out just yesterday this is a nonpartisan study it is found that without reform , premiums could more than double for individuals and families over the next decade . Family policies could go to an average of 25 , 000 or more . Can you afford that You think your employer can afford that Your employer cannot sustain that . So what is going to happen is , they are basically more and more of them are just going to say , you know what You are on your own on this . We have debated this issue now for more than a year . Every proposal has been put on the table . Every argument has been made . I know a lot of people view this as a partisan issue , but , look , the fact is both parties have a lot of areas where we agree it is just politics are getting in the way of actually getting it done . Somebody asked what is our plan . Let me describe exactly what we are doing , because we have ended up with a proposal that incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans , even though Republicans do not give us any credit . That is all right . You know , if you think about the debate around health care reform , there were some who wanted to scrap the system of private insurance and replace it with government run care . And , look , that works in a number of places , but I did not see that being practical to help right away for people who really need it . And on the other end of the spectrum , and this is what a lot of the Republicans are saying right now , there are those who simply believe that the answer is to unleash the insurance industry , to deregulate them further , provide them less oversight and fewer rules . This is called the fox guarding the henhouse approach to health insurance reform . So what it would do is it would give insurance companies more leeway to raise premiums , more leeway to deny care . It would segment the market further . It would be good if you were rich and healthy . You had save money . But if you are an ordinary person , if you get older , if you get a little sicker , you had be paying more . Now , I do not believe we should give the government or insurance companies more control over health care in America . I believe it is time to give you , the American people , more control over your own health insurance . And that is what our proposal does . Our proposal builds on the current system where most Americans get their health insurance from their employer . So if you like your plan , you can keep your plan . If you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor . I do not want to interfere with people s relationships between them and their doctors . Essentially , here s what my proposal would change three things about the current health care system , but three important things . Number one , it would end the worst practices of the insurance companies . All right This is like a patient s bill of rights on steroids . Within the first year of signing health care reform , thousands of uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time in their lives or the first time since they got sick . This year , insurance companies will be banned forever from denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions . So parents can have a little bit of security . This year , under this legislation , insurance companies will be banned from dropping your coverage when you get sick . Those practices would end . With this reform package , all new insurance plans would be required to offer free preventive care to their customers starting this year so free check ups to catch preventable diseases on the front end . That is a smart thing to do . Starting this year , if you buy a new plan , there will not be lifetime or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care you receive from your insurance companies , so you will not be surprised by the fine print that says suddenly they have stopped paying and you now suddenly are 50 , 000 or 100 , 000 or 200 , 000 out of pocket . That will not that will not happen if this becomes law this year . I see I see some young people in the audience . If you are an uninsured young adult , you will be able to stay on your parents policy until you are 26 years old under this law . So number one number one is insurance reform . The second thing that this plan would change about the current system is this For the first time , uninsured individuals , small businesses , they had have the same kind of choice of private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves . Understand if this reform becomes law , members of Congress , they will be getting their insurance from the same place that the uninsured get theirs , because if it is good enough for the American people , it is good enough for the people who send us to Washington . So basically what would happen is , we had set up a pool of people millions of people across the country would all buy into these pools that give them more negotiating power . If you work for a big company , you have got a better insurance deal because you have got more bargaining power as a whole . We want you to have all the bargaining power that the federal employees have , that big companies have , so you will be able to buy in or a small business will be able to buy into this pool . And that will lower rates , it is estimated , by up to 14 to 20 percent over what you are currently getting . That is money out of pocket . And what my proposal says is if you still cannot afford the insurance in this new marketplace , then we are going to offer you tax credits to do so . And that will add up to the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history . That is what we are going to do . Now , when I was talking about this at that health care summit , some of you saw it I sat there for about seven hours I know you guys watched the whole thing . But some of these folks said , well , we just that is a nice idea but we just cannot afford to do that . Look , I want everybody to understand the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is . The least well among us , the poorest among us , they get their health care through Medicaid . So it is the middle class , it is working people that are getting squeezed , and that is who we have to help , and we can afford to do it . Now , it is true that providing these tax credits to middle class families and small businesses , that is going to cost some money . It is going to cost about 100 billion per year . But most of this comes from the nearly 2 . 5 trillion a year that Americans already spend on health care . It is just right now , a lot of that money is being spent badly . So with this plan , we are going to make sure the dollars we make the dollars that we spend on health care are going to make insurance more affordable and more secure . And we are going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance company . Insurance companies are making billions of dollars on subsidies from you , the taxpayer . And if we take those subsidies away , we can use them to help folks like Natoma get health insurance so she does not lose her house . And , yes , we will set a new fee on insurance companies because they stand to gain millions more customers who are buying insurance . There is nothing wrong with them giving something back . But here s the bottom line Our proposal is paid for which , by the way , is more than can be said for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they passed that big prescription drug plan that cost about as much as my health care plan and they did not pay for any of it and it went straight to the deficit . And now they are up there on their high horse talking about , well , we do not want to expand the deficit . This plan does not expand the deficit . Their plan expanded the deficit . That is why we pay for what we do . That is the responsible thing to do . Now , so let me talk about the third thing , which is my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for families , for businesses , and for the federal government . So Americans buying comparable coverage to what they have today I already said this would see premiums fall by 14 to 20 percent that is not my numbers , that is what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says for Americans who get their insurance through the workplace . How many people are getting insurance through their jobs right now Raise your hands . All right . Well , a lot of those folks , your employer it is estimated would see premiums fall by as much as 3 , 000 percent , which means they could give you a raise . We have incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rising costs of health care . We go after waste and abuse in the system , especially in Medicare . Our cost cutting measures would reduce most people s premiums and bring down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades . Those are not my numbers . Those are the numbers determined by the Congressional Budget Office . They are the referee . That is what they say , not what I say . Now , the opponents of reform , they have tried to make a lot of different arguments to stop these changes . You remember . First , they said , well , there is a government takeover of health care . Well , that was not true . Well , that was not true . Then they said , well , what about death panels Well , that turned out that did not turn out to be true . You know , the most insidious argument they are making is the idea that somehow this would hurt Medicare . I know we have got some seniors here with us today I could not tell you guys look great . I would not have guessed . But want to tell you directly This proposal adds almost a decade of solvency to Medicare . This proposal would close the gap in prescription drug coverage , called the doughnut hole you know something about that that sticks seniors with thousands of dollars in drug costs . This proposal will over time help to reduce the costs of Medicare that you pay every month . This proposal would make preventive care free so you do not have to pay out of pocket for tests to keep you healthy . So yes , we are going after the waste , the fraud , the abuse in Medicare . We are eliminating some of the insurance subsidies that should be going to your care . That is because these dollars should be spent on care for seniors , not on the care and feeding of the insurance companies through sweetheart deals . And every senior should know there is no cutting of your guaranteed Medicare benefits . Period . No ifs , ands , or buts . This proposal makes Medicare stronger , it makes the coverage better , and it makes the finances more secure . And anybody who says otherwise is either misinformed or they are trying to misinform you . Do not let them hoodwink you . They are trying to hoodwink you . So , look , Ohio , that is the proposal . And I believe Congress owes the American people a final up or down vote . We need an up or down vote . It is time to vote . And now as we get closer to the vote , there is a lot of hand wringing going on . We hear a lot of people in Washington talking about politics , talking about what this means in November , talking about the poll numbers for Democrats and Republicans . We need courage . Did you hear what somebody just said That is what we need . That is why I came here today . We need courage . We need courage . You know , in the end , this debate is about far more than politics . It comes down to what kind of country do we want to be . It is about the millions of lives that would be touched and , in some cases , saved , by making health insurance more secure and more affordable . It is about a woman who is lying in a hospital bed who just wants to be able to pay for the care she needs . And the truth is , what is at stake in this debate , it is not just our ability to solve this problem it is about our ability to solve any problem . I was talking to Dennis Kucinich on the way over here about this . I said , you know what It is been such a long time since we made government on the side of ordinary working folks where we did something for them that relieved some of their struggles that made folks who work hard every day and are doing the right thing and who are looking out for the families and contributing to their communities , that just gave them a little bit of a better chance to live out their American Dream . The American people want to know if it is still possible for Washington to look out for these interests , for their future . So what they are looking for is some courage . They are waiting for us to act . They are waiting for us to lead . They do not want us putting our finger out to the wind . They do not want us reading polls . They want us to look and see what is the best thing for America , and then do what is right . And as long as I hold this office , I intend to provide that leadership . And I know these members of Congress are going to provide that leadership . I do not know about the politics , but I know what is the right thing to do . And so I am calling on Congress to pass these reforms and I am going to sign them into law . I want some courage . I want us to do the right thing , Ohio . And with your help , we are going to make it happen . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .Good evening . Tonight , I had like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq , the ongoing security challenges we face , and the need to rebuild our nation here at home . I know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans . We have now been through nearly a decade of war . We have endured a long and painful recession . And sometimes in the midst of these storms , the future that we are trying to build for our nation a future of lasting peace and long term prosperity may seem beyond our reach . But this milestone should serve as a reminder to all Americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment . It should also serve as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century . From this desk , seven and a half years ago , President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq . Much has changed since that night . A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency . Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart . Thousands of Americans gave their lives tens of thousands have been wounded . Our relations abroad were strained . Our unity at home was tested . These are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of America s longest wars . Yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides . At every turn , America s men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve . As Commander in Chief , I am incredibly proud of their service . And like all Americans , I am awed by their sacrifice , and by the sacrifices of their families . The Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given . They defeated a regime that had terrorized its people . Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own , our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future . They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people , trained Iraqi Security Forces , and took out terrorist leaders . Because of our troops and civilians and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny , even though many challenges remain . So tonight , I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended . Operation Iraqi Freedom is over , and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country . This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office . Last February , I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq , while redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraq s Security Forces and support its government and people . That is what we have done . We have removed nearly 100 , 000 troops from Iraq . We have closed or transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases . And we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq . This completes a transition to Iraqi responsibility for their own security . troops pulled out of Iraq s cities last summer , and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens . Even as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks , security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began . And Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda , removing much of its leadership in Iraqi led operations . This year also saw Iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout . A caretaker administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the results of that election . Tonight , I encourage Iraq s leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just , representative , and accountable to the Iraqi people . And when that government is in place , there should be no doubt The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States . Our combat mission is ending , but our commitment to Iraq s future is not . Going forward , a transitional force of troops will remain in Iraq with a different mission advising and assisting Iraq s Security Forces , supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions , and protecting our civilians . Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government , all troops will leave by the end of next year . As our military draws down , our dedicated civilians diplomats , aid workers , and advisors are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its government , resolves political disputes , resettles those displaced by war , and builds ties with the region and the world . That is a message that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his visit there today . This new approach reflects our long term partnership with Iraq one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect . Of course , violence will not end with our combat mission . Extremists will continue to set off bombs , attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife . But ultimately , these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals . Iraqis are a proud people . They have rejected sectarian war , and they have no interest in endless destruction . They understand that , in the end , only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets . Only Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders . What America can do , and will do , is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner . Ending this war is not only in Iraq s interest it is in our own . The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people . We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq , and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home . We have persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization . Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq , we have met our responsibility . Now , it is time to turn the page . As we do , I am mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home . Here , too , it is time to turn the page . This afternoon , I spoke to former President George Bush . It is well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its outset . Yet no one can doubt President Bush s support for our troops , or his love of country and commitment to our security . As I have said , there were patriots who supported this war , and patriots who opposed it . And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women , and our hopes for Iraqis future . The greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences , and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead . And no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al Qaeda . Americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9 11 . Now , as we approach our 10th year of combat in Afghanistan , there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there . But we must never lose sight of what is at stake . As we speak , al Qaeda continues to plot against us , and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan . We will disrupt , dismantle and defeat al Qaeda , while preventing Afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists . And because of our drawdown in Iraq , we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense . In fact , over the last 19 months , nearly a dozen al Qaeda leaders and hundreds of al Qaeda s extremist allies have been killed or captured around the world . Within Afghanistan , I have ordered the deployment of additional troops who under the command of General David Petraeus are fighting to break the Taliban s momentum . As with the surge in Iraq , these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future . But , as was the case in Iraq , we cannot do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves . That is why we are training Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistan s problems . And next August , we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility . The pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground , and our support for Afghanistan will endure . But make no mistake This transition will begin because open ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan people s . Indeed , one of the lessons of our effort in Iraq is that American influence around the world is not a function of military force alone . We must use all elements of our power including our diplomacy , our economic strength , and the power of America s example to secure our interests and stand by our allies . And we must project a vision of the future that is based not just on our fears , but also on our hopes a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world , but also the limitless possibilities of our time . Today , old adversaries are at peace , and emerging democracies are potential partners . New markets for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas . A new push for peace in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow . Billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict . As the leader of the free world , America will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people . Now , that effort must begin within our own borders . Throughout our history , America has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas , understanding its links to our own liberty and security . But we have also understood that our nation s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home . And the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class . Unfortunately , over the last decade , we have not done what is necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity . We spent a trillion dollars at war , often financed by borrowing from overseas . This , in turn , has short changed investments in our own people , and contributed to record deficits . For too long , we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform . As a result , too many middle class families find themselves working harder for less , while our nation s long term competitiveness is put at risk . And so at this moment , as we wind down the war in Iraq , we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy , and grit , and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad . They have met every test that they faced . Now , it is our turn . Now , it is our responsibility to honor them by coming together , all of us , and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it . Our most urgent task is to restore our economy , and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work . To strengthen our middle class , we must give all our children the education they deserve , and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy . We must jumpstart industries that create jobs , and end our dependence on foreign oil . We must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines , and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs . This will be difficult . But in the days to come , it must be our central mission as a people , and my central responsibility as President . Part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor . As long as I am President , we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known , and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us . This is a sacred trust . That is why we have already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades . We are treating the signature wounds of today s wars post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned . And we are funding a Post 9 11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education . Just as the GI Bill helped those who fought World War II including my grandfather become the backbone of our middle class , so today s servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy . Because part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it . Two weeks ago , America s final combat brigade in Iraq the Army s Fourth Stryker Brigade journeyed home in the pre dawn darkness . Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from Baghdad , the last of them passing into Kuwait in the early morning hours . Over seven years before , American troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways , but this time no shots were fired . It was just a convoy of brave Americans , making their way home . Of course , the soldiers left much behind . Some were teenagers when the war began . Many have served multiple tours of duty , far from families who bore a heroic burden of their own , enduring the absence of a husband s embrace or a mother s kiss . Most painfully , since the war began , 55 members of the Fourth Stryker Brigade made the ultimate sacrifice part of over 4 , 400 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq . As one staff sergeant said , I know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died , this day would probably mean a lot . Those Americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries . Along with nearly 1 . 5 million Americans who have served in Iraq , they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew . They stared into the darkest of human creations war and helped the Iraqi people seek the light of peace . In an age without surrender ceremonies , we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation . Every American who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg from Iwo Jima to Inchon from Khe Sanh to Kandahar Americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own . Our troops are the steel in our ship of state . And though our nation may be travelling through rough waters , they give us confidence that our course is true , and that beyond the pre dawn darkness , better days lie ahead . Thank you . May God bless you . And may God bless the United States of America , and all who serve her .Mr . President , Mr . Secretary General , my fellow delegates , ladies and gentlemen . It is a great honor to address this Assembly for the second time , nearly two years after my election as President of the United States . We know this is no ordinary time for our people . Each of us comes here with our own problems and priorities . But there are also challenges that we share in common as leaders and as nations . We meet within an institution built from the rubble of war , designed to unite the world in pursuit of peace . And we meet within a city that for centuries has welcomed people from across the globe , demonstrating that individuals of every color , faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity , build a community , and live with the blessing of human liberty . Outside the doors of this hall , the blocks and neighborhoods of this great city tell the story of a difficult decade . Nine years ago , the destruction of the World Trade Center signaled a threat that respected no boundary of dignity or decency . Two years ago this month , a financial crisis on Wall Street devastated American families on Main Street . These separate challenges have affected people around the globe . Men and women and children have been murdered by extremists from Casablanca to London from Jalalabad to Jakarta . The global economy suffered an enormous blow during the financial crisis , crippling markets and deferring the dreams of millions on every continent . Underneath these challenges to our security and prosperity lie deeper fears that ancient hatreds and religious divides are once again ascendant that a world which has grown more interconnected has somehow slipped beyond our control . These are some of the challenges that my administration has confronted since we came into office . And today , I had like to talk to you about what we have done over the last 20 months to meet these challenges what our responsibility is to pursue peace in the Middle East and what kind of world we are trying to build in this 21st century . Let me begin with what we have done . I have had no greater focus as President than rescuing our economy from potential catastrophe . And in an age when prosperity is shared , we could not do this alone . So America has joined with nations around the world to spur growth , and the renewed demand that could restart job creation . We are reforming our system of global finance , beginning with Wall Street reform here at home , so that a crisis like this never happens again . And we made the G20 the focal point for international coordination , because in a world where prosperity is more diffuse , we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerging economies economies from every corner of the globe . There is much to show for our efforts , even as there is much work to be done . The global economy has been pulled back from the brink of a depression , and is growing once more . We have resisted protectionism , and are exploring ways to expand trade and commerce among nations . But we cannot and will not rest until these seeds of progress grow into a broader prosperity , not only for all Americans , but for peoples around the globe . As for our common security , America is waging a more effective fight against al Qaeda , while winding down the war in Iraq . Since I took office , the United States has removed nearly 100 , 000 troops from Iraq . We have done so responsibly , as Iraqis have transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of their country . We are now focused on building a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people , while keeping our commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the end of next year . While drawing down in Iraq , we have refocused on defeating al Qaeda and denying its affiliates a safe haven . In Afghanistan , the United States and our allies are pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban s momentum and build the capacity of Afghanistan s government and security forces , so that a transition to Afghan responsibility can begin next July . And from South Asia to the Horn of Africa , we are moving toward a more targeted approach one that strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist networks without deploying large American armies . As we pursue the world s most dangerous extremists , we are also denying them the world s most dangerous weapons , and pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons . Earlier this year , 47 nations embraced a work plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years . We have joined with Russia to sign the most comprehensive arms control treaty in decades . We have reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy . And here , at the United Nations , we came together to strengthen the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty . As part of our effort on non proliferation , I offered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended hand last year , and underscored that it has both rights and responsibilities as a member of the international community . I also said in this hall that Iran must be held accountable if it failed to meet those responsibilities . And that is what we have done . Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear program , and those actions have consequences . Through Security Council Resolution 1929 , we made it clear that international law is not an empty promise . Now let me be clear once more The United States and the international community seek a resolution to our differences with Iran , and the door remains open to diplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it . But the Iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program . As we combat the spread of deadly weapons , we are also confronting the specter of climate change . After making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at home , we helped forge an accord in Copenhagen that for the first time commits all major economies to reduce their emissions . We are keenly aware this is just a first step . And going forward , we will support a process in which all major economies meet our responsibilities to protect the planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development . America has also embraced unique responsibilities with come that come with our power . Since the rains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan , we have pledged our assistance , and we should all support the Pakistani people as they recover and rebuild . And when the earth shook and Haiti was devastated by loss , we joined a coalition of nations in response . Today , we honor those from the family who lost their lives in the earthquake , and commit ourselves to stand with the people of Haiti until they can stand on their own two feet . Amidst this upheaval , we have also been persistent in our pursuit of peace . Last year , I pledged my best efforts to support the goal of two states , Israel and Palestine , living side by side in peace and security , as part of a comprehensive peace between Israel and all of its neighbors . We have travelled a winding road over the last 12 months , with few peaks and many valleys . But this month , I am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington , Sharm el Sheikh and Jerusalem . Now I recognize many are pessimistic about this process . The cynics say that Israelis and Palestinians are too distrustful of each other , and too divided internally , to forge lasting peace . Rejectionists on both sides will try to disrupt the process , with bitter words and with bombs and with gunfire . Some say that the gaps between the parties are too big the potential for talks to break down is too great and that after decades of failure , peace is simply not possible . I hear those voices of skepticism . But I ask you to consider the alternative . If an agreement is not reached , Palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that comes with their own state . Israelis will never know the certainty and security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbors who are committed to coexistence . The hard realities of demography will take hold . More blood will be shed . This Holy Land will remain a symbol of our differences , instead of our common humanity . I refuse to accept that future . And we all have a choice to make . Each of us must choose the path of peace . Of course , that responsibility begins with the parties themselves , who must answer the call of history . Earlier this month at the White House , I was struck by the words of both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders . Prime Minister Netanyahu said , I came here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace , security , and dignity . And President Abbas said , We will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause . These words must now be followed by action and I believe that both leaders have the courage to do so . But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly difficult , which is why I call upon Israelis and Palestinians and the world to rally behind the goal that these leaders now share . We know that there will be tests along the way and that one test is fast approaching . Israel s settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks . And our position on this issue is well known . We believe that the moratorium should be extended . We also believe that talks should press on until completed . Now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this obstacle . Now is the time to build the trust and provide the time for substantial progress to be made . Now is the time for this opportunity to be seized , so that it does not slip away . Now , peace must be made by Israelis and Palestinians , but each of us has a responsibility to do our part as well . Those of us who are friends of Israel must understand that true security for the Jewish state requires an independent Palestine one that allows the Palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity . And those of us who are friends of the Palestinians must understand that the rights of the Palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means including genuine reconciliation with a secure Israel . I know many in this hall count themselves as friends of the Palestinians . But these pledges of friendship must now be supported by deeds . Those who have signed on to the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps towards the normalization that it promises Israel . And those who speak on behalf of Palestinian self government should help the Palestinian Authority politically and financially , and in doing so help the Palestinians build the institutions of their state . Those who long to see an independent Palestine must also stop trying to tear down Israel . After thousands of years , Jews and Arabs are not strangers in a strange land . After 60 years in the community of nations , Israel s existence must not be a subject for debate . Israel is a sovereign state , and the historic homeland of the Jewish people . It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel s legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States . And efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian people . The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance it is injustice . And make no mistake The courage of a man like President Abbas , who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances , is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children . The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old as this institution . And we can come back here next year , as we have for the last 60 years , and make long speeches about it . We can read familiar lists of grievances . We can table the same resolutions . We can further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate . And we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that will not help a single Israeli or Palestinian child achieve a better life . We can do that . Or , we can say that this time will be different that this time we will not let terror , or turbulence , or posturing , or petty politics stand in the way . This time , we will think not of ourselves , but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams , or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire . This time , we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see Jerusalem s soil as sacred . This time we should reach for what is best within ourselves . If we do , when we come back here next year , we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations an independent , sovereign state of Palestine , living in peace with Israel . It is our destiny to bear the burdens of the challenges that I have addressed recession and war and conflict . And there is always a sense of urgency even emergency that drives most of our foreign policies . Indeed , after millennia marked by wars , this very institution reflects the desire of human beings to create a forum to deal with emergencies that will inevitably come . But even as we confront immediate challenges , we must also summon the foresight to look beyond them , and consider what we are trying to build over the long term What is the world that awaits us when today s battles are brought to an end And that is what I would like to talk about with the remainder of my time today . One of the first actions of this General Assembly was to adopt a Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 . That Declaration begins by stating that , recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice , and peace in the world . The idea is a simple one that freedom , justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom , justice , and peace in the lives of individual human beings . And for the United States , this is a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity . As Robert Kennedy said , the individual man , the child of God , is the touchstone of value , and all society , groups , the state , exist for his benefit . So we stand up for universal values because it is the right thing to do . But we also know from experience that those who defend these values for their people have been our closest friends and allies , while those who have denied those rights whether terrorist groups or tyrannical governments have chosen to be our adversaries . Human rights have never gone unchallenged not in any of our nations , and not in our world . Tyranny is still with us whether it manifests itself in the Taliban killing girls who try to go to school , a North Korean regime that enslaves its own people , or an armed group in Congo Kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war . In times of economic unease , there can also be an anxiety about human rights . Today , as in past times of economic downturn , some put human rights aside for the promise of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom . We see leaders abolishing term limits . We see crackdowns on civil society . We see corruption smothering entrepreneurship and good governance . We see democratic reforms deferred indefinitely . As I said last year , each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its own people . Yet experience shows us that history is on the side of liberty that the strongest foundation for human progress lies in open economies , open societies , and open governments . To put it simply , democracy , more than any other form of government , delivers for our citizens . And I believe that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the borders between nations are blurred . America is working to shape a world that fosters this openness , for the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings . All of us want the right to educate our children , to make a decent wage , to care for the sick , and to be carried as far as our dreams and our deeds will take us . But that depends upon economies that tap the power of our people , including the potential of women and girls . That means letting entrepreneurs start a business without paying a bribe and governments that support opportunity instead of stealing from their people . And that means rewarding hard work , instead of reckless risk taking . Yesterday , I put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goals , recognizing that dignity is a human right and global development is in our common interest . America will partner with nations that offer their people a path out of poverty . And together , we must unleash growth that powers by individuals and emerging markets in all parts of the globe . There is no reason why Africa should not be an exporter of agriculture , which is why our food security initiative is empowering farmers . There is no reason why entrepreneurs should not be able to build new markets in every society , which is why I hosted a summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring , because the obligation of government is to empower individuals , not to impede them . The same holds true for civil society . The arc of human progress has been shaped by individuals with the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside of government that insisted upon democratic change and by free media that held the powerful accountable . We have seen that from the South Africans who stood up to apartheid , to the Poles of Solidarity , to the mothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the Dirty War , to Americans who marched for the rights of all races , including my own . Civil society is the conscience of our communities and America will always extend our engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of government . And we will call out those who suppress ideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless . We will promote new tools of communication so people are empowered to connect with one another and , in repressive societies , to do so with security . We will support a free and open Internet , so individuals have the information to make up their own minds . And it is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms that advance the rights of civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across borders . Open society supports open government , but it cannot substitute for it . There is no right more fundamental than the ability to choose your leaders and determine your destiny . Now , make no mistake The ultimate success of democracy in the world will not come because the United States dictates it it will come because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed . There is no soil where this notion cannot take root , just as every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation . Later this fall , I will travel to Asia . And I will visit India , which peacefully threw off colonialism and established a thriving democracy of over a billion people . I will continue to Indonesia , the world s largest Muslim majority country , which binds together thousands of islands through the glue of representative government and civil society . I will join the G20 meeting on the Korean Peninsula , which provides the world s clearest contrast between a society that is dynamic and open and free , and one that is imprisoned and closed . And I will conclude my trip in Japan , an ancient culture that found peace and extraordinary development through democracy . Each of these countries gives life to democratic principles in their own way . And even as some governments roll back reform , we also celebrate the courage of a President in Colombia who willingly stepped aside , or the promise of a new constitution in Kenya . The common thread of progress is the principle that government is accountable to its citizens . And the diversity in this room makes clear no one country has all the answers , but all of us must answer to our own people . In all parts of the world , we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable . And now , we must build on that progress . And when we gather back here next year , we should bring specific commitments to promote transparency to fight corruption to energize civic engagement to leverage new technologies so that we strengthen the foundations of freedom in our own countries , while living up to the ideals that can light the world . This institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights . It is time to welcome the efforts of Women to protect the rights of women around the globe . It is time for every member state to open its elections to international monitors and increase the Democracy Fund . It is time to reinvigorate peacekeeping , so that missions have the resources necessary to succeed , and so atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and justice is enforced because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security . And it is time to make this institution more accountable as well , because the challenges of a new century demand new ways of serving our common interests . The world that America seeks is not one we can build on our own . For human rights to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression , we need your voices to speak out . In particular , I appeal to those nations who emerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the second half of the last century from South Africa to South Asia from Eastern Europe to South America . Do not stand idly by , do not be silent , when dissidents elsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten . Recall your own history . Because part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others . That belief will guide America s leadership in this 21st century . It is a belief that has seen us through more than two centuries of trial , and it will see us through the challenges we face today be it war or recession conflict or division . So even as we have come through a difficult decade , I stand here before you confident in the future a future where Iraq is governed by neither tyrant nor a foreign power , and Afghanistan is freed from the turmoil of war a future where the children of Israel and Palestine can build the peace that was not possible for their parents a world where the promise of development reaches into the prisons of poverty and disease a future where the cloud of recession gives way to the light of renewal and the dream of opportunity is available to all . This future will not be easy to reach . It will not come without setbacks , nor will it be quickly claimed . But the founding of the United Nations itself is a testament to human progress . Remember , in times that were far more trying than our own , our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and equality of human beings would be our common cause . It falls to us to fulfill that promise . And though we will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve , Americans have always had cause to believe that we can choose a better history that we need only to look outside the walls around us . For through the citizens of every conceivable ancestry who make this city their own , we see living proof that opportunity can be accessed by all , that what unites us as human beings is far greater than what divides us , and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace . Thank you very much .Good afternoon , everybody . Last night I had a chance to speak to the leaders of the House and the Senate and reached out to those who had both won and lost in both parties . I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell that I look forward to working with them . And I thanked Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for their extraordinary leadership over the last two years . After what I am sure was a long night for a lot of you and needless to say it was for me I can tell you that some election nights are more fun than others . Some are exhilarating some are humbling . But every election , regardless of who wins and who loses , is a reminder that in our democracy , power rests not with those of us in elected office , but with the people we have the privilege to serve . Over the last few months I have had the opportunity to travel around the country and meet people where they live and where they work , from backyards to factory floors . I did some talking , but mostly I did a lot of listening . And yesterday s vote confirmed what I have heard from folks all across America People are frustrated they are deeply frustrated with the pace of our economic recovery and the opportunities that they hope for their children and their grandchildren . They want jobs to come back faster , they want paychecks to go further , and they want the ability to give their children the same chances and opportunities as they have had in life . The men and women who sent us here do not expect Washington to solve all their problems . But they do expect Washington to work for them , not against them . They want to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely , not wasted , and that we are not going to leave our children a legacy of debt . They want to know that their voices are not being drowned out by a sea of lobbyists and special interests and partisan bickering . They want business to be done here openly and honestly . Now , I ran for this office to tackle these challenges and give voice to the concerns of everyday people . Over the last two years , we have made progress . But , clearly , too many Americans have not felt that progress yet , and they told us that yesterday . And as President , I take responsibility for that . What yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here , that we must find common ground in order to set in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges . And I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell last night I am very eager to sit down with members of both parties and figure out how we can move forward together . I am not suggesting this will be easy . I will not pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement . There is a reason we have two parties in this country , and both Democrats and Republicans have certain beliefs and certain principles that each feels cannot be compromised . But what I think the American people are expecting , and what we owe them , is to focus on those issues that affect their jobs , their security , and their future reducing our deficit , promoting a clean energy economy , making sure that our children are the best educated in the world , making sure that we are making the investments in technology that will allow us to keep our competitive edge in the global economy . Because the most important contest we face is not the contest between Democrats and Republicans . In this century , the most important competition we face is between America and our economic competitors around the world . To win that competition , and to continue our economic leadership , we are going to need to be strong and we are going to need to be united . None of the challenges we face lend themselves to simple solutions or bumper sticker slogans . Nor are the answers found in any one particular philosophy or ideology . As I have said before , no person , no party , has a monopoly on wisdom . And that is why I am eager to hear good ideas wherever they come from , whoever proposes them . And that is why I believe it is important to have an honest and civil debate about the choices that we face . That is why I want to engage both Democrats and Republicans in serious conversations about where we are going as a nation . And with so much at stake , what the American people do not want from us , especially here in Washington , is to spend the next two years refighting the political battles of the last two . We just had a tough election . We will have another in 2012 . I am not so na iuml ve as to think that everybody will put politics aside until then , but I do hope to make progress on the very serious problems facing us right now . And that is going to require all of us , including me , to work harder at building consensus . You know , a little over a month ago , we held a town hall meeting in Richmond , Virginia . And one of the most telling questions came from a small business owner who runs a tree care firm . He told me how hard he works and how busy he was how he does not have time to pay attention to all the back and forth in Washington . And he asked , is there hope for us returning to civility in our discourse , to a healthy legislative process , so as I strap on the boots again tomorrow , I know that you guys got it under control It is hard to have a faith in that right now , he said . I do believe there is hope for civility . I do believe there is hope for progress . And that is because I believe in the resiliency of a nation that is bounced back from much worse than what we are going through right now a nation that is overcome war and depression , that has been made more perfect in our struggle for individual rights and individual freedoms . Each time progress has come slowly and even painfully , but progress has always come because we have worked at it and because we have believed in it , and most of all , because we remembered that our first allegiance as citizens is not to party or region or faction , but to country because while we may be proud Democrats or proud Republicans , we are prouder to be Americans . And that is something that we all need to remember right now and in the coming months . And if we do , I have no doubt that we will continue this nation s long journey towards a better future . So with that , let me take some questions . I am going to start off with Ben Feller at AP . I think that there is no doubt that people s number one concern is the economy . And what they were expressing great frustration about is the fact that we have not made enough progress on the economy . We have stabilized the economy . We have got job growth in the private sectors . But people all across America are not feeling that progress . They do not see it . And they understand that I am the President of the United States , and that my core responsibility is making sure that we have got an economy that is growing , a middle class that feels secure , that jobs are being created . And so I think I have got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make . Now , moving forward , I think the question is going to be can Democrats and Republicans sit down together and come up with a set of ideas that address those core concerns . I am confident that we can . I think that there are some areas where it is going to be very difficult for us to agree on , but I think there are going to be a whole bunch of areas where we can agree on . I do not think there is anybody in America who thinks that we have got an energy policy that works the way it needs to that thinks that we should not be working on energy independence . And that gives opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to come together and think about , whether it is natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric cars in this country , how do we move forward on that agenda . I think everybody in this country thinks that we have got to make sure our kids are equipped in terms of their education , their science background , their math backgrounds , to compete in this new global economy . And that is going to be an area where I think there is potential common ground . So on a whole range of issues , there are going to be areas where we disagree . I think the overwhelming message that I hear from the voters is that we want everybody to act responsibly in Washington . We want you to work harder to arrive at consensus . We want you to focus completely on jobs and the economy and growing it , so that we are ensuring a better future for our children and our grandchildren . And I think that there is no doubt that as I reflect on the results of the election , it underscores for me that I have got to do a better job , just like everybody else in Washington does . Well , I think John Boehner and I and Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are going to have to sit down and work together because I suspect that if you talk to any individual voter yesterday , they had say , there are some things I agree with Democrats on , there are some things I agree with Republicans on . I do not think people carry around with them a fixed ideology . I think the majority of people , they are going about their business , going about their lives . They just want to make sure that we are making progress . And that is going to be my top priority over the next couple of years . Savannah Guthrie . Well , Savannah , that was just the first question , so we are going to have a few more here . I am doing a whole lot of reflecting and I think that there are going to be areas in policy where we are going to have to do a better job . I think that over the last two years , we have made a series of very tough decisions , but decisions that were right in terms of moving the country forward in an emergency situation where we had the risk of slipping into a second Great Depression . But what is absolutely true is that with all that stuff coming at folks fast and furious a recovery package , what we had to do with respect to the banks , what we had to do with respect to the auto companies I think people started looking at all this and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people s lives than they were accustomed to . Now , the reason was it was an emergency situation . But I think it is understandable that folks said to themselves , you know , maybe this is the agenda , as opposed to a response to an emergency . And that is something that I think everybody in the White House understood was a danger . We thought it was necessary , but I am sympathetic to folks who looked at it and said this is looking like potential overreach . In addition , there were a bunch of price tags that went with that . And so , even though these were emergency situations , people rightly said , gosh , we already have all this debt , we already have these big deficits this is potentially going to compound it , and at what point are we going to get back to a situation where we are doing what families all around the country do , which is make sure that if you spend something you know how to pay for it as opposed to racking up the credit card for the next generation . And I think that the other thing that happened is that when I won election in 2008 , one of the reasons I think that people were excited about the campaign was the prospect that we would change how business is done in Washington . And we were in such a hurry to get things done that we did not change how things got done . And I think that frustrated people . I am a strong believer that the earmarking process in Congress is not what the American people really want to see when it comes to making tough decisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent . And in the rush to get things done , had to sign a bunch of bills that had earmarks in them , which was contrary to what I had talked about . And I think folks look at that and they said , gosh , this feels like the same partisan squabbling , this seems like the same ways of doing business as happened before . And so one of the things that I have got to take responsibility for is not having moved enough on those fronts . And I think there is an opportunity to move forward on some of those issues . My understanding is Eric Cantor today said that he wanted to see a moratorium on earmarks continuing . That is something I think we can we can work on together . Well , Savannah , I think that what I think is absolutely true is voters are not satisfied with the outcomes . If right now we had 5 percent unemployment instead of 9 . 6 percent unemployment , then people would have more confidence in those policy choices . The fact is , is that for most folks , proof of whether they work or not is has the economy gotten back to where it needs to be . And it has not . And so my job is to make sure that I am looking at all ideas that are on the table . When it comes to job creation , if Republicans have good ideas for job growth that can drive down the unemployment rate , and we have not thought of them , we have not looked at them but we think they have a chance of working , we want to try some . So on the policy front , I think the most important thing is to say that we are not going to rule out ideas because they are Democrat or Republican we want to just see what works . And ultimately , I will be judged as President as to the bottom line , results . Mike Emanuel . Well , I know that there is some Republican candidates who won last night who feel very strongly about it . I am sure that this will be an issue that comes up in discussions with the Republican leadership . As I said before , though , I think we had be misreading the election if we thought that the American people want to see us for the next two years relitigate arguments that we had over the last two years . With respect to the health care law , generally and this may go to some of the questions that Savannah was raising you know , when I talk to a woman from New Hampshire who does not have to mortgage her house because she got cancer and is seeking treatment but now is able to get health insurance , when I talk to parents who are relieved that their child with a preexisting condition can now stay on their policy until they are 26 years old and give them time to transition to find a job that will give them health insurance , or the small businesses that are now taking advantage of the tax credits that are provided then I say to myself , this was the right thing to do . Now , if the Republicans have ideas for how to improve our health care system , if they want to suggest modifications that would deliver faster and more effective reform to a health care system that has been wildly expensive for too many families and businesses and certainly for our federal government , I am happy to consider some of those ideas . You know , for example , I know one of the things that is come up is that the 1099 provision in the health care bill appears to be too burdensome for small businesses . It just involves too much paperwork , too much filing . It is probably counterproductive . It was designed to make sure that revenue was raised to help pay for some of the other provisions , but if it ends up just being so much trouble that small businesses find it difficult to manage , that is something that we should take a look at . So there are going to be examples where I think we can tweak and make improvements on the progress that we have made . That is true for any significant piece of legislation . But I do not think that if you ask the American people , should we stop trying to close the doughnut hole that will help senior citizens get prescription drugs , should we go back to a situation where people with preexisting conditions cannot get health insurance , should we allow insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick even though you have been paying premiums I do not think that you had have a strong vote for people saying those are provisions I want to eliminate . Well , it also means one out of two voters think it was the right thing to do . And obviously this is an issue that has been contentious . But as I said , I think what is going to be useful is for us to go through the issues that Republicans have issues on not sort of talking generally , but let us talk specifics . Does this particular provision when it comes to preexisting conditions , is this something you are for or you are against Helping seniors get their prescription drugs does that make sense or not And if we take that approach which is different from campaigning I mean , this is now governing then I think that we can continue to make some progress and find some common ground . Chip Reid . Well , I think this is going to be an important question for Democrats and Republicans . I think the American people are absolutely concerned about spending and debt and deficits . And I am going to have a deficit commission that is putting forward its ideas . It is a bipartisan group that includes Republican and Democratic members of Congress . Hopefully they were able to arrive at some consensus on some areas where we can eliminate programs that do not work , cut back on government spending that is inefficient , can streamline government , but is not cutting into the core investments that are going to make sure that we are a competitive economy that is growing and providing opportunity for years to come . So the question I think that my Republican friends and me and Democratic leaders are going to have answer is , what are our priorities What do we care about And that is going to be a tough debate , because there are some tough choices here . We already had a big deficit that I inherited , and that has been made worse because of the recession . As we bring it down , I want to make sure that we are not cutting into education that is going to help define whether or not we can compete around the world . I do not think we should be cutting back on research and development , because if we can develop new technologies in areas like clean energy , that could make all the difference in terms of job creation here at home . I think the proposal that I put forward with respect to infrastructure is one that historically we have had bipartisan agreement about . And we should be able to agree now that it makes no sense for China to have better rail systems than us , and Singapore having better airports than us . And we just learned that China now has the fastest supercomputer on Earth that used to be us . They are making investments because they know those investments will pay off over the long term . And so in these budget discussions , the key is to be able to distinguish between stuff that is not adding to our growth , is not an investment in our future , and those things that are absolutely necessary for us to be able to increase job growth in the future as well . Now , the single most important thing I think we need to do economically and this is something that has to be done during the lame duck session is making sure that taxes do not go up on middle class families next year . And so we have got some work to do on that front to make sure that families not only are not seeing a higher tax burden which will automatically happen if Congress does not act but also making sure that business provisions that historically we have extended each year that , for example , provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States in research and development , that those are extended . I think it makes sense for us to extend unemployment insurance because there are still a lot of folks out there hurting . So there are some things that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it , even as we are also sitting down and figuring out , okay , over the next several years what kinds of budget cuts can we make that are intelligent , that are smart , that will not be undermining our recovery but , in fact , will be encouraging job growth . Well , what is absolutely true is , is that without any Republican support on anything , then it is going to be hard to get things done . But I am not going to anticipate that they are not going to support anything . I think that part of the message sent to Republicans was we want to see stronger job growth in this country . And if there are good ideas about putting people to work that traditionally have garnered Republican support and that do not add to the deficit , then my hope is and expectation is , is that that is something they are willing to have a serious conversation about . When it comes to , for example , the proposal we put forward to accelerate depreciation for business , so that if they are building a plant or investing in new equipment next year , that they can take a complete write off next year , get a huge tax break next year , and that would then encourage a lot of businesses to get off the sidelines that is not historically considered a liberal idea . That is actually an idea that business groups and Republicans I think have supported for a very long time . So again , the question is going to be do we all come to the table with an open mind and say to ourselves , what do we think is actually going to make a difference for the American people That is how we are going to be judged over the next couple of years . Peter Baker . Well , I think I have been willing to compromise in the past and I am going to be willing to compromise going forward on a whole range of issues . Let me give you an example the issue of energy that I just mentioned . I think there are a lot of Republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the House last year . And so it is doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the House this year or next year or the year after . But that does not mean there is not agreement that we should have a better energy policy . And so let us find those areas where we can agree . We have got , I think , broad agreement that we have got terrific natural gas resources in this country . Are we doing everything we can to develop those There is a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric cars are developed here in the United States , that we do not fall behind other countries . Are there things that we can do to encourage that And there is already been bipartisan interest on those issues . There is been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases . Is that an area where we can move forward We were able , over the last two years , to increase for the first time in 30 years fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks . We did not even need legislation . We just needed the cooperation of automakers and autoworkers and investors and other shareholders . And that is going to move us forward in a serious way . So I think when it comes to something like energy , what we are probably going to have to do is say here are some areas where there is just too much disagreement between Democrats and Republicans , we cannot get this done right now , but let us not wait . Let us go ahead and start making some progress on the things that we do agree on , and we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those areas where we do not . You know , I am sure there are going to be areas , particularly around , for example , reforming how Washington works , that I will be interested in . I think the American people want to see more transparency , more openness . As I said , in the midst of economic crisis , I think one of the things I take responsibility for is not having pushed harder on some of those issues . And I think if you take Republicans and Democrats at their word this is an area that they want to deliver on for the American people , I want to be supportive of that effort . Jake Tapper . And the second one is , President Bush when he went through a similar thing came out and he said this was a thumpin . You talked about how it was humbling , or you alluded to it perhaps being humbling . And I am wondering , when you call your friends , like Congressman Perriello or Governor Strickland , and you see 19 state legislatures go to the other side , governorships in swing states , the Democratic Party set back , what does it feel like It feels bad . You know , the toughest thing over the last couple of days is seeing really terrific public servants not have the opportunity to serve anymore , at least in the short term . And you mentioned there are just some terrific members of Congress who took really tough votes because they thought it was the right thing , even though they knew this could cause them political problems , and even though a lot of them came from really tough swing districts or majority Republican districts . And the amount of courage that they showed and conviction that they showed is something that I admire so much . I cannot overstate it . And so there is a not only sadness about seeing them go , but there is also a lot of questioning on my part in terms of could I have done something differently or done something more so that those folks would still be here . It is hard . And I take responsibility for it in a lot of ways . I will tell you , they have been incredibly gracious when I have conversations with them . And what they have told me is , you know , we do not have regrets because I feel like we were doing the right thing . And they may be just saying that to make me feel better , which , again , is a sign of their character and their class . And I hope a lot of them continue to pursue public service because I think they are terrific public servants . With respect to the tax cut issue , my goal is to make sure that we do not have a huge spike in taxes for middle class families . Not only would that be a terrible burden on families who are already going through tough times , it would be bad for our economy . It is very important that we are not taking a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who are most likely to spend that money on goods , services , groceries , buying a new winter coat for the kids . That is also why I think unemployment insurance is important . Not only is it the right thing to do for folks who are still looking for work and struggling in this really tough economy , but it is the right thing to do for the economy as a whole . So my goal is to sit down with Speaker elect Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Harry and Nancy sometime in the next few weeks and see where we can move forward in a way that , first of all , does no harm that extends those tax cuts that are very important for middle class families also extends those provisions that are important to encourage businesses to invest , and provide businesses some certainty over the next year or two . And how that negotiation works itself out I think is too early to say . But this is going to be one of my top priorities , and my hope is , is that given we all have an interest in growing the economy and encouraging job growth , that we are not going to play brinksmanship but instead we are going to act responsibly . Absolutely . Laura Meckler . And secondly , just to follow up on what you said about changing the way Washington works , do you think that you said you did not do enough to change the way things were handled in this city . Some of in order to get your health care bill passed you needed to make some of those deals . Do you wish , in retrospect , you had not made those deals even if it meant the collapse of the program I think that making sure that families had security and were on a trajectory to lower health care costs was absolutely critical for this country . But you are absolutely right that when you are navigating through a House and a Senate in this kind of pretty partisan environment that it is a ugly mess when it comes to process . And I think that is something that really affected how people viewed the outcome . That is something that I regret that we could not have made the process more healthier than it ended up being . But I think the outcome was a good one . With respect to the EPI think the smartest thing for us to do is to see if we can get Democrats and Republicans in a room who are serious about energy independence and are serious about keeping our air clean and our water clean and dealing with the issue of greenhouse gases and seeing are there ways that we can make progress in the short term and invest in technologies in the long term that start giving us the tools to reduce greenhouse gases and solve this problem . The EPA is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction . And I think one of the things that is very important for me is not to have us ignore the science , but rather to find ways that we can solve these problems that do not hurt the economy , that encourage the development of clean energy in this country , that , in fact , may give us opportunities to create entire new industries and create jobs that and that put us in a competitive posture around the world . So I think it is too early to say whether or not we can make some progress on that front . I think we can . Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat it was not the only way . It was a means , not an end . And I am going to be looking for other means to address this problem . And I think EPA wants help from the legislature on this . I do not think that the desire is to somehow be protective of their powers here . I think what they want to do is make sure that the issue is being dealt with . Ed Henry . And just on a policy front , do not ask , do not tell is something that you promised to end . And when you had 60 votes and 59 votes in the Senate it is a tough issue you have not been able to do it . Do you now have to tell your liberal base that with maybe 52 or 53 votes in the Senate , you are just not going to be able to get it done in the next two years Well , let me take the second issue first . I have been a strong believer in the notion that if somebody is willing to serve in our military , in uniform , putting their lives on the line for our security , that they should not be prevented from doing so because of their sexual orientation . And since there is been a lot of discussion about polls over the last 48 hours , I think it is worth noting that the overwhelming majority of Americans feel the same way . It is the right thing to do . Now , as Commander in Chief , I have said that making this change needs to be done in an orderly fashion . I have worked with the Pentagon , worked with Secretary Gates , worked with Admiral Mullen to make sure that we are looking at this in a systemic way that maintains good order and discipline , but that we need to change this policy . There is going to be a review that comes out at the beginning of the month that will have surveyed attitudes and opinions within the armed forces . I will expect that Secretary of Defense Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen will have something to say about that review . I will look at it very carefully . But that will give us time to act in potentially during the lame duck session to change this policy . Keep in mind we have got a bunch of court cases that are out there as well . And something that would be very disruptive to good order and discipline and unit cohesion is if we have got this issue bouncing around in the courts , as it already has over the last several weeks , where the Pentagon and the chain of command does not know at any given time what rules they are working under . We need to provide certainty and it is time for us to move this policy forward . And this should not be a partisan issue . This is an issue , as I said , where you have got a sizable portion of the American people squarely behind the notion that folks who are willing to serve on our behalf should be treated fairly and equally . Now , in terms of how we move forward , I think that the American people understand that we are still digging our way out of a pretty big mess . So I do not think anybody denies they think we are in a ditch . I just do not think they feel like we have gotten all the way out of the ditch yet . And to move the analogy forward that I used in the campaign , I think what they want right now is the Democrats and the Republicans both pushing some more to get the car on level ground . And we have not done that . If you think I was engaging in too much campaign rhetoric , saying the Republicans were just sitting on the side of the road , watching us get that car out of the ditch , at the very least we were pushing in opposite directions . And so Yes . And I think , look , here s the bottom line . When I came into office , this economy was in a freefall , and the economy has stabilized . The economy is growing . We have seen nine months of private sector job growth . So I think it would be hard to argue that we are going backwards . I think what you can argue is we are stuck in neutral . We are not moving the way we need to , to make sure that folks have the jobs , have the opportunity , are seeing economic growth in their communities the way they need to . And that is going to require Democrats and Republicans to come together and look for the best ideas to move things forward . It will not be easy , not just because Democrats and Republicans may have different priorities , as we were just discussing when it came to how we structure tax cuts , but because these issues are hard . The Republicans throughout the campaign said they are very concerned about debt and deficits . Well , one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficits is economic growth . So what other proposals do they have to grow the economy If , in fact , they are rejecting some of the proposals I have made , I want to hear from them what affirmative policies can make a difference in terms of encouraging job growth and promoting the economy because I do not think that tax cuts alone are going to be a recipe for the kind of expansion that we need . From 2001 to 2009 , we cut taxes pretty significantly , and we just did not see the kind of expansion that is going to be necessary in terms of driving the unemployment rate down significantly . So I think what we are going to need to do and what the American people want is for us to mix and match ideas , figure out those areas where we can agree on , move forward on those , disagree without being disagreeable on those areas that we cannot agree on . If we accomplish that , then there will be time for politics later , but over the next year I think we can solidify this recovery and give people a little more confidence out there . Hans Nichols . I might serve they are delicious drinks . The Slurpee Summit that is good , Chuck . I like that . Yes , I think this is an important question that we have been asking ourselves for several months now . You are right , as I reflect on what is happened over the last two years , one of the things that I think has not been managed by me as well as it needed to be was finding the right balance in making sure that businesses have rules of the road and are treating customers fairly and whether it is their credit cards or insurance or their mortgages but also making absolutely clear that the only way America succeeds is if businesses are succeeding . The reason we have got a unparalleled standard of living in the history of the world is because we have got a free market that is dynamic and entrepreneurial , and that free market has to be nurtured and cultivated . And there is no doubt that when you had the financial crisis on Wall Street , the bonus controversies , the battle around health care , the battle around financial reform , and then you had BP you just had a successive set of issues in which I think business took the message that , well , gosh , it seems like we may be always painted at the bad guy . And so I have got to take responsibility in terms of making sure that I make clear to the business community as well as to the country that the most important thing we can do is to boost and encourage our business sector and make sure that they are hiring . And so we do have specific plans in terms of how we can structure that outreach . Now , keep in mind over the last two years , we have been talking to CEOs constantly . And as I plan for my trip later this week to Asia , the whole focus is on how are we going to open up markets so that American businesses can prosper , and we can sell more goods and create more jobs here in the United States . And a whole bunch of corporate executives are going to be joining us so that I can help them open up those markets and allow them to sell their products . So there is been a lot of strong interaction behind the scenes . But I think setting the right tone publicly is going to be important and could end up making a difference at the margins in terms of how businesses make investment decisions . Well , I already discussed a couple with Chip that have not been acted on yet . You are right that I made these proposals two months ago , but or three months ago but it was in the midst of a campaign season where it was doubtful that they were going to get a full hearing , just because there was so much political noise going on . I think as we move forward , sitting down and talking to businesses , figuring out what exactly would help you make more investments that could create more jobs here in the United States , and listening hard to them in a context where maybe Democrats and Republicans are together so we are receiving the same message at the same time and then acting on that agenda could make a big difference . Matt Spetalnick of Reuters . There is a inherent danger in being in the White House and being in the bubble . I mean , folks did not have any complaints about my leadership style when I was running around Iowa for a year . And they got a pretty good look at me up close and personal , and they were able to lift the hood and kick the tires , and I think they understood that my story was theirs . I might have a funny name , I might have lived in some different places , but the values of hard work and responsibility and honesty and looking out for one another that had been instilled in them by their parents , those were the same values that I took from my mom and my grandparents . And so the track record has been that when I am out of this place , that is not an issue . When you are in this place , it is hard not to seem removed . And one of the challenges that we have got to think about is how do I meet my responsibilities here in the White House , which require a lot of hours and a lot of work , but still have that opportunity to engage with the American people on a day to day basis , and know give them confidence that I am listening to them . Those letters that I read every night , some of them just break my heart . Some of them provide me encouragement and inspiration . But nobody is filming me reading those letters . And so it is hard , I think , for people to get a sense of , well , how is he taking in all this information So I think there are more things that we can do to make sure that I am getting out of here . But , I mean , I think it is important to point out as well that a couple of great communicators , Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton , were standing at this podium two years into their presidency getting very similar questions because the economy was not working the way it needed to be and there were a whole range of factors that made people concerned that maybe the party in power was not listening to them . This is something that I think every President needs to go through because the responsibilities of this office are so enormous and so many people are depending on what we do , and in the rush of activity , sometimes we lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place . And that is something that now , I am not recommending for every future President that they take a shellacking like they like I did last night . I am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . But I do think that this is a growth process and an evolution . And the relationship that I have had with the American people is one that built slowly , peaked at this incredible high , and then during the course of the last two years , as we have , together , gone through some very difficult times , has gotten rockier and tougher . And it is going to , I am sure , have some more ups and downs during the course of me being in this office . But the one thing that I just want to end on is getting out of here is good for me , too , because when I travel around the country , even in the toughest of these debates in the midst of health care last year during the summer when there were protesters about , and when I am meeting families who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan or Iraq I always come away from those interactions just feeling so much more optimistic about this country . We have such good and decent people who , on a day to day basis , are finding all kinds of ways to live together and educate kids and grow their communities and improve their communities and create businesses and work together to create great new products and services . The American people always make me optimistic . And that is why , during the course of the last two years , as tough as it is been , as many sometimes scary moments as we have gone through , I have never doubted that we are going to emerge stronger than we were before . And I think that remains true , and I am just going to be looking forward to playing my part in helping that journey along . All right Thank you very much , everybody .Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you so much . Thank you so much . Thank you . Thank you very much , everybody . Thank you . Michelle , I love you so much . A few nights ago , everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am . Malia and Sasha , we are so proud of you . And , yes , you do have to go to school in the morning . And , Joe Biden , thank you for being the very best Vice President I could have ever hoped for , and being a strong and loyal friend . Madam Chairwoman , delegates , I accept your nomination for President of the United States . Now , the first time I addressed this convention in 2004 , I was a younger man , a Senate candidate from Illinois , who spoke about hope not blind optimism , not wishful thinking , but hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward , even when the odds are great , even when the road is long . Eight years later , that hope has been tested by the cost of war , by one of the worst economic crises in history , and by political gridlock that is left us wondering whether it is still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time . I know campaigns can seem small , even silly sometimes . Trivial things become big distractions . Serious issues become sound bites . The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising . If you are sick of hearing me approve this message , believe me , so am But when all is said and done when you pick up that ballot to vote you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation . Over the next few years , big decisions will be made in Washington on jobs , the economy , taxes and deficits , energy , education , war and peace decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and on our children s lives for decades to come . And on every issue , the choice you face will not just be between two candidates or two parties . It will be a choice between two different paths for America , a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future . Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Patton s Army , the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone . They knew they were part of something larger a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression a nation where the most innovative businesses turned out the world s best products . And everyone shared in that pride and success , from the corner office to the factory floor . My grandparents were given the chance to go to college , buy their own home , and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of America s story the promise that hard work will pay off , that responsibility will be rewarded , that everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington , And I ran for President because I saw that basic bargain slipping away . I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas . And by 2008 , we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that did nothe folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition , put gas in the car or food on the table . And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession , millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs , their homes , their life savings a tragedy from which we are still fighting to recover . Now , our friends down in Tampa at the Republican Convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America . But they did not have much to say about how they had make it right . They want your vote , but they do not want you to know their plan . And that is because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions they have had for the last 30 years Have a surplus Try a tax cut . Deficit too high Try another . Feel a cold coming on Take two tax cuts , roll back some regulations and call us in the morning . Now , I have cut taxes for those who need it middle class families , small businesses . But I do not believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores or pay down our deficit . I do not believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy , or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China . After all we have been through , I do not believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small businesswoman expand or the laid off construction worker keep his home . We have been there . We have tried that and we are not going back . We are moving forward , America . Now , I will not pretend the path I am offering is quick or easy . I never have . You did not elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear . You elected me to tell you the truth . And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades . It will require common effort and shared responsibility , and the kind of bold , persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one . And , by the way , those of us who carry on his party s legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington . But know this , America our problems can be solved . Our challenges can be met . The path we offer may be harder , but it leads to a better place . And I am asking you to choose that future . I am asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country goals in manufacturing , energy , education , national security , and the deficit real , achievable plans that will lead to new jobs , more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation . That is what we can do in the next four years and that is why I am running for a second term as President of the United States . We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs . After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed , we are getting back to basics , and doing what America has always done best We are making things again . I have met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared they had never build another American car . And today , they cannot build them fast enough , because we reinvented a dying auto industry that is back on the top of the world . I have worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America not because our workers make less pay , but because we make better products . Because we work harder and smarter than anyone else . I have signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers goods that are stamped with three proud words Made in America . And after a decade of decline , this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years . And now you have a choice We can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here , in the United States of America . We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports , and if we choose this path , we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years . You can make that happen . You can choose that future . You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy . After 30 years of inaction , we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade , cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas . We have doubled our use of renewable energy , and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries . In the last year alone , we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day more than any administration in recent history . And today , the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades . So now you have a choice between a strategy that reverses this progress , or one that builds on it . We have opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years , and we will open more . But unlike my opponent , I will not let oil companies write this country s energy plan , or endanger our coastlines , or collect another 4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers . We are offering a better path . We are offering a better path , where we a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy where we develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that is right beneath our feet . If you choose this path , we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600 , 000 new jobs in natural gas alone . And , yes , my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax . More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke . They are a threat to our children s future . And in this election , you can do something about it . You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete , no matter how old they are or how much money they have . Education was the gateway to opportunity for me . It was the gateway for Michelle . It was the gateway for most of you . And now more than ever , it is the gateway to a middle class life . For the first time in a generation , nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning . Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading . Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders . And now you have a choice we can gut education , or we can decide that in the United States of America , no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school . No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they do not have the money . No company should have to look for workers overseas because they could not find any with the right skills here at home . That is not our future . That is not our future . And government has a role in this . But teachers must inspire principals must lead parents must instill a thirst for learning . And , students , you have got to do the work . And together , I promise you , we can out educate and out compete any nation on Earth . So help me . Help me recruit 100 , 000 math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early childhood education . Help give 2 million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job . Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years . We can meet that goal together . You can choose that future for America . That is our future . In a world of new threats and new challenges , you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven . Four years ago , I promised to end the war in Iraq . We did . I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 . And we have . We have blunted the Taliban s momentum in Afghanistan , and in 2014 , our longest war will be over . A new tower rises above the New York skyline al Qaeda is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead . Tonight , we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm s way . We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected . We will never forget you . And so long as I am Commander in Chief , we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known . When you take off the uniform , we will serve you as well as you have served us because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job , or a roof over their heads , or the care that they need when they come home . Around the world , we have strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons . We have reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers . From Burma to Libya to South Sudan , we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings men and women Christians and Muslims and Jews . But for all the progress that we have made , challenges remain . Terrorist plots must be disrupted . Europe s crisis must be contained . Our commitment to Israel s security must not waver , and neither must our pursuit of peace . The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions . The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists , but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today . So now we have a choice . My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy but from all that we have seen and heard , they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly . After all , you do not call Russia our number one enemy not al Qaeda Russia unless you are still stuck in a Cold War mind warp . You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you cannot visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally . My opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq . And he will not tell us how he will end the war in Afghanistan . Well , I have and I will . And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs do not even want , I will use the money we are no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways . Because after two wars that have cost us thousands of live and over a trillion dollars , it is time to do some nation building right here at home . You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class . Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by 4 trillion . And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion dollars in spending because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it is leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people . I want to reform the tax code so that it is simple , fair , and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over 250 , 000 the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was President the same rate when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs , the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot . Now , I am still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission . No party has a monopoly on wisdom . No democracy works without compromise . I want to get this done , and we can get it done . But when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy , well , what did Bill Clinton call it you do the arithmetic . You do the math . I refuse to go along with that and as long as I am President , I never will . I refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire s tax cut . I refuse to ask students to pay more for college , or kick children out of Head Start programs , or eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled all so those with the most can pay less . I am not going along with that . And I will never I will never turn Medicare into a voucher . No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies . They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned . Yes , we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul , but we will do it by reducing the cost of health care not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more . And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it , not by turning it over to Wall Street . This is the choice we now face . This is what the election comes down to . Over and over , we have been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way that since government cannot do everything , it should do almost nothing . If you cannot afford health insurance , hope that you do not get sick . If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe , well , that is the price of progress . If you cannot afford to start a business or go to college , take my opponent s advice and borrow money from your parents . You know what , that is not who we are . That is not what this country s about . As Americans , we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain , inalienable rights rights that no man or government can take away . We insist on personal responsibility and we celebrate individual initiative . We are not entitled to success we have to earn it . We honor the strivers , the dreamers , the risk takers , the entrepreneurs who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system , the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world s ever known . But we also believe in something called citizenship . Citizenship a word at the very heart of our founding a word at the very essence of our democracy the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations . We believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build , the whole company does better . We believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they cannot afford , that family is protected , but so is the value of other people s homes and so is the entire economy . We believe the little girl who is offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs or the scientist who cures cancer or the President of the United States , and it is in our power to give her that chance . We know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone . We do not want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves and we certainly do not want bailouts for banks that break the rules . We do not think that government can solve all of our problems , but we do not think that government is the source of all of our problems any more than are welfare recipients , or corporations , or unions , or immigrants , or gays , or any other group we are told to blame for our troubles . Because , America , we understand that this democracy is ours . We , the people , recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which asks only what is in it for me , a freedom without commitment to others , a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense . As citizens , we understand that America is not about what can be done for us it is about what can be done by us , together , through the hard and frustrating , but necessary work of self government . That is what we believe . So , you see , the election four years ago was not about me . It was about you . My fellow citizens , you were the change . You are the reason there is a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix who will get the surgery she needs because an insurance company cannot limit her coverage . You did that . You are the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought he had be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance . You made that possible . You are the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she is ever called home why selfless soldiers will not be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely Welcome home . Welcome home . You did that . You did that . You did that . If you turn away now if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for is not possible , well , change will not happen . If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference , then other voices will fill the void the lobbyists and special interests the people with the 10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are making it harder for you to vote Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry , or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves . Only you can make sure that does not happen . Only you have the power to move us forward . I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention . The times have changed , and so have I am no longer just a candidate . I am the President . And that means I know what it means to send young Americans into battle , for I have held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who did not return . I have shared the pain of families who have lost their homes , and the frustration of workers who have lost their jobs . If the critics are right that I have made all my decisions based on polls , then I must not be very good at reading them . And while I am very proud of what we have achieved together , I am far more mindful of my own failings , knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said , I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go . But as I stand here tonight , I have never been more hopeful about America . Not because I think I have all the answers . Not because I am na iuml ve about the magnitude of our challenges . I am hopeful because of you . The young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter she gives me hope . The autoworker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed , but kept coming to work every day , and bought flags for his whole town , and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife he gives me hope . The family business in Warroad , Minnesota , that did not lay off a single one of their 4 , 000 employees when the recession hit , even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants , even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business they give me hope . I think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed hospital , still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee . Six months ago , we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iraq , tall and 20 pounds heavier , dashing in his uniform , with a big grin on his face , sturdy on his new leg . And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle , racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day , inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled he gives me hope . He gives me hope . I do not know what party these men and women belong to . I do not know if they will vote for me . But I know that their spirit defines us . They remind me , in the words of Scripture , that ours is a future filled with hope . And if you share that faith with me if you share that hope with me I ask you tonight for your vote . If you reject the notion that this nation s promise is reserved for the few , your voice must be heard in this election . If you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder , you need to stand up in this election . If you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape , that new energy can power our future , that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot , and everyone does their fair share , and everyone plays by the same rules then I need you to vote this November . America , I never said this journey would be easy , and I will not promise that now . Yes , our path is harder , but it leads to a better place . Yes , our road is longer , but we travel it together . We do not turn back . We leave no one behind . We pull each other up . We draw strength from our victories , and we learn from our mistakes , but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon , knowing that Providence is with us , and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless these United States .Mr . Speaker , Mr . Vice President , members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow Americans Last month , I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq . Together , we offered a final , proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand gave their lives . We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world . For the first time in nine years , there are no Americans fighting in Iraq . For the first time in two decades , Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country . Most of al Qaeda s top lieutenants have been defeated . The Taliban s momentum has been broken , and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home . These achievements are a testament to the courage , selflessness and teamwork of America s Armed Forces . At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down , they exceed all expectations . They are not consumed with personal ambition . They do not obsess over their differences . They focus on the mission at hand . They work together . Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example . Think about the America within our reach A country that leads the world in educating its people . An America that attracts a new generation of high tech manufacturing and high paying jobs . A future where we are in control of our own energy , and our security and prosperity are not so tied to unstable parts of the world . An economy built to last , where hard work pays off , and responsibility is rewarded . We can do this . I know we can , because we have done it before . At the end of World War Iwhen another generation of heroes returned home from combat , they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known . My grandfather , a veteran of Patton s Army , got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill . My grandmother , who worked on a bomber assembly line , was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth . The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism . They understood they were part of something larger that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share the basic American promise that if you worked hard , you could do well enough to raise a family , own a home , send your kids to college , and put a little away for retirement . The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive . No challenge is more urgent . No debate is more important . We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by , or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot , and everyone does their fair share , and everyone plays by the same set of rules . What is at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values , but American values . And we have to reclaim them . Let us remember how we got here . Long before the recession , jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores . Technology made businesses more efficient , but also made some jobs obsolete . Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before , but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing , paychecks that were not , and personal debt that kept piling up . In 2008 , the house of cards collapsed . We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who could not afford or understand them . Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people s money . Regulators had looked the other way , or did not have the authority to stop the bad behavior . It was wrong . It was irresponsible . And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work , saddled us with more debt , and left innocent , hardworking Americans holding the bag . In the six months before I took office , we lost nearly 4 million jobs . And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect . Those are the facts . But so are these In the last 22 months , businesses have created more than 3 million jobs . Last year , they created the most jobs since 2005 . American manufacturers are hiring again , creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s . Together , we have agreed to cut the deficit by more than 2 trillion . And we have put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable , so a crisis like this never happens again . The state of our Union is getting stronger . And we have come too far to turn back now . As long as I am President , I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum . But I intend to fight obstruction with action , and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place . No , we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing , bad debt , and phony financial profits . Tonight , I want to speak about how we move forward , and lay out a blueprint for an economy that is built to last an economy built on American manufacturing , American energy , skills for American workers , and a renewal of American values . Now , this blueprint begins with American manufacturing . On the day I took office , our auto industry was on the verge of collapse . Some even said we should let it die . With a million jobs at stake , I refused to let that happen . In exchange for help , we demanded responsibility . We got workers and automakers to settle their differences . We got the industry to retool and restructure . Today , General Motors is back on top as the world s number one automaker . Chrysler has grown faster in the than any major car company . Ford is investing billions in plants and factories . And together , the entire industry added nearly 160 , 000 jobs . We bet on American workers . We bet on American ingenuity . And tonight , the American auto industry is back . What is happening in Detroit can happen in other industries . It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh . We cannot bring every job back that is left our shore . But right now , it is getting more expensive to do business in places like China . Meanwhile , America is more productive . A few weeks ago , the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home . Today , for the first time in 15 years , Master Lock s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity . So we have a huge opportunity , at this moment , to bring manufacturing back . But we have to seize it . Tonight , my message to business leaders is simple Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country , and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed . We should start with our tax code . Right now , companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas . Meanwhile , companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world . It makes no sense , and everyone knows it . So let us change it . First , if you are a business that wants to outsource jobs , you should not get a tax deduction for doing it . That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home . Second , no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas . From now on , every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax . And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America . Third , if you are an American manufacturer , you should get a bigger tax cut . If you are a high tech manufacturer , we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here . And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town , you should get help financing a new plant , equipment , or training for new workers . So my message is simple . It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas , and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America . Send me these tax reforms , and I will sign them right away . We are also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world . Two years ago , I set a goal of doubling exports over five years . With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law , we are on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule . And soon , there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama , Colombia , and South Korea . Soon , there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit , and Toledo , and Chicago . I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products . And I will not stand by when our competitors do not play by the rules . We have brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration and it is made a difference . Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires . But we need to do more . It is not right when another country lets our movies , music , and software be pirated . It is not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they are heavily subsidized . Tonight , I am announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China . There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders . And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia . Our workers are the most productive on Earth , and if the playing field is level , I promise you America will always win . I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but cannot find workers with the right skills . Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job . Think about that openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work . It is inexcusable . And we know how to fix it . Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic . Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte , and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College . The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training . It paid Jackie s tuition , then hired her to help operate their plant . I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did . Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job . My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help . Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte , and Orlando , and Louisville are up and running . Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now , from data management to high tech manufacturing . And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs , so that from now on , people like Jackie have one program , one website , and one place to go for all the information and help that they need . It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work . These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today . But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow , our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier . For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year , we have convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning the first time that is happened in a generation . But challenges remain . And we know how to solve them . At a time when other countries are doubling down on education , tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers . We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over 250 , 000 . A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance . Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives . Most teachers work tirelessly , with modest pay , sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies just to make a difference . Teachers matter . So instead of bashing them , or defending the status quo , let us offer schools a deal . Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job , and reward the best ones . And in return , grant schools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion to stop teaching to the test and to replace teachers who just are not helping kids learn . That is a bargain worth making . We also know that when students do not walk away from their education , more of them walk the stage to get their diploma . When students are not allowed to drop out , they do better . So tonight , I am proposing that every state every state requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18 . When kids do graduate , the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college . At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt , this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July . Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle class families thousands of dollars , and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work study jobs in the next five years . Of course , it is not enough for us to increase student aid . We cannot just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition we will run out of money . States also need to do their part , by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets . And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down . Recently , I spoke with a group of college presidents who have done just that . Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly . Some use better technology . The point is , it is possible . So let me put colleges and universities on notice If you cannot stop tuition from going up , the funding you get from taxpayers will go down . Higher education cannot be a luxury it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford . Let us also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented , hardworking students in this country face another challenge the fact that they are not yet American citizens . Many were brought here as small children , are American through and through , yet they live every day with the threat of deportation . Others came more recently , to study business and science and engineering , but as soon as they get their degree , we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else . That does not make sense . I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration . That is why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before . That is why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office . The opponents of action are out of excuses . We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now . But if election year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan , let us at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs , start new businesses , defend this country . Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship . I will sign it right away . You see , an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country . That means women should earn equal pay for equal work . It means we should support everyone who is willing to work , and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs . After all , innovation is what America has always been about . Most new jobs are created in start ups and small businesses . So let us pass an agenda that helps them succeed . Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow . Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs . Both parties agree on these ideas . So put them in a bill , and get it on my desk this year . Innovation also demands basic research . Today , the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched . New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet . Do not gut these investments in our budget . Do not let other countries win the race for the future . Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet to new American jobs and new American industries . And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American made energy . Over the last three years , we have opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration , and tonight , I am directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources . Right now right now American oil production is the highest that it is been in eight years . That is right eight years . Not only that last year , we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years . But with only 2 percent of the world s oil reserves , oil is not enough . This country needs an all out , all of the above strategy that develops every available source of American energy . A strategy that is cleaner , cheaper , and full of new jobs . We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years . And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy . Experts believe this will support more than 600 , 000 jobs by the end of the decade . And I am requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use . Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk . The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper , proving that we do not have to choose between our environment and our economy . And by the way , it was public research dollars , over the course of 30 years , that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground . Now , what is true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy . In three years , our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world s leading manufacturer of high tech batteries . Because of federal investments , renewable energy use has nearly doubled , and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it . When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture , he said he worried that at 55 , no one would give him a second chance . But he found work at Energetx , a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan . Before the recession , the factory only made luxury yachts . Today , it is hiring workers like Bryan , who said , I am proud to be working in the industry of the future . Our experience with shale gas , our experience with natural gas , shows us that the payoffs on these public investments do not always come right away . Some technologies do not pan out some companies fail . But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy . I will not walk away from workers like Bryan . I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here . We have subsidized oil companies for a century . That is long enough . It is time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable , and double down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising . Pass clean energy tax credits . Create these jobs . We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives . The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change . But there is no reason why Congress should not at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation . So far , you have not acted . Well , tonight , I will . I am directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes . And I am proud to announce that the Department of Defense , working with us , the world s largest consumer of energy , will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year . Of course , the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy . So here s a proposal Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings . Their energy bills will be 100 billion lower over the next decade , and America will have less pollution , more manufacturing , more jobs for construction workers who need them . Send me a bill that creates these jobs . Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America s infrastructure . So much of America needs to be rebuilt . We have got crumbling roads and bridges a power grid that wastes too much energy an incomplete high speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world . During the Great Depression , America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge . After World War Iwe connected our states with a system of highways . Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody , from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today . In the next few weeks , I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects . But you need to fund these projects . Take the money we are no longer spending at war , use half of it to pay down our debt , and use the rest to do some nation building right here at home . There is never been a better time to build , especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst . Of course , construction workers were not the only ones who were hurt . So were millions of innocent Americans who have seen their home values decline . And while government cannot fix the problem on its own , responsible homeowners should not have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief . And that is why I am sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about 3 , 000 a year on their mortgage , by refinancing at historically low rates . No more red tape . No more runaround from the banks . A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it will not add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust . Let us never forget Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same . It is time to apply the same rules from top to bottom . No bailouts , no handouts , and no copouts . An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody . We have all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who could not afford them , and buyers who knew they could not afford them . That is why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior . Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices these do not destroy the free market . They make the free market work better . There is no question that some regulations are outdated , unnecessary , or too costly . In fact , I have approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his . I have ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that do not make sense . We have already announced over 500 reforms , and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion over the next five years . We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend 10 , 000 a year proving that they could contain a spill because milk was somehow classified as an oil . With a rule like that , I guess it was worth crying overspilled milk . Now , I am confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder . Absolutely . But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago . I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning , or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean . I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy , deny your coverage , or charge women differently than men . And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules . The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system s core purpose Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas , and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home , or start a business , or send their kids to college . So if you are a big bank or financial institution , you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers deposits . You are required to write out a living will that details exactly how you will pay the bills if you fail because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again . And if you are a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company , the days of signing people up for products they cannot afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices those days are over . Today , American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job To look out for them . We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large scale fraud and protect people s investments . Some financial firms violate major anti fraud laws because there is no real penalty for being a repeat offender . That is bad for consumers , and it is bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing . So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count . And tonight , I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis . This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law , speed assistance to homeowners , and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans . Now , a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy . But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future . Right now , our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile . People cannot afford losing 40 out of each paycheck this year . There are plenty of ways to get this done . So let us agree right here , right now No side issues . No drama . Pass the payroll tax cut without delay . Let us get it done . When it comes to the deficit , we have already agreed to more than 2 trillion in cuts and savings . But we need to do more , and that means making choices . Right now , we are poised to spend nearly 1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans . Right now , because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code , a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households . Right now , Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary . Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else like education and medical research a strong military and care for our veterans Because if we are serious about paying down our debt , we cannot do both . The American people know what the right choice is . So do As I told the Speaker this summer , I am prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid , and strengthen Social Security , so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors . But in return , we need to change our tax code so that people like me , and an awful lot of members of Congress , pay our fair share of taxes . Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule . If you make more than 1 million a year , you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes . And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires . In fact , if you are earning a million dollars a year , you should not get special tax subsidies or deductions . On the other hand , if you make under 250 , 000 a year , like 98 percent of American families , your taxes should not go up . You are the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages . You are the ones who need relief . Now , you can call this class warfare all you want . But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes Most Americans would call that common sense . We do not begrudge financial success in this country . We admire it . When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes , it is not because they envy the rich . It is because they understand that when I get a tax break I do not need and the country cannot afford , it either adds to the deficit , or somebody else has to make up the difference like a senior on a fixed income , or a student trying to get through school , or a family trying to make ends meet . That is not right . Americans know that is not right . They know that this generation s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other , and to the future of their country , and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility . That is how we will reduce our deficit . That is an America built to last . Now , I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt , energy and health care . But no matter what party they belong to , I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now Nothing will get done in Washington this year , or next year , or maybe even the year after that , because Washington is broken . Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year did not come from events beyond our control . It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not . Who benefited from that fiasco I have talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street . But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad and it seems to get worse every year . Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics . So together , let us take some steps to fix that . Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress I will sign it tomorrow . Let us limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact . Let us make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress cannot lobby Congress , and vice versa an idea that has bipartisan support , at least outside of Washington . Some of what is broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days . A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything even routine business passed through the Senate . Neither party has been blameless in these tactics . Now both parties should put an end to it . For starters , I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days . The executive branch also needs to change . Too often , it is inefficient , outdated and remote . That is why I have asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy , so that our government is leaner , quicker , and more responsive to the needs of the American people . Finally , none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town . We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas . I am a Democrat . But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves , and no more . That is why my education reform offers more competition , and more control for schools and states . That is why we are getting rid of regulations that do not work . That is why our health care law relies on a reformed private market , not a government program . On the other hand , even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads , and clean energy projects , and federal offices for the folks back home . The point is , we should all want a smarter , more effective government . And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year , we can make real progress . With or without this Congress , I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow . But I can do a whole lot more with your help . Because when we act together , there is nothing the United States of America cannot achieve . That is the lesson we have learned from our actions abroad over the last few years . Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies . From Pakistan to Yemen , the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling , knowing that they cannot escape the reach of the United States of America . From this position of strength , we have begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan . Ten thousand of our troops have come home . Twenty three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer . This transition to Afghan lead will continue , and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan , so that it is never again a source of attacks against America . As the tide of war recedes , a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa , from Tunis to Cairo from Sana a to Tripoli . A year ago , Qaddafi was one of the world s longest serving dictators a murderer with American blood on his hands . Today , he is gone . And in Syria , I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed , and that human dignity cannot be denied . How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain . But we have a huge stake in the outcome . And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate , we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well . We will stand against violence and intimidation . We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings men and women Christians , Muslims and Jews . We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets , because tyranny is no match for liberty . And we will safeguard America s own security against those who threaten our citizens , our friends , and our interests . Look at Iran . Through the power of our diplomacy , a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran s nuclear program now stands as one . The regime is more isolated than ever before its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions , and as long as they shirk their responsibilities , this pressure will not relent . Let there be no doubt America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon , and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal . But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible , and far better , and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations , it can rejoin the community of nations . The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe . Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever . Our ties to the Americas are deeper . Our ironclad commitment and I mean ironclad to Israel s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history . We have made it clear that America is a Pacific power , and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope . From the coalitions we have built to secure nuclear materials , to the missions we have led against hunger and disease from the blows we have dealt to our enemies , to the enduring power of our moral example , America is back . Anyone who tells you otherwise , anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned , does not know what they are talking about . That is not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us . That is not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin , from Cape Town to Rio , where opinions of America are higher than they have been in years . Yes , the world is changing . No , we cannot control every event . But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs and as long as I am President , I intend to keep it that way . That is why , working with our military leaders , I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world , while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget . To stay one step ahead of our adversaries , I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber threats . Above all , our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it . As they come home , we must serve them as well as they have served us . That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned which is why we have increased annual VA spending every year I have been President . And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation . With the bipartisan support of this Congress , we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets . Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of135 , 000 jobs for veterans and their families . And tonight , I am proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters , so that America is as strong as those who defend her . Which brings me back to where I began . Those of us who have been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops . When you put on that uniform , it does not matter if you are black or white Asian , Latino , Native American conservative , liberal rich , poor gay , straight . When you are marching into battle , you look out for the person next to you , or the mission fails . When you are in the thick of the fight , you rise or fall as one unit , serving one nation , leaving no one behind . One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden . On it are each of their names . Some may be Democrats . Some may be Republicans . But that does not matter . Just like it did not matter that day in the Situation Room , when I sat next to Bob Gates a man who was George Bush s defense secretary and Hillary Clinton a woman who ran against me for president . All that mattered that day was the mission . No one thought about politics . No one thought about themselves . One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he did not deserve credit for the mission . It only succeeded , he said , because every single member of that unit did their job the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control the translator who kept others from entering the compound the troops who separated the women and children from the fight the SEALs who charged up the stairs . More than that , the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other because you cannot charge up those stairs , into darkness and danger , unless you know that there is somebody behind you , watching your back . So it is with America . Each time I look at that flag , I am reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes . No one built this country on their own . This nation is great because we built it together . This nation is great because we worked as a team . This nation is great because we get each other s backs . And if we hold fast to that truth , in this moment of trial , there is no challenge too great no mission too hard . As long as we are joined in common purpose , as long as we maintain our common resolve , our journey moves forward , and our future is hopeful , and the state of our Union will always be strong . Thank you , God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .Vice President Biden , Mr . Chief Justice , members of the United States Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution . We affirm the promise of our democracy . We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names . What makes us exceptional what makes us American is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Today we continue a never ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time . For history tells us that while these truths may be self evident , they have never been self executing that while freedom is a gift from God , it must be secured by His people here on Earth . The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob . They gave to us a republic , a government of , and by , and for the people , entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed . And for more than two hundred years , we have . Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword , we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half slave and half free . We made ourselves anew , and vowed to move forward together . Together , we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce , schools and colleges to train our workers . Together , we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play . Together , we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable , and protect its people from life s worst hazards and misfortune . Through it all , we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority , nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society s ills can be cured through government alone . Our celebration of initiative and enterprise , our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility , these are constants in our character . But we have always understood that when times change , so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action . For the American people can no more meet the demands of today s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias . No single person can train all the math and science teachers we will need to equip our children for the future , or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores . Now , more than ever , we must do these things together , as one nation and one people . This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience . A decade of war is now ending . An economic recovery has begun . America s possibilities are limitless , for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands youth and drive diversity and openness an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention . My fellow Americans , we are made for this moment , and we will seize it so long as we seize it together . For we , the people , understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it . We believe that America s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class . We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship . We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else , because she is an American she is free , and she is equal , not just in the eyes of God but also in our own . We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time . So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government , revamp our tax code , reform our schools , and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder , learn more , reach higher . But while the means will change , our purpose endures a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American . That is what this moment requires . That is what will give real meaning to our creed . We , the people , still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity . We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit . But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future . For we remember the lessons of our past , when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn . We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky , or happiness for the few . We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives , any one of us at any time may face a job loss , or a sudden illness , or a home swept away in a terrible storm . The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security , these things do not sap our initiative , they strengthen us . They do not make us a nation of takers they free us to take the risks that make this country great . We , the people , still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves , but to all posterity . We will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations . Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science , but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms . The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult . But America cannot resist this transition , we must lead it . We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries , we must claim its promise . That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure our forests and waterways , our crop lands and snow capped peaks . That is how we will preserve our planet , commanded to our care by God . That is what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared . We , the people , still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war . Our brave men and women in uniform , tempered by the flames of battle , are unmatched in skill and courage . Our citizens , seared by the memory of those we have lost , know too well the price that is paid for liberty . The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm . But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends and we must carry those lessons into this time as well . We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law . We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully not because we are na iuml ve about the dangers we face , but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear . America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe . And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad , for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation . We will support democracy from Asia to Africa , from the Americas to the Middle East , because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom . And we must be a source of hope to the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the victims of prejudice not out of mere charity , but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes tolerance and opportunity , human dignity and justice . We , the people , declare today that the most evident of truths that all of us are created equal is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls , and Selma , and Stonewall just as it guided all those men and women , sung and unsung , who left footprints along this great Mall , to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth . It is now our generation s task to carry on what those pioneers began . For our journey is not complete until our wives , our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts . Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well . Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote . Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country . Our journey is not complete until all our children , from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia , to the quiet lanes of Newtown , know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm . That is our generation s task to make these words , these rights , these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American . Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life . It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness . Progress does not compel us to settle centuries long debates about the role of government for all time , but it does require us to act in our time . For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay . We cannot mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name calling as reasoned debate . We must act , knowing that our work will be imperfect . We must act , knowing that today s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall . My fellow Americans , the oath I have sworn before you today , like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol , was an oath to God and country , not party or faction . And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service . But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream . My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride . They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope . You and as citizens , have the power to set this country s course . You and as citizens , have the obligation to shape the debates of our time not only with the votes we cast , but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals . Let us , each of us , now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright . With common effort and common purpose , with passion and dedication , let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom . Thank you . God bless you , and may He forever bless these United States of America .Thank you Thank you Thank you so much . It is good to be back in Las Vegas And it is good to be among so many good friends . Let me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us . Go Dragons Let me especially thank your outstanding principal , Lisa Primas . There are all kinds of notable guests here , but I just want to mention a few . First of all , our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , Janet Napolitano , is here . Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar . Former Secretary of Labor , Hilda Solis . Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada , Steve Horsford and Dina Titus . Your own mayor , Carolyn Goodman . But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue we are going to talk about today is . Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale , Arizona . Kasim Reed from Atlanta , Georgia . Greg Stanton from Phoenix , Arizona . And Ashley Swearengin from Fresno , California . And all of you are here , as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country . And we are just so grateful . Some outstanding business leaders are here as well . And of course , we have got wonderful students here , so I could not be prouder of our students . Now , those of you have a seat , feel free to take a seat . I do not mind . I love you back . Now , last week , I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as President of the United States . And during my inaugural address , I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time does not require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have , but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose . It requires us to act . I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others . Some debates will be more contentious . That is to be expected . But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling where a broad consensus is emerging and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America . I am here today because the time has come for common sense , comprehensive immigration reform . The time is now . Now is the time . Now is the time . Now is the time . Now is the time . I am here because most Americans agree that it is time to fix a system that is been broken for way too long . I am here because business leaders , faith leaders , labor leaders , law enforcement , and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity . Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country s future . Think about it we define ourselves as a nation of immigrants . That is who we are in our bones . The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe , that is always been one of our greatest strengths . It keeps our workforce young . It keeps our country on the cutting edge . And it is helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known . After all , immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo . They created entire new industries that , in turn , created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens . In recent years , one in four high tech startups in America were founded by immigrants . One in four new small business owners were immigrants , including right here in Nevada folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans . But we all know that today , we have an immigration system that is out of date and badly broken a system that is holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class . Right now , we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows . Yes , they broke the rules . They crossed the border illegally . Maybe they overstayed their visas . Those are facts . Nobody disputes them . But these 11 million men and women are now here . Many of them have been here for years . And the overwhelming majority of these individuals are not looking for any trouble . They are contributing members of the community . They are looking out for their families . They are looking out for their neighbors . They are woven into the fabric of our lives . Every day , like the rest of us , they go out and try to earn a living . Often they do that in a shadow economy a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay . And when that happens , it is not just bad for them , it is bad for the entire economy . Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing that are hiring people legally , paying a decent wage , following the rules they are the ones who suffer . They have got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules . And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened , too . So if we are truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class , we have got to fix the system . We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules . We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable businesses for who they hire , and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law . That is common sense . And that is why we need comprehensive immigration reform . There is another economic reason why we need reform . It is not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy . It is also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so , and the effect that has on our economy . Right now , there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities . They are earning degrees in the fields of the future , like engineering and computer science . But once they finish school , once they earn that diploma , there is a good chance they will have to leave our country . Think about that . Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here . Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here . Right now in one of those classrooms , there is a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea their Intel or Instagram into a big business . We are giving them all the skills they need to figure that out , but then we are going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else That is not how you grow new industries in America . That is how you give new industries to our competitors . That is why we need comprehensive immigration reform . Now , during my first term , we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system . First , we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants . We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history . And today , illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000 . Second , we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities . And today , deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever . And third , we took up the cause of the DREAMers the young people who were brought to this country as children , young people who have grown up here , built their lives here , have futures here . We said that if you are able to meet some basic criteria like pursuing an education , then we will consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally , so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong . But because this change is not permanent , we need Congress to act and not just on the DREAM Act . We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now . That is what we need . Now , the good news is that for the first time in many years , Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together . Members of both parties , in both chambers , are actively working on a solution . Yesterday , a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform , which are very much in line with the principles I have proposed and campaigned on for the last few years . So at this moment , it looks like there is a genuine desire to get this done soon , and that is very encouraging . But this time , action must follow . We cannot allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate . We have been debating this a very long time . So it is not as if we do not know technically what needs to get done . As a consequence , to help move this process along , today I am laying out my ideas for immigration reform . And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill , because the ideas I am proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George Bush . You do not get that matchup very often . So we know where the consensus should be . Now , of course , there will be rigorous debate about many of the details , and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process . But it is important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place . And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion , I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away . So the principles are pretty straightforward . There are a lot of details behind it . We are going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we are talking about . But the principles are pretty straightforward . First , I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement . That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders . It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers . To be fair , most businesses want to do the right thing , but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who is here legally , who is not . So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone s employment status . And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers , then we need to ramp up the penalties . Second , we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally . We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship . But for comprehensive immigration reform to work , it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship . We have got to lay out a path a process that includes passing a background check , paying taxes , paying a penalty , learning English , and then going to the back of the line , behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally . That is only fair , right So that means it will not be a quick process but it will be a fair process . And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship . And the third principle is we have got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time . For example , if you are a citizen , you should not have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America . You should not have to wait years . If you are a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology , or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors , we should help you do that here . Because if you succeed , you will create American businesses and American jobs . You will help us grow our economy . You will help us strengthen our middle class . So that is what comprehensive immigration reform looks like smarter enforcement a pathway to earned citizenship improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world . It is pretty straightforward . The question now is simple Do we have the resolve as a people , as a country , as a government to finally put this issue behind us I believe that we do . I believe that we do . I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp . But I promise you this The closer we get , the more emotional this debate is going to become . Immigration has always been an issue that enflames passions . That is not surprising . There are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the United States of America . That is a big deal . When we talk about that in the abstract , it is easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of us versus them . And when that happens , a lot of folks forget that most of us used to be them . We forget that . It is really important for us to remember our history . Unless you are one of the first Americans , a Native American , you came from someplace else . Somebody brought you . Ken Salazar , he is of Mexican American descent , but he points that his family has been living where he lives for 400 years , so he did not immigrate anywhere . The Irish who left behind a land of famine . The Germans who fled persecution . The Scandinavians who arrived eager to pioneer out west . The Polish . The Russians . The Italians . The Chinese . The Japanese . The West Indians . The huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other . All those folks , before they were us , they were them . And when each new wave of immigrants arrived , they faced resistance from those who were already here . They faced hardship . They faced racism . They faced ridicule . But over time , as they went about their daily lives , as they earned a living , as they raised a family , as they built a community , as their kids went to school here , they did their part to build a nation . They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies . But they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember , but whose actions helped make us who we are who built this country hand by hand , brick by brick . They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth , but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story . And that is still true today . Just ask Alan Aleman . Alan is here this afternoon where is Alan He is around here there he is right here . Alan was born in Mexico . He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child . Growing up , Alan went to an American school , pledged allegiance to the American flag , felt American in every way and he was , except for one on paper . In high school , Alan watched his friends come of age driving around town with their new licenses , earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall . He knew he could not do those things . But it did not matter that much . What mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God given potential . Last year , when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows even if it is just for two years at a time he was one of the first to sign up . And a few months ago he was one of the first people in Nevada to get approved . In that moment , Alan said , I felt the fear vanish . I felt accepted . So today , Alan is in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada . Alan is studying to become a doctor . He hopes to join the Air Force . He is working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family . And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America . So in the coming weeks , as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated , and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart , remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams . Remember that this is not just a debate about policy . It is about people . It is about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story . Throughout our history , that has only made our nation stronger . And it is how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last an American century welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more , and who is willing to work hard to do it , and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless the United States of America .Good morning , everybody . As you know , I just met with leaders of both parties to discuss a way forward in light of the severe budget cuts that start to take effect today . I told them these cuts will hurt our economy . They will cost us jobs . And to set it right , both sides need to be willing to compromise . The good news is the American people are strong and they are resilient . They fought hard to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , and we will get through this as well . Even with these cuts in place , folks all across this country will work hard to make sure that we keep the recovery going . But Washington sure is not making it easy . At a time when our businesses have finally begun to get some traction hiring new workers , bringing jobs back to America we should not be making a series of dumb , arbitrary cuts to things that businesses depend on and workers depend on , like education , and research , and infrastructure and defense . It is unnecessary . And at a time when too many Americans are still looking for work , it is inexcusable . Now , what is important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away . The pain , though , will be real . Beginning this week , many middle class families will have their lives disrupted in significant ways . Businesses that work with the military , like the Virginia shipbuilder that I visited on Tuesday , may have to lay folks off . Communities near military bases will take a serious blow . Hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country Border Patrol agents , FBI agents , civilians who work at the Pentagon all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs . All of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy . Layoffs and pay cuts means that people have less money in their pockets , and that means that they have less money to spend at local businesses . That means lower profits . That means fewer hires . The longer these cuts remain in place , the greater the damage to our economy a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day . So economists are estimating that as a consequence of this sequester , that we could see growth cut by over one half of 1 percent . It will cost about 750 , 000 jobs at a time when we should be growing jobs more quickly . So every time that we get a piece of economic news , over the next month , next two months , next six months , as long as the sequester is in place , we will know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act . And let us be clear . None of this is necessary . It is happening because of a choice that Republicans in Congress have made . They have allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit . As recently as yesterday , they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well off and well connected , and they think that that is apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts . I do believe that we can and must replace these cuts with a more balanced approach that asks something from everybody Smart spending cuts entitlement reform tax reform that makes the tax code more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates all so that we can responsibly lower the deficit without laying off workers , or forcing parents to scramble for childcare , or slashing financial aid for college students . I do not think that is too much to ask . I do not think that is partisan . It is the kind of approach that I have proposed for two years . It is what I ran on last year . And the majority of the American people agree with me in this approach , including , by the way , a majority of Republicans . We just need Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own party and their country on this . And if they did so , we could make a lot of progress . I do know that there are Republicans in Congress who privately , at least , say that they would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through . I know that there are Democrats who d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts go through . So there is a caucus of common sense up on Capitol Hill . It is just it is a silent group right now , and we want to make sure that their voices start getting heard . In the coming days and in the coming weeks I am going to keep on reaching out to them , both individually and as groups of senators or members of the House , and say to them , let us fix this not just for a month or two , but for years to come . Because the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in month to month increments , or by careening from crisis to crisis . And America has got a lot more work to do . In the meantime , we cannot let political gridlock around the budget stand in the way of other areas where we can make progress . I was pleased to see that the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday . That is a big win for not just women but for families and for the American people . It is a law that is going to save lives and help more Americans live free from fear . It is something that we have been pushing on for a long time . I was glad to see that done . And it is an example of how we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress even though there is still these fiscal arguments taking place . And I think there are other areas where we can make progress even with the sequester unresolved . I will continue to push for those initiatives . I am going to keep pushing for high quality preschool for every family that wants it . I am going to keep pushing to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that it is one that families can live on . I am going to keep on pushing for immigration reform , and reform our voting system , and improvements on our transportation sector . And I am going to keep pushing for sensible gun reforms because I still think they deserve a vote . This is the agenda that the American people voted for . These are America s priorities . They are too important to go unaddressed . And I am going to keep pushing to make sure that we see them through . So with that , I am going to take some questions . I am going to start with Julie . Look , we have already cut 2 . 5 trillion in our deficit . Everybody says we need to cut 4 trillion , which means we have to come up with another trillion and a half . The vast majority of economists agree that the problem when it comes to deficits is not discretionary spending . It is not that we are spending too much money on education . It is not that we are spending too much money on job training , or that we are spending too much money rebuilding our roads and our bridges . We are not . The problem that we have is a long term problem in terms of our health care costs and programs like Medicare . And what I have said very specifically , very detailed is that I am prepared to take on the problem where it exists on entitlements and do some things that my own party really does not like if it is part of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction . So the deal that I have put forward over the last two years , the deal that I put forward as recently as December is still on the table . I am prepared to do hard things and to push my Democratic friends to do hard things . But what I cannot do is ask middle class families , ask seniors , ask students to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when we know we have got a bunch of tax loopholes that are benefiting the well off and the well connected , are not contributing to growth , are not contributing to our economy . It is not fair . It is not right . The American people do not think it is fair and do not think it is right . So I recognize that Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his caucus . I recognize that it is very hard for Republican leaders to be perceived as making concessions to me . Sometimes , I reflect is there something else I could do to make these guys I am not talking about the leaders now , but maybe some of the House Republican caucus members not paint horns on my head . And I genuinely believe that there is an opportunity for us to cooperate . But what does not make sense and the only thing that we have seen from Republicans so far in terms of proposals is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts . That is not going to help the economy . That is not going to help growth . That is not going to create jobs . And as a number of economists have noted , ironically , it does not even reduce our deficit in the smartest way possible or the fastest way possible . So in terms of going forward , my hope is that after some reflection as members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted , as we start seeing the impact that the sequester is having that they step back and say , all right , is there a way for us to move forward on a package of entitlement reforms , tax reform , not raising tax rates , identifying programs that do not work , coming up with a plan that is comprehensive and that makes sense . And it may take a couple of weeks . It may take a couple of months , but I am just going to keep on pushing on it . And my view is that , ultimately , common sense prevails . But what is true right now is that the Republicans have made a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we will not accept an extra dime s worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to get any larger comprehensive deal . And that is a choice they are making . They are saying that it is more important to preserve these tax loopholes than it is to prevent these arbitrary cuts . And what is interesting is Speaker Boehner , just a couple months ago , identified these tax loopholes and tax breaks and said we should close them and raise revenue . So it is not as if it is not possible to do . They themselves have suggested that it is possible to do . And if they believe that in fact these tax loopholes and these tax breaks for the well off and the well connected are not contributing to growth , are not good for our economy , are not particularly fair and can raise revenue , well , why do not we get started Why do not we do that It may be that because of the politics within the Republican Party , they cannot do it right now . I understand that . My hope is , is that they can do it later . And I just want to repeat , Julie , because I think it is very important to understand , it is not as if Democrats are not being asked to do anything , either , to compromise . There are members of my party who violently disagree with the notion that we should do anything on Medicare . And I am willing to say to them , I disagree with you , because I want to preserve Medicare for the long haul . And we are going to have some tough politics within my party to get this done . This is not a situation where I am only asking for concessions from Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats . I am saying that everybody is going to have to do something . And the one key to this whole thing is trying to make sure we keep in mind who we are here for . We are not here for ourselves , we are not here for our parties , we are not here to advance our electoral prospects . We are here for American families who have been getting battered pretty good over the last four years , are just starting to see the economy improve businesses are just starting to see some confidence coming back . And this is not a win for anybody , this is a loss for the American people . And , again , if we step back and just remind ourselves what it is we are supposed to be doing here , then hopefully common sense will out in the end . Well , Julie , give me an example of what I might do . Well , no , but I am trying to clarify the question . What I am suggesting is , I have put forward a plan that calls for serious spending cuts , serious entitlement reforms , goes right at the problem that is at the heart of our long term deficit problem . I have offered negotiations around that kind of balanced approach . And so far , we have gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have said is , we cannot do any revenue , we cannot do a dime s worth of revenue . So what more do you think I should do Okay , I just wanted to clarify . Because if people have a suggestion , I am happy to this is a room full of smart folks . All right Zach Goldfarb . Well , I had like to think I have still got some persuasive power left . Let me check . Look , the issue is not my persuasive power . The American people agree with my approach . They agree that we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction . The question is can the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do the right thing , and I have a lot of confidence that over time , if the American people express their displeasure about how something is working , that eventually Congress responds . Sometimes there is a little gap between what the American people think and what Congress thinks . But eventually Congress catches up . With respect to the budget and keeping the government open I will try for our viewing audience to make sure that we are not talking in Washington gobbledygook . What is called the continuing resolution , which is essentially just an extension of last year s budget into this year s budget to make sure that basic government functions continue , I think it is the right thing to do to make sure that we do not have a government shutdown . And that is preventable . We have a Budget Control Act , right We agreed to a certain amount of money that was going to be spent each year , and certain funding levels for our military , our education system , and so forth . If we stick to that deal , then I will be supportive of us sticking to that deal . It is a deal that I made . The sequester are additional cuts on top of that . And by law , until Congress takes the sequester away , we had have to abide by those additional cuts . But there is no reason why we should have another crisis by shutting the government down in addition to these arbitrary spending cuts . Zach , I am not going to I never want to make myself 100 percent clear with you guys . But I think it is fair to say that I made a deal for a certain budget , certain numbers . There is no reason why that deal needs to be reopened . It was a deal that Speaker Boehner made as well , and all the leadership made . And if the bill that arrives on my desk is reflective of the commitments that we have previously made , then obviously I would sign it because I want to make sure that we keep on doing what we need to do for the American people . Jessica . I mean , Jessica , I am not a dictator . I am the President . So , ultimately , if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say , we need to go to catch a plane , I cannot have Secret Service block the doorway , right So I understand . And I know that this has been some of the conventional wisdom that is been floating around Washington that somehow , even though most people agree that I am being reasonable , that most people agree I am presenting a fair deal , the fact that they do not take it means that I should somehow do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what is right . Well , they are elected . We have a constitutional system of government . The Speaker of the House and the leader of the Senate and all those folks have responsibilities . What I can do is I can make the best possible case for why we need to do the right thing . I can speak to the American people about the consequences of the decisions that Congress is making or the lack of decision making by Congress . But , ultimately , it is a choice they make . And this idea that somehow there is a secret formula or secret sauce to get Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say , you know what , Mr . President , you are right , we should close some tax loopholes for the well off and well connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we do not need . I think if there was a secret way to do that , I would have tried it . I would have done it . What I can do is I can make the best possible argument . And I can offer concessions , and I can offer compromise . I can negotiate . I can make sure that my party is willing to compromise and is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of political terms . And I think I have done that and I will continue to do that . But what I cannot do is force Congress to do the right thing . The American people may have the capacity to do that . And in the absence of a decision on the part of the Speaker of the House and others to put middle class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now , we are going to have these cuts in place . But , again , I am hopeful about human nature . I think that over time people do the right thing . And I will keep on reaching out and seeing if there are other formulas or other ways to jigger this thing into place so that we get a better result . Well Jessica , look , I will just give you an example . The Department of Defense right now has to figure out how the children of military families are going to continue with their schooling over the next several months , because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians . They are therefore subject to furlough , which means that they may not be able to teach one day a week . Now , I expect that we will be able to manage around it . But if I am a man or woman in uniform in Afghanistan right now , the notion that my spouse back home is having to worry about whether or not our kids are getting the best education possible , the notion that my school for my children on an Army base might be disrupted because Congress did not act , that is an impact . Now , Mayor Bloomberg and others may not feel that impact . I suspect they will not . But that family will . The Border Patrol agents who are out there in the hot sun , doing what Congress said they are supposed to be doing , finding out suddenly that they are getting a 10 percent pay cut and having to go home and explain that to their families , I do not think they feel like this is an exaggerated impact . So I guess it depends on where you sit . Now , what is absolutely true is that not everybody is going to feel it . Not everybody is going to feel it all at once . What is true is that the accumulation of those stories all across this country , folks who suddenly might have been working all their lives to get an education , just so that they can get that job and get out of welfare and they have got their kid in Head Start , and now , suddenly , that Head Start slot is gone and they are trying to figure out how am I going to keep my job , because I cannot afford child care for my kid some of the suppliers for those shipbuilders down in Virginia , where you have got some suppliers who are small businesses , this is all they do , and they may shut down those companies , and their employees are going to be laid off the accumulation of all of those stories of impact is going to make our economy weaker . It is going to mean less growth . It is going to mean hundreds of thousands of jobs lost . That is real . That is not we are not making that up . That is not a scare tactic , that is a fact . Starting tomorrow , everybody here , all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol now that Congress has left , somebody is going to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the garbage they are going to have less pay . The janitors , the security guards , they just got a pay cut , and they have got to figure out how to manage that . That is real . So I want to be very clear here . It is absolutely true that this is not going to precipitate the kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the problems around the debt ceiling . I do not anticipate a huge financial crisis , but people are going to be hurt . The economy will not grow as quickly as it would have . Unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have and there are lives behind that . And that is real . And it is not necessary that is the problem . Christi Parsons . Hey , Christi . As everybody here knows , last year , upon a long period of reflection , I concluded that we cannot discriminate against same sex couples when it comes to marriage that the basic principle that America is founded on the idea that we are all created equal applies to everybody , regardless of sexual orientation , as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity . And I think that the same evolution that I have gone through is an evolution that the country as a whole has gone through . And I think it is a profoundly positive thing . So that when the Supreme Court essentially called the question by taking this case about California s law , I did not feel like that was something that this administration could avoid . I felt it was important for us to articulate what I believe and what this administration stands for . And although I do think that we are seeing , on a state by state basis , progress being made more and more states recognizing same sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do when the Supreme Court asks , do you think that the California law , which does not provide any rationale for discriminating against same sex couples other than just the notion that , well , they are same sex couples , if the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General , do we think that meets constitutional muster , I felt it was important for us to answer that question honestly and the answer is no . Well , that is an argument that I have made personally . The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court is obliged to answer the specific question before them . And the specific question presented before the Court right now is whether Prop 8 and the California law is unconstitutional . And what we have done is we have put forward a basic principle , which is which applies to all equal protection cases . Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against , the Court asks the question , what is the rationale for this and it better be a good reason . And if you do not have a good reason , we are going to strike it down . And what we have said is , is that same sex couples are a group , a class that deserves heightened scrutiny , that the Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it is doing it . And if the state does not have a good reason , it should be struck down . That is the core principle as applied to this case . Now , the Court may decide that if it does not apply in this case , it probably cannot apply in any case . There is no good reason for it . If I were on the Court , that would probably be the view that I had put forward . But I am not a judge , I am the President . So the basic principle , though , is let us treat everybody fairly and let us treat everybody equally . And I think that the brief that is been presented accurately reflects our views . Ari Shapiro . Right . Well , a couple of things . Number one is to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that are important to middle class Americans and those who are fighting to get into the middle class . So if you set aside budget fights for a second , we have been able to get now the Violence Against Women Act done . The conversations that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward . We have seen great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system , including around early childhood education . There have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence . And what I am going to keep on trying to do is to make sure that we push on those things that are important to families . And we will not get everything done all at once , but we can get a lot done . So that is point number one . With respect to the budget , what I have done is to make a case to the American people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction , but that deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy . And part of the challenge that we have had here is that not only Congress , but I think Washington generally spends all its time together about deficits and does not spend a lot of time talking about how do we create jobs . So I want to make sure that we are talking about both . I think that , for example , we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuilding our roads and bridges . And this is deferred maintenance . We know we are going to have to do it . And I went to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell s state to John Boehner s state , and it was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it . And I will bet they really want to see that improved . Well , how do we do it Let us have a conversation about it . That will create jobs . It will be good for businesses , reduce commuter times , improve commuter safety . That has to be part of this conversation , not just this constant argument about cutting and spending . So I guess my point is , Ari , that what I want to try to do is to make sure that we are constantly focused , that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed . Deficit reduction is part of that agenda and an important part . But it is not the only part . And I do not want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this one thing . And as I already said to Jessica , what I am also hoping is , is that , over time perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say , you know what , we stuck tough on the sequester , and this makes us feel good , and the Republican caucus is in a better mood when they come back maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are . And the good thing about America is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we get stuck , and you have these sharp , partisan fights , but the American people pretty steadily are common sense and practical , and eventually , that common sense , practical approach wins out . And I think that is what will happen here as well . And , in the meantime , just to make the final point about the sequester , we will get through this . This is not going to be a apocalypse , I think as some people have said . It is just dumb . And it is going to hurt . It is going to hurt individual people and it is going to hurt the economy overall . But if Congress comes to its senses a week from now , a month from now , three months from now , then there is a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the American people dramatically . So this is a temporary stop on what I believe is the long term , outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness . Thank you very much .Hello , Warrensburg Hello , Mules Hello , Jennies Well , I know it is hot . That is why I took off my jacket . If you have still got yours on feel free to take it off . It is great to be back in Missouri . It is great to be back in the Midwest . It is great to be here at UC I want to thank your outstanding president , Dr . Chuck Ambrose , for having me here today . Give Brian a big round of applause for the introduction . You have got your outstanding governor , Jay Nixon , in the house . Your mayor , Charlie Rutt , is here . And I brought a special guest with me who is celebrating her birthday today your senator , Claire McCaskill . I figured the least I could do is give her a ride on Air Force One for her birthday . So we have got Mules in the house . We have got Jennies in the house . We have got governors , we have got senators , and now we have probably got some very confused people watching at home , because who is Jennie I want to thank all the students who came out on a summer afternoon . I know that summer is especially a day as pretty as today , it is tempting to be outside . I know classes do not start for a few more weeks . You could be over on Pine Street beating the heat . Now that I think about it , it may be good that you are here instead of getting into trouble . I have just come from Knox College in Galesburg , Illinois , where I gave a pretty long speech on the economy . I will not repeat the whole thing here . But what I did want to talk about today is what I have talked about when I gave my first big speech as a senator eight years ago , and that is where we as a country need to go to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century . And UCM understands how important that is . Just a little context here in the period after World War Iyou had a growing middle class that was the engine of our prosperity . The economy did well in part because everybody was participating . And whether you owned a company , or you swept the floors of that company , or you worked anywhere in between , America offered a basic bargain If you work hard , then you will be rewarded with fair wages and benefits . You will have the chance to buy your own home . You will have the chance to save for retirement . You will have the protection of decent health insurance . But most of all , you will have the chance to pass on a better life to your kids . And then what happened was that engine began to stall . The bargain began to fray . So technology made some jobs obsolete nobody goes to a bank teller anymore . You want to schedule a trip somewhere , you get online . Global competition sent some jobs overseas . When I was in Galesburg , we talked about the Maytag plant that used to make household brands there and people thousands of people used to work in the plant and it went down to Mexico . Then Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to folks at the top income brackets , smaller minimum wage increases for people who were struggling . You combine all this and the income of the top 1 percent quadrupled from 1979 to 2007 , but the typical family s incomes barely budged . So a lot of middle class families began to feel that the odds were stacked against them and they were right . And then for a while , this was kind of papered over because we had a housing bubble going on , and everybody was maxing out on their credit cards , everybody was highly leveraged , there were a lot of financial deals going around . And so it looked like the economy was going to be doing okay , but then by the time I took office , the bottom had fallen out . And it cost , as we know , millions of Americans their jobs or their homes or their savings . And that long term erosion of middle class security was evident for everybody to see . Now , the good news is , five years later , five years after the crisis first hit , America has fought its way back . So together , we saved an auto industry . We took on a broken health care system . We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil . We doubled the production of clean energy . Natural gas took off . We put in place tough new rules on big banks and mortgage lenders and credit card companies . We changed the tax code so it was fair for middle class folks and did not just benefit folks at the very top like me . No , it is true , because things were skewed too much towards folks who were already blessed , already lucky . And you take all that together and now you add it all up . What we have seen is over the past 40 months , our businesses have created more than 7 . 2 million new jobs . This year , we are off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999 . Our exports have surged , so we sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before . We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth . We are about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from overseas , and that is the first time that is happened in nearly 20 years . The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years , so we are slowing the growth of health care costs . And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years . Deficits have been cut by almost half from the time I took office . So we did this together , because Americans are gritty and resilient and work hard . We have been able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis . We are starting to lay a new foundation for more durable economic growth . And with the new revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care , we are actually poised we are in a position to reverse all those forces that battered middle class families for too long . We can start building now an economy where everybody who works hard can get ahead . That is all good . That is the good news . But , Missouri , I am here to tell you what you already know , which is we are not there yet . In some ways , the trends that have been building for decades this winner take all economy where a few do better and better , but everybody else just treads water all those trends were made worse by the recession . And reversing these trends has to be Washington s number one priority . It has to be Washington s number one priority . Putting people back to work , making sure the economy is working for everybody , building the middle class , making sure they are secure that is my highest priority . That is what I am interested in . Because when the economy is working for middle class families , it solves an awful lot of other problems . Now the poor start having ladders of opportunity they can climb into if they work hard . A lot of the social tensions are reduced , because everybody is feeling pretty good . Now , unfortunately , over the past couple of years in particular , Washington has not just ignored this problem they have actually made it worse . And I am interested in working with everybody , and there are a bunch of not just Democrats , but also Republicans who recognize that Washington is not working . But we have also seen a group of folks , particularly in the House , a group of Republicans in Congress that they suggested they would not vote to pay the bills that Congress had already run up . And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery back in 2011 . We have got a growing number of Republican senators who are trying to get things done with their Democratic counterparts just passed an immigration bill that economists say is going to boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars . But so far , at least , there is a faction of House Republicans who will not let the bill go to the floor for a vote . And if you ask them , well , okay , what is your economic agenda for the middle class , how are we going to grow our economy so everybody prospers , they will start talking about out of control government spending although , as I said , government spending has actually gone down and deficits are going down or they will talk about Obamacare , the whole idea that somehow if we do not provide health insurance to 50 million Americans that is going to improve the economy . Never mind the fact that our jobs growth is a lot faster now than it was during the last recovery when Obamacare was not around . So we have got some basic challenges that we are just going to have to meet . We have cut our deficit . We are creating jobs at nearly twice the pace . We are providing health care for Americans that need it . But we now have to get back and focus on what is important . An endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals cannot get in the way of what we need to do . And I am here to say it is got to stop . We have got to focus on jobs and the economy , and helping middle class families get ahead . And if we do that , we are going to solve a whole lot of problems . And as we are thinking about these issues , we cannot get involved in short term thinking . We cannot have all the same old debates . That is not what the moment requires . We have got to focus on the core economic issues that matter to you . And as Washington is now preparing for another debate about the budget , the stakes could not be higher . If we do not make the investments America needs to make this country a magnet for good jobs , if we do not make investments in education and manufacturing and science and research and transportation and information networks , we will be waving the white flag while other countries forge ahead in a global economy . If we just stand by and do nothing , we are saying it is okay for middle class folks to keep taking it on the chin . And I do not think it is okay . And that is why I came here to Warrensburg today . I need you involved in this debate to remind Washington what is at stake . And over the next several weeks , in towns just like this one , I am going to lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class , what it takes to work your way into the middle class a good job with good wages in durable , growing industries a good education for our kids and our workers a home to call your own affordable health care that is there for you when you or your family members get sick a secure retirement even if you are not rich more ladders of opportunity for people who want to earn their way into the middle class as long as they are willing to work for it . And what we need what we need is not a three month plan , or even a three year plan we need a long term plan based on steady , persistent effort to reverse the forces that have conspired against middle class families for decades . And I am confident I know there are members of both parties who understand what is at stake . So I welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum . But I am not going to allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in this country s way . We have got to get moving . So where I can act on my own , I am going to . I am not going to wait for Congress . Because the choices that we make now are not just going to determine what happens to the young people here at this school , it is going to determine what happens to your kids and your grandkids . So one thing I really want to focus on here , because UCM is doing some extraordinary things , I want to focus on just briefly that second cornerstone an education that prepares our kids and our workers for the global competition that you will face . That is why I wanted to highlight what is happening here at the University of Central Missouri , because you guys are doing some things right . In an age where business knows no borders , jobs are going to seek out the countries that have the most talented , skilled citizens , and those are the folks who are going to make a good living . The days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody with a college degree those days are over . You can see it all throughout the Midwest , where you have got folks who a generation ago could just walk into a factory or a plant , did not have a lot of skills , get trained on the job , make a good living , live out a middle class life . That is not going to happen anymore . Technology , global competition those things are not going away . So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to lower living standards , or we can do what America has always done we can adapt , we can pull together , we can fight back , we can win . And if we do not invest in American education , then we are going to put our kids , our workers , our countries , our businesses at a competitive disadvantage . Because if you think it is if you think education is expensive , you should see how much ignorance is going to cost in the 21st century . It is going to be expensive . So what do we need to do on education Number one , it is got to start in the earliest years . And that means working with states to make high quality preschool available for every four year old in America . Every study shows this is a smart investment , encourages healthy behaviors , increases our kids success in the classroom , increases their earning power as they grow up , reduces rates of teen pregnancy , reduces criminal behavior . It is really important . And any working parent will tell you that knowing your kid is in a safe place to learn is a big relief , so it is also important for the parents . This idea of early childhood education , it should not be partisan . States with Republican governors are doing it just like a lot of Democratic governors are doing it . Our kids do not care about politics . We should prove that we care about them and make this thing happen . And I am going to keep on pushing , as long as I am President , until we have a situation where every kid is getting a good , healthy start in life and are prepared when they go to school . We are going to take action on proven ideas to upgrade our schools that do not require Congress . So for example , last month , I announced a goal of connecting 99 percent of America s students to high speed Internet within five years . We are going ahead and taking steps for that to happen right now . Now , some of you may have gone to schools where you had internet in every classroom , but a lot of schools right now , they have got maybe a computer lab , but if you go in the classroom , kids , they do not have it . In America , in this country , every child at every desk should have access to the entire world s information , and every teacher should have the cutting edge technology to help their kids succeed and learn . We are going to make that happen . We have got to rethink our high schools so that our kids graduate with the real world skills that this new age demands . We have got to reward the schools that forge partnerships with local colleges and businesses , and that focus on the fields of the future like science and technology and math and engineering . And I am going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that affects probably everybody here , and that is the soaring cost of higher education . Now , three years ago , I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars were not going to pad the pockets of big banks , and instead were going to help students get a college education . So millions of students were helped by that . We took action to cap loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers . A lot of young people do not know this , but if you have taken out federal loans , then if you choose a job , let us say , that does not pay as much as you had like or you deserve , if you are a teacher or some other profession , you only have to pay 10 percent of your income , which means that you can afford to go to college and know that you are not going to be broke when you graduate which is important . And not enough young people are using this . As we speak and then , as we speak , we are working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because Congress did not get its act together . We have got to get student loan rates interest rates back down . So these are all good steps , but here s the problem and this is where what is happening at University of Central Missouri is so important . We can put more and more money into student loans , we can put more and more money into grants , but if college costs keep on going up , then there is never going to be enough money . I can keep student loan rates low , but if you are borrowing 80 , 000 for college , or 100 , 000 and you get out , it does not matter whether interest rate is 3 . 5 or 8 . 5 , you are still going to have trouble repaying it . It will take you longer to buy a house . If you have got an idea for a business , it is going to take you longer to invest in starting your business . So we have got to do something about college costs . Families and taxpayers cannot just keep paying more and more into an undisciplined system . We have got to get a better bang for our buck . So states have to do their part by prioritizing higher education in their budgets because part of the reason tuition has been skyrocketing is colleges are not state funded colleges are not getting as much funding , and so then tuition is going up on the backs of students and families . But we have also got to test new ways of funding based not just on how many students enroll , but how well they do . And colleges have to do their part by keeping costs from going up . So here at Central Missouri , you are a laboratory for this kind of innovation . I had a great discussion with not only the president of this university but also the superintendent of schools here , the head of the community colleges . What is happened at UCM is you have partnered with the Lee s Summit School District , with the Metropolitan Community College , with local health care , engineering , energy , and infrastructure firms all industries that are going to drive job growth in the future and everybody is now working together to equip students with better skills , allow them to graduate faster with less debt , and with the certainty of being able to get a job at the other end . That is a recipe for success over the long term . So we have got students at Summit Technology Academy there we go . Those students , they are beginning to accrue credits towards an associate s degree while they are still in high school , which means they can come here to earn a bachelor s degree in two years and graduate debt free . Debt free , on a fast track . And because the community colleges and industries are involved , students are making quicker decisions about the industries that are going to create jobs , and the businesses are helping to design the programs to make sure that they have the skills for those jobs so that not only are you graduating debt free , but you also know that you have got a job waiting for you on the other end . Now , that is exactly the kind of innovation we need when it comes to college costs . That is what is happening right here in Warrensburg . And I want the entire country to notice it , and I want other colleges to take a look at what is being done here . And I have asked my team to shake the trees all across the country for some of the best ideas out there for keeping college costs down , so that as students prepare to go back to school , I am in a position to lay out what is going to be an aggressive strategy to shake up the system to make sure that middle class students , working class students , poor kids who have the drive and the wherewithal and want to get a good college education , they can get it without basically mortgaging their entire future . We can make this happen but this is an example of the kind of thing we have got to focus on instead of a bunch of distractions in Washington . Tackling college costs , creating more good jobs , establishing a better bargain for middle class families and everybody trying to work to join into it , an economy that grows not from the top down but from the middle out that is not just what I am going to focus on for the next few months , that is what I am going to be focused on for the remainder of my presidency . And I am going to take these plans all across the country , and I am going to ask folks for help because , frankly , sometimes I just cannot wait for Congress . It just takes them a long time to decide on stuff . So we are going to reach out to CEOs and we are going to reach out to workers , and we are going to reach out to college presidents and we are going to reach out to students . We will talk to Democrats and independents and , yes , I will be asking Republicans to get involved because this has to be our core project for the next decade . I want to lay out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot in the 21st century . And look , I want Republicans to lay out their ideas . If they have got a better idea to bring down college costs that we have not thought of , let us hear them . I am ready to go . If they have got a better plan to make sure that every American knows the security of affordable health care , then please share it with the class . Raise your hand . But what you cannot do is just manufacture another crisis because you think it might be good politics , just as our economy is getting some traction . What you cannot do is shut down our government just because I am for opening the government . You cannot threaten not to pay the bills this country racked up or to cut investments in education and science and basic research that are going to help us grow . If we are going to manage deficits and debt , let us do it in a sensible way . We can do this if we work together . And it may seem hard right now , but if we are willing to take a few bold steps if Washington will just shake off its complacency , set aside the kind of slash and burn partisanship that we have seen over the past few years I promise you , our economy will be stronger a year from now , just like it is stronger now than it was last year . And then it will be stronger five years from now , and then it will be stronger 10 years from now . And more Americans will have the pride of a first paycheck . And more Americans will have the satisfaction of starting their own business and flipping that sign that says open . More folks will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this , and then know that they have got a job waiting for them when they graduate . What makes us special a lot of times we talk about American exceptionalism and how much we love this country , and there are so many wonderful things about our country . But what makes us the envy of the world has not just been our ability to generate incredible wealth for a few people it is the fact that we have given everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness . That is who we are . We have not just wanted success for ourselves we want it for our neighbors . We want it for our neighborhoods . That is why we do not call it Bob s dream or Barbara s dream or Barack s dream we call it the American Dream . It is one that we share . That is who we are the idea that no matter who you are , what you look like , where you come from , who you love , you can make it here in America if you are trying hard . That is what a college education can be all about . That is what inspires your President , that is what inspires the faculty . That is why when we see young people like you , we are inspired because you are an expression of that idea . And we have got to make sure that that continues not just for this generation , but for the next generation . And I have got a hundred I have got 1 , 267 days left in my presidency . And I am going to spend every minute , every second , as long as I have the privilege of being in this office , making sure that I am doing every single thing that I can so that middle class families , working families , people who are out there struggling every single day that they know that that work can lead them to a better place . And we are going to make sure that that American Dream is available for everybody , not just now , but in the future . So thank you , Missouri . Thank you , UCThank you , Mules . Thank you , Jennies . God bless you . God bless the United States of America . Let us get to work .My fellow Americans , tonight I want to talk to you about Syria why it matters , and where we go from here . Over the past two years , what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al Assad has turned into a brutal civil war . Over 100 , 000 people have been killed . Millions have fled the country . In that time , America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support , to help the moderate opposition , and to shape a political settlement . But I have resisted calls for military action , because we cannot resolve someone else s civil war through force , particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan . The situation profoundly changed , though , on August 21st , when Assad s government gassed to death over a thousand people , including hundreds of children . The images from this massacre are sickening Men , women , children lying in rows , killed by poison gas . Others foaming at the mouth , gasping for breath . A father clutching his dead children , imploring them to get up and walk . On that terrible night , the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons , and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off limits a crime against humanity , and a violation of the laws of war . This was not always the case . In World War American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe . In World War Ithe Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust . Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale , with no distinction between soldier and infant , the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them . And in 1997 , the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons , now joined by 189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity . On August 21st , these basic rules were violated , along with our sense of common humanity . No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria . The world saw thousands of videos , cell phone pictures , and social media accounts from the attack , and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas . Moreover , we know the Assad regime was responsible . In the days leading up to August 21st , we know that Assad s chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas . They distributed gasmasks to their troops . Then they fired rockets from a regime controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces . Shortly after those rockets landed , the gas spread , and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded . We know senior figures in Assad s military machine reviewed the results of the attack , and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed . We have also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin . When dictators commit atrocities , they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory . But these things happened . The facts cannot be denied . The question now is what the United States of America , and the international community , is prepared to do about it . Because what happened to those people to those children is not only a violation of international law , it is also a danger to our security . Let me explain why . If we fail to act , the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons . As the ban against these weapons erodes , other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas , and using them . Over time , our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield . And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons , and to use them to attack civilians . If fighting spills beyond Syria s borders , these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey , Jordan , and Israel . And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction , and embolden Assad s ally , Iran which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon , or to take a more peaceful path . This is not a world we should accept . This is what is at stake . And that is why , after careful deliberation , I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime s use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike . The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons , to degrade his regime s ability to use them , and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use . That is my judgment as Commander in Chief . But I am also the President of the world s oldest constitutional democracy . So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes , I believed it was right , in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security , to take this debate to Congress . I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress . And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together . This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war making power in the hands of the President , and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops , while sidelining the people s representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force . Now , I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan , the idea of any military action , no matter how limited , is not going to be popular . After all , I have spent four and a half years working to end wars , not to start them . Our troops are out of Iraq . Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan . And I know Americans want all of us in Washington especially me to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home putting people back to work , educating our kids , growing our middle class . It is no wonder , then , that you are asking hard questions . So let me answer some of the most important questions that I have heard from members of Congress , and that I have read in letters that you have sent to me . First , many of you have asked , will not this put us on a slippery slope to another war One man wrote to me that we are still recovering from our involvement in Iraq . A veteran put it more bluntly This nation is sick and tired of war . My answer is simple I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria . I will not pursue an open ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan . I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo . This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective deterring the use of chemical weapons , and degrading Assad s capabilities . Others have asked whether it is worth acting if we do not take out Assad . As some members of Congress have said , there is no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria . Let me make something clear The United States military does not do pinpricks . Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver . I do not think we should remove another dictator with force we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next . But a targeted strike can make Assad , or any other dictator , think twice before using chemical weapons . Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation . We do not dismiss any threats , but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military . Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day . Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise . And our ally , Israel , can defend itself with overwhelming force , as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America . Many of you have asked a broader question Why should we get involved at all in a place that is so complicated , and where as one person wrote to me those who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights It is true that some of Assad s opponents are extremists . But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death . The majority of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition we work with just want to live in peace , with dignity and freedom . And the day after any military action , we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism . Finally , many of you have asked Why not leave this to other countries , or seek solutions short of force As several people wrote to me , We should not be the world s policeman . I agree , and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions . Over the last two years , my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions , warning and negotiations but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime . However , over the last few days , we have seen some encouraging signs . In part because of the credible threat of military action , as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin , the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons . The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons , and even said they had join the Chemical Weapons Convention , which prohibits their use . It is too early to tell whether this offer will succeed , and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments . But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force , particularly because Russia is one of Assad s strongest allies . I have , therefore , asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path . I am sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday , and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin . I have spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies , France and the United Kingdom , and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons , and to ultimately destroy them under international control . We will also give inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st . And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas from Asia to the Middle East who agree on the need for action . Meanwhile , I have ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad , and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails . And tonight , I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices . My fellow Americans , for nearly seven decades , the United States has been the anchor of global security . This has meant doing more than forging international agreements it has meant enforcing them . The burdens of leadership are often heavy , but the world is a better place because we have borne them . And so , to my friends on the right , I ask you to reconcile your commitment to America s military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just . To my friends on the left , I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain , and going still on a cold hospital floor . For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough . Indeed , I had ask every member of Congress , and those of you watching at home tonight , to view those videos of the attack , and then ask What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas , and we choose to look the other way Franklin Roosevelt once said , Our national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged . Our ideals and principles , as well as our national security , are at stake in Syria , along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used . America is not the world s policeman . Terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong . But when , with modest effort and risk , we can stop children from being gassed to death , and thereby make our own children safer over the long run , I believe we should act . That is what makes America different . That is what makes us exceptional . With humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth . Thank you . God bless you . And God bless the United States of America .Thank you . Thank you , everybody . Thank you so much . Please , please have a seat . Thank you so much . Well , thank you , Neera , for the wonderful introduction and sharing a story that resonated with me . There were a lot of parallels in my life and probably resonated with some of you . Over the past 10 years , the Center for American Progress has done incredible work to shape the debate over expanding opportunity for all Americans . And I could not be more grateful to CAP not only for giving me a lot of good policy ideas , but also giving me a lot of staff . My friend , John Podesta , ran my transition my Chief of Staff , Denis McDonough , did a stint at CASo you guys are obviously doing a good job training folks . I also want to thank all the members of Congress and my administration who are here today for the wonderful work that they do . I want to thank Mayor Gray and everyone here at THEARC for having me . This center , which I have been to quite a bit , have had a chance to see some of the great work that is done here . And all the nonprofits that call THEARC home offer access to everything from education , to health care , to a safe shelter from the streets , which means that you are harnessing the power of community to expand opportunity for folks here in And your work reflects a tradition that runs through our history a belief that we are greater together than we are on our own . And that is what I have come here to talk about today . Over the last two months , Washington has been dominated by some pretty contentious debates I think that is fair to say . And between a reckless shutdown by congressional Republicans in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act , and admittedly poor execution on my administration s part in implementing the latest stage of the new law , nobody has acquitted themselves very well these past few months . So it is not surprising that the American people s frustrations with Washington are at an all time high . But we know that people s frustrations run deeper than these most recent political battles . Their frustration is rooted in their own daily battles to make ends meet , to pay for college , buy a home , save for retirement . It is rooted in the nagging sense that no matter how hard they work , the deck is stacked against them . And it is rooted in the fear that their kids will not be better off than they were . They may not follow the constant back and forth in Washington or all the policy details , but they experience in a very personal way the relentless , decades long trend that I want to spend some time talking about today . And that is a dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle class America s basic bargain that if you work hard , you have a chance to get ahead . I believe this is the defining challenge of our time Making sure our economy works for every working American . It is why I ran for President . It was at the center of last year s campaign . It drives everything I do in this office . And I know I have raised this issue before , and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now . I do it because the outcomes of the debates we are having right now whether it is health care , or the budget , or reforming our housing and financial systems all these things will have real , practical implications for every American . And I am convinced that the decisions we make on these issues over the next few years will determine whether or not our children will grow up in an America where opportunity is real . Now , the premise that we are all created equal is the opening line in the American story . And while we do not promise equal outcomes , we have strived to deliver equal opportunity the idea that success does not depend on being born into wealth or privilege , it depends on effort and merit . And with every chapter we have added to that story , we have worked hard to put those words into practice . It was Abraham Lincoln , a self described poor man s son , who started a system of land grant colleges all over this country so that any poor man s son could go learn something new . When farms gave way to factories , a rich man s son named Teddy Roosevelt fought for an eight hour workday , protections for workers , and busted monopolies that kept prices high and wages low . When millions lived in poverty , FDR fought for Social Security , and insurance for the unemployed , and a minimum wage . When millions died without health insurance , LBJ fought for Medicare and Medicaid . Together , we forged a New Deal , declared a War on Poverty in a great society . We built a ladder of opportunity to climb , and stretched out a safety net beneath so that if we fell , it would not be too far , and we could bounce back . And as a result , America built the largest middle class the world has ever known . And for the three decades after World War Iit was the engine of our prosperity . Now , we cannot look at the past through rose colored glasses . The economy did not always work for everyone . Racial discrimination locked millions out of poverty or out of opportunity . Women were too often confined to a handful of often poorly paid professions . And it was only through painstaking struggle that more women , and minorities , and Americans with disabilities began to win the right to more fairly and fully participate in the economy . Nevertheless , during the post World War II years , the economic ground felt stable and secure for most Americans , and the future looked brighter than the past . And for some , that meant following in your old man s footsteps at the local plant , and you knew that a blue collar job would let you buy a home , and a car , maybe a vacation once in a while , health care , a reliable pension . For others , it meant going to college in some cases , maybe the first in your family to go to college . And it meant graduating without taking on loads of debt , and being able to count on advancement through a vibrant job market . Now , it is true that those at the top , even in those years , claimed a much larger share of income than the rest The top 10 percent consistently took home about one third of our national income . But that kind of inequality took place in a dynamic market economy where everyone s wages and incomes were growing . And because of upward mobility , the guy on the factory floor could picture his kid running the company some day . But starting in the late 70s , this social compact began to unravel . Technology made it easier for companies to do more with less , eliminating certain job occupations . A more competitive world lets companies ship jobs anywhere . And as good manufacturing jobs automated or headed offshore , workers lost their leverage , jobs paid less and offered fewer benefits . As values of community broke down , and competitive pressure increased , businesses lobbied Washington to weaken unions and the value of the minimum wage . As a trickle down ideology became more prominent , taxes were slashed for the wealthiest , while investments in things that make us all richer , like schools and infrastructure , were allowed to wither . And for a certain period of time , we could ignore this weakening economic foundation , in part because more families were relying on two earners as women entered the workforce . We took on more debt financed by a juiced up housing market . But when the music stopped , and the crisis hit , millions of families were stripped of whatever cushion they had left . And the result is an economy that is become profoundly unequal , and families that are more insecure . I will just give you a few statistics . Since 1979 , when I graduated from high school , our productivity is up by more than 90 percent , but the income of the typical family has increased by less than eight percent . Since 1979 , our economy has more than doubled in size , but most of that growth has flowed to a fortunate few . The top 10 percent no longer takes in one third of our income it now takes half . Whereas in the past , the average CEO made about 20 to 30 times the income of the average worker , today s CEO now makes 273 times more . And meanwhile , a family in the top 1 percent has a net worth 288 times higher than the typical family , which is a record for this country . So the basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed . In fact , this trend towards growing inequality is not unique to America s market economy . Across the developed world , inequality has increased . Some of you may have seen just last week , the Pope himself spoke about this at eloquent length . How can it be , he wrote , that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure , but it is news when the stock market loses two points But this increasing inequality is most pronounced in our country , and it challenges the very essence of who we are as a people . Understand we have never begrudged success in America . We aspire to it . We admire folks who start new businesses , create jobs , and invent the products that enrich our lives . And we expect them to be rewarded handsomely for it . In fact , we have often accepted more income inequality than many other nations for one big reason because we were convinced that America is a place where even if you are born with nothing , with a little hard work you can improve your own situation over time and build something better to leave your kids . As Lincoln once said , While we do not propose any war upon capital , we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else . The problem is that alongside increased inequality , we have seen diminished levels of upward mobility in recent years . A child born in the top 20 percent has about a 2 in 3 chance of staying at or near the top . A child born into the bottom 20 percent has a less than 1 in 20 shot at making it to the top . He is 10 times likelier to stay where he is . In fact , statistics show not only that our levels of income inequality rank near countries like Jamaica and Argentina , but that it is harder today for a child born here in America to improve her station in life than it is for children in most of our wealthy allies countries like Canada or Germany or France . They have greater mobility than we do , not less . The idea that so many children are born into poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth is heartbreaking enough . But the idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lacks a decent education or health care , or a community that views her future as their own , that should offend all of us and it should compel us to action . We are a better country than this . So let me repeat The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream , our way of life , and what we stand for around the globe . And it is not simply a moral claim that I am making here . There are practical consequences to rising inequality and reduced mobility . For one thing , these trends are bad for our economy . One study finds that growth is more fragile and recessions are more frequent in countries with greater inequality . And that makes sense . When families have less to spend , that means businesses have fewer customers , and households rack up greater mortgage and credit card debt meanwhile , concentrated wealth at the top is less likely to result in the kind of broadly based consumer spending that drives our economy , and together with lax regulation , may contribute to risky speculative bubbles . And rising inequality and declining mobility are also bad for our families and social cohesion not just because we tend to trust our institutions less , but studies show we actually tend to trust each other less when there is greater inequality . And greater inequality is associated with less mobility between generations . That means it is not just temporary the effects last . It creates a vicious cycle . For example , by the time she turns three years old , a child born into a low income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well off family , which means by the time she starts school she is already behind , and that deficit can compound itself over time . And finally , rising inequality and declining mobility are bad for our democracy . Ordinary folks cannot write massive campaign checks or hire high priced lobbyists and lawyers to secure policies that tilt the playing field in their favor at everyone else s expense . And so people get the bad taste that the system is rigged , and that increases cynicism and polarization , and it decreases the political participation that is a requisite part of our system of self government . So this is an issue that we have to tackle head on . And if , in fact , the majority of Americans agree that our number one priority is to restore opportunity and broad based growth for all Americans , the question is why has Washington consistently failed to act And I think a big reason is the myths that have developed around the issue of inequality . First , there is the myth that this is a problem restricted to a small share of predominantly minority poor that this is not a broad based problem , this is a black problem or a Hispanic problem or a Native American problem . Now , it is true that the painful legacy of discrimination means that African Americans , Latinos , Native Americans are far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity higher unemployment , higher poverty rates . It is also true that women still make 77 cents on the dollar compared to men . So we are going to need strong application of antidiscrimination laws . We are going to need immigration reform that grows the economy and takes people out of the shadows . We are going to need targeted initiatives to close those gaps . But here s an important point . The decades long shifts in the economy have hurt all groups poor and middle class inner city and rural folks men and women and Americans of all races . And as a consequence , some of the social patterns that contribute to declining mobility that were once attributed to the urban poor that is a particular problem for the inner city single parent households or drug abuse it turns out now we are seeing that pop up everywhere . A new study shows that disparities in education , mental health , obesity , absent fathers , isolation from church , isolation from community groups these gaps are now as much about growing up rich or poor as they are about anything else . The gap in test scores between poor kids and wealthy kids is now nearly twice what it is between white kids and black kids . Kids with working class parents are 10 times likelier than kids with middle or upper class parents to go through a time when their parents have no income . So the fact is this The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race , and that gap is growing . So if we are going to take on growing inequality and try to improve upward mobility for all people , we have got to move beyond the false notion that this is an issue exclusively of minority concern . And we have to reject a politics that suggests any effort to address it in a meaningful way somehow pits the interests of a deserving middle class against those of an undeserving poor in search of handouts . Second , we need to dispel the myth that the goals of growing the economy and reducing inequality are necessarily in conflict , when they should actually work in concert . We know from our history that our economy grows best from the middle out , when growth is more widely shared . And we know that beyond a certain level of inequality , growth actually slows altogether . Third , we need to set aside the belief that government cannot do anything about reducing inequality . It is true that government cannot prevent all the downsides of the technological change and global competition that are out there right now , and some of those forces are also some of the things that are helping us grow . And it is also true that some programs in the past , like welfare before it was reformed , were sometimes poorly designed , created disincentives to work . But we have also seen how government action time and again can make an enormous difference in increasing opportunity and bolstering ladders into the middle class . Investments in education , laws establishing collective bargaining , and a minimum wage these all contributed to rising standards of living for massive numbers of Americans . Likewise , when previous generations declared that every citizen of this country deserved a basic measure of security a floor through which they could not fall we helped millions of Americans live in dignity , and gave millions more the confidence to aspire to something better , by taking a risk on a great idea . Without Social Security , nearly half of seniors would be living in poverty half . Today , fewer than 1 in 10 do . Before Medicare , only half of all seniors had some form of health insurance . Today , virtually all do . And because we have strengthened that safety net , and expanded pro work and pro family tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit , a recent study found that the poverty rate has fallen by 40 percent since the 1960s . And these endeavors did not just make us a better country they reaffirmed that we are a great country . So we can make a difference on this . In fact , that is our generation s task to rebuild America s economic and civic foundation to continue the expansion of opportunity for this generation and the next generation . And like Neera , I take this personally . I am only here because this country educated my grandfather on the GI Bill . When my father left and my mom hit hard times trying to raise my sister and me while she was going to school , this country helped make sure we did not go hungry . When Michelle , the daughter of a shift worker at a water plant and a secretary , wanted to go to college , just like me , this country helped us afford it until we could pay it back . So what drives me as a grandson , a son , a father as an American is to make sure that every striving , hardworking , optimistic kid in America has the same incredible chance that this country gave me . It has been the driving force between everything we have done these past five years . And over the course of the next year , and for the rest of my presidency , that is where you should expect my administration to focus all our efforts . Now , you will be pleased to know this is not a State of the Union Address . And many of the ideas that can make the biggest difference in expanding opportunity I have presented before . But let me offer a few key principles , just a roadmap that I believe should guide us in both our legislative agenda and our administrative efforts . To begin with , we have to continue to relentlessly push a growth agenda . It may be true that in today s economy , growth alone does not guarantee higher wages and incomes . We have seen that . But what is also true is we cannot tackle inequality if the economic pie is shrinking or stagnant . The fact is if you are a progressive and you want to help the middle class and the working poor , you have still got to be concerned about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spurs private sector investment . And that is why from day one we have worked to get the economy growing and help our businesses hire . And thanks to their resilience and innovation , they have created nearly 8 million new jobs over the past 44 months . And now we have got to grow the economy even faster . And we have got to keep working to make America a magnet for good , middle class jobs to replace the ones that we have lost in recent decades jobs in manufacturing and energy and infrastructure and technology . And that means simplifying our corporate tax code in a way that closes wasteful loopholes and ends incentives to ship jobs overseas . And by broadening the base , we can actually lower rates to encourage more companies to hire here and use some of the money we save to create good jobs rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports , and all the infrastructure our businesses need . It means a trade agenda that grows exports and works for the middle class . It means streamlining regulations that are outdated or unnecessary or too costly . And it means coming together around a responsible budget one that grows our economy faster right now and shrinks our long term deficits , one that unwinds the harmful sequester cuts that have not made a lot of sense and then frees up resources to invest in things like the scientific research that is always unleashed new innovation and new industries . When it comes to our budget , we should not be stuck in a stale debate from two years ago or three years ago . A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit . So that is step one towards restoring mobility making sure our economy is growing faster . Step two is making sure we empower more Americans with the skills and education they need to compete in a highly competitive global economy . We know that education is the most important predictor of income today , so we launched a Race to the Top in our schools . We are supporting states that have raised standards for teaching and learning . We are pushing for redesigned high schools that graduate more kids with the technical training and apprenticeships , and in demand , high tech skills that can lead directly to a good job and a middle class life . We know it is harder to find a job today without some higher education , so we have helped more students go to college with grants and loans that go farther than before . We have made it more practical to repay those loans . And today , more students are graduating from college than ever before . We are also pursuing an aggressive strategy to promote innovation that reins in tuition costs . We have got lower costs so that young people are not burdened by enormous debt when they make the right decision to get higher education . And next week , Michelle and I will bring together college presidents and non profits to lead a campaign to help more low income students attend and succeed in college . But while higher education may be the surest path to the middle class , it is not the only one . So we should offer our people the best technical education in the world . That is why we have worked to connect local businesses with community colleges , so that workers young and old can earn the new skills that earn them more money . And I have also embraced an idea that I know all of you at the Center for American Progress have championed and , by the way , Republican governors in a couple of states have championed and that is making high quality preschool available to every child in America . We know that kids in these programs grow up likelier to get more education , earn higher wages , form more stable families of their own . It starts a virtuous cycle , not a vicious one . And we should invest in that . We should give all of our children that chance . And as we empower our young people for future success , the third part of this middle class economics is empowering our workers . It is time to ensure our collective bargaining laws function as they are supposed to so unions have a level playing field to organize for a better deal for workers and better wages for the middle class . It is time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so that women will have more tools to fight pay discrimination . It is time to pass the Employment Non Discrimination Act so workers cannot be fired for who they are or who they love . And even though we are bringing manufacturing jobs back to America , we are creating more good paying jobs in education and health care and business services we know that we are going to have a greater and greater portion of our people in the service sector . And we know that there are airport workers , and fast food workers , and nurse assistants , and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty . And that is why it is well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office . This should not be an ideological question . It was Adam Smith , the father of free market economics , who once said , They who feed , clothe , and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed , clothed , and lodged . And for those of you who do not speak old English let me translate . It means if you work hard , you should make a decent living . If you work hard , you should be able to support a family . Now , we all know the arguments that have been used against a higher minimum wage . Some say it actually hurts low wage workers businesses will be less likely to hire them . But there is no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs , and research shows it raises incomes for low wage workers and boosts short term economic growth . Others argue that if we raise the minimum wage , companies will just pass those costs on to consumers . But a growing chorus of businesses , small and large , argue differently . And already , there are extraordinary companies in America that provide decent wages , salaries , and benefits , and training for their workers , and deliver a great product to consumers . SAS in North Carolina offers childcare and sick leave . REa company my Secretary of the Interior used to run , offers retirement plans and strives to cultivate a good work balance . There are companies out there that do right by their workers . They recognize that paying a decent wage actually helps their bottom line , reduces turnover . It means workers have more money to spend , to save , maybe eventually start a business of their own . A broad majority of Americans agree we should raise the minimum wage . That is why , last month , voters in New Jersey decided to become the 20th state to raise theirs even higher . That is why , yesterday , the Council voted to do it , too . I agree with those voters . I agree with those voters , and I am going to keep pushing until we get a higher minimum wage for hard working Americans across the entire country . It will be good for our economy . It will be good for our families . Number four , as I alluded to earlier , we still need targeted programs for the communities and workers that have been hit hardest by economic change and the Great Recession . These communities are no longer limited to the inner city . They are found in neighborhoods hammered by the housing crisis , manufacturing towns hit hard by years of plants packing up , landlocked rural areas where young folks oftentimes feel like they have got to leave just to find a job . There are communities that just are not generating enough jobs anymore . So we have put forward new plans to help these communities and their residents , because we have watched cities like Pittsburgh or my hometown of Chicago revamp themselves . And if we give more cities the tools to do it not handouts , but a hand up cities like Detroit can do it , too . So in a few weeks , we will announce the first of these Promise Zones , urban and rural communities where we are going to support local efforts focused on a national goal and that is a child s course in life should not be determined by the zip code he is born in , but by the strength of his work ethic and the scope of his dreams . And we are also going to have to do more for the long term unemployed . For people who have been out of work for more than six months , often through no fault of their own , life is a catch 22 . Companies will not give their r eacute sum eacute an honest look because they have been laid off so long but they have been laid off so long because companies will not give their r eacute sum eacute an honest look . And that is why earlier this year , I challenged CEOs from some of America s best companies to give these Americans a fair shot . And next month , many of them will join us at the White House for an announcement about this . Fifth , we have got to revamp retirement to protect Americans in their golden years , to make sure another housing collapse does not steal the savings in their homes . We have also got to strengthen our safety net for a new age , so it does not just protect people who hit a run of bad luck from falling into poverty , but also propels them back out of poverty . Today , nearly half of full time workers and 80 percent of part time workers do not have a pension or retirement account at their job . About half of all households do not have any retirement savings . So we are going to have to do more to encourage private savings and shore up the promise of Social Security for future generations . And remember , these are promises we make to one another . We do not do it to replace the free market , but we do it to reduce risk in our society by giving people the ability to take a chance and catch them if they fall . One study shows that more than half of Americans will experience poverty at some point during their adult lives . Think about that . This is not an isolated situation . More than half of Americans at some point in their lives will experience poverty . That is why we have nutrition assistance or the program known as SNAbecause it makes a difference for a mother who is working , but is just having a hard time putting food on the table for her kids . That is why we have unemployment insurance , because it makes a difference for a father who lost his job and is out there looking for a new one that he can keep a roof over his kids heads . By the way , Christmastime is no time for Congress to tell more than 1 million of these Americans that they have lost their unemployment insurance , which is what will happen if Congress does not act before they leave on their holiday vacation . The point is these programs are not typically hammocks for people to just lie back and relax . These programs are almost always temporary means for hardworking people to stay afloat while they try to find a new job or go into school to retrain themselves for the jobs that are out there , or sometimes just to cope with a bout of bad luck . Progressives should be open to reforms that actually strengthen these programs and make them more responsive to a 21st century economy . For example , we should be willing to look at fresh ideas to revamp unemployment and disability programs to encourage faster and higher rates of re employment without cutting benefits . We should not weaken fundamental protections built over generations , because given the constant churn in today s economy and the disabilities that many of our friends and neighbors live with , they are needed more than ever . We should strengthen them and adapt them to new circumstances so they work even better . But understand that these programs of social insurance benefit all of us , because we do not know when we might have a run of bad luck . We do not know when we might lose a job . Of course , for decades , there was one yawning gap in the safety net that did more than anything else to expose working families to the insecurities of today s economy namely , our broken health care system . That is why we fought for the Affordable Care Act because 14 , 000 Americans lost their health insurance every single day , and even more died each year because they did not have health insurance at all . We did it because millions of families who thought they had coverage were driven into bankruptcy by out of pocket costs that they did not realize would be there . Tens of millions of our fellow citizens could not get any coverage at all . And Dr . King once said , Of all the forms of inequality , injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane . Well , not anymore . Because in the three years since we passed this law , the share of Americans with insurance is up , the growth of health care costs are down to their slowest rate in 50 years . More people have insurance , and more have new benefits and protections 100 million Americans who have gained the right for free preventive care like mammograms and contraception the more than 7 million Americans who have saved an average of 1 , 200 on their prescription medicine every American who will not go broke when they get sick because their insurance cannot limit their care anymore . More people without insurance have gained insurance more than 3 million young Americans who have been able to stay on their parents plan , the more than half a million Americans and counting who are poised to get covered starting on January 1st , some for the very first time . And it is these numbers not the ones in any poll that will ultimately determine the fate of this law . It is the measurable outcomes in reduced bankruptcies and reduced hours that have been lost because somebody could not make it to work , and healthier kids with better performance in schools , and young entrepreneurs who have the freedom to go out there and try a new idea those are the things that will ultimately reduce a major source of inequality and help ensure more Americans get the start that they need to succeed in the future . I have acknowledged more than once that we did not roll out parts of this law as well as we should have . But the law is already working in major ways that benefit millions of Americans right now , even as we have begun to slow the rise in health care costs , which is good for family budgets , good for federal and state budgets , and good for the budgets of businesses small and large . So this law is going to work . And for the sake of our economic security , it needs to work . And as people in states as different as California and Kentucky sign up every single day for health insurance , signing up in droves , they are proving they want that economic security . If the Senate Republican leader still thinks he is going to be able to repeal this someday , he might want to check with the more than 60 , 000 people in his home state who are already set to finally have coverage that frees them from the fear of financial ruin , and lets them afford to take their kids to see a doctor . So let me end by addressing the elephant in the room here , which is the seeming inability to get anything done in Washington these days . I realize we are not going to resolve all of our political debates over the best ways to reduce inequality and increase upward mobility this year , or next year , or in the next five years . But it is important that we have a serious debate about these issues . For the longer that current trends are allowed to continue , the more it will feed the cynicism and fear that many Americans are feeling right now that they will never be able to repay the debt they took on to go to college , they will never be able to save enough to retire , they will never see their own children land a good job that supports a family . And that is why , even as I will keep on offering my own ideas for expanding opportunity , I will also keep challenging and welcoming those who oppose my ideas to offer their own . If Republicans have concrete plans that will actually reduce inequality , build the middle class , provide more ladders of opportunity to the poor , let us hear them . I want to know what they are . If you do not think we should raise the minimum wage , let us hear your idea to increase people s earnings . If you do not think every child should have access to preschool , tell us what you had do differently to give them a better shot . If you still do not like Obamacare and I know you do not even though it is built on market based ideas of choice and competition in the private sector , then you should explain how , exactly , you had cut costs , and cover more people , and make insurance more secure . You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for , not just what you are against . That way we can have a vigorous and meaningful debate . That is what the American people deserve . That is what the times demand . It is not enough anymore to just say we should just get our government out of the way and let the unfettered market take care of it for our experience tells us that is just not true . Look , I have never believed that government can solve every problem or should and neither do you . We know that ultimately our strength is grounded in our people individuals out there , striving , working , making things happen . It depends on community , a rich and generous sense of community that is at the core of what happens at THEARC here every day . You understand that turning back rising inequality and expanding opportunity requires parents taking responsibility for their kids , kids taking responsibility to work hard . It requires religious leaders who mobilize their congregations to rebuild neighborhoods block by block , requires civic organizations that can help train the unemployed , link them with businesses for the jobs of the future . It requires companies and CEOs to set an example by providing decent wages , and salaries , and benefits for their workers , and a shot for somebody who is down on his or her luck . We know that is our strength our people , our communities , our businesses . But government cannot stand on the sidelines in our efforts . Because government is us . It can and should reflect our deepest values and commitments . And if we refocus our energies on building an economy that grows for everybody , and gives every child in this country a fair chance at success , then I remain confident that the future still looks brighter than the past , and that the best days for this country we love are still ahead . Thank you , everybody . God bless you . God bless America .Giving all praise and honor to God . The Bible calls us to hope . To persevere , and have faith in things not seen . They were still living by faith when they died , Scripture tells us . They did not receive the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance , admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on Earth . We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith . A man who believed in things not seen . A man who believed there were better days ahead , off in the distance . A man of service who persevered , knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised , because he believed his efforts would deliver a better life for those who followed . To Jennifer , his beloved wife to Eliana and Malana , his beautiful , wonderful daughters to the Mother Emanuel family and the people of Charleston , the people of South Carolina . I cannot claim to have the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well . But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina , back when we were both a little bit younger . Back when I did not have visible grey hair . The first thing I noticed was his graciousness , his smile , his reassuring baritone , his deceptive sense of humor all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation . Friends of his remarked this week that when Clementa Pinckney entered a room , it was like the future arrived that even from a young age , folks knew he was special . Anointed . He was the progeny of a long line of the faithful a family of preachers who spread God s word , a family of protesters who sowed change to expand voting rights and desegregate the South . Clem heard their instruction , and he did not forsake their teaching . He was in the pulpit by 13 , pastor by 18 , public servant by 23 . He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth , nor youth s insecurities instead , he set an example worthy of his position , wise beyond his years , in his speech , in his conduct , in his love , faith , and purity . As a senator , he represented a sprawling swath of the Lowcountry , a place that has long been one of the most neglected in America . A place still wracked by poverty and inadequate schools a place where children can still go hungry and the sick can go without treatment . A place that needed somebody like Clem . His position in the minority party meant the odds of winning more resources for his constituents were often long . His calls for greater equity were too often unheeded , the votes he cast were sometimes lonely . But he never gave up . He stayed true to his convictions . He would not grow discouraged . After a full day at the capitol , he had climb into his car and head to the church to draw sustenance from his family , from his ministry , from the community that loved and needed him . There he would fortify his faith , and imagine what might be . Reverend Pinckney embodied a politics that was neither mean , nor small . He conducted himself quietly , and kindly , and diligently . He encouraged progress not by pushing his ideas alone , but by seeking out your ideas , partnering with you to make things happen . He was full of empathy and fellow feeling , able to walk in somebody else s shoes and see through their eyes . No wonder one of his senate colleagues remembered Senator Pinckney as the most gentle of the 46 of us the best of the 46 of us . Clem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant . But the person who asked probably did not know the history of the AME church . As our brothers and sisters in the AME church know , we do not make those distinctions . Our calling , Clem once said , is not just within the walls of the congregation , but hellip the life and community in which our congregation resides . He embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words that the sweet hour of prayer actually lasts the whole week long that to put our faith in action is more than individual salvation , it is about our collective salvation that to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and house the homeless is not just a call for isolated charity but the imperative of a just society . What a good man . Sometimes I think that is the best thing to hope for when you are eulogized after all the words and recitations and resumes are read , to just say someone was a good man . You do not have to be of high station to be a good man . Preacher by 13 . Pastor by 18 . Public servant by 23 . What a life Clementa Pinckney lived . What an example he set . What a model for his faith . And then to lose him at 41 slain in his sanctuary with eight wonderful members of his flock , each at different stages in life but bound together by a common commitment to God . Cynthia Hurd . Susie Jackson . Ethel Lance . DePayne Middleton Doctor . Tywanza Sanders . Daniel Simmons . Sharonda Coleman Singleton . Myra Thompson . Good people . Decent people . God fearing people . People so full of life and so full of kindness . People who ran the race , who persevered . People of great faith . To the families of the fallen , the nation shares in your grief . Our pain cuts that much deeper because it happened in a church . The church is and always has been the center of African American life a place to call our own in a too often hostile world , a sanctuary from so many hardships . Over the course of centuries , black churches served as hush harbors where slaves could worship in safety praise houses where their free descendants could gather and shout hallelujah rest stops for the weary along the Underground Railroad bunkers for the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement . They have been , and continue to be , community centers where we organize for jobs and justice places of scholarship and network places where children are loved and fed and kept out of harm s way , and told that they are beautiful and smart and taught that they matter . That is what happens in church . That is what the black church means . Our beating heart . The place where our dignity as a people is inviolate . When there is no better example of this tradition than Mother Emanuel a church built by blacks seeking liberty , burned to the ground because its founder sought to end slavery , only to rise up again , a Phoenix from these ashes . When there were laws banning all black church gatherings , services happened here anyway , in defiance of unjust laws . When there was a righteous movement to dismantle Jim Crow , Dr . Martin Luther King , Jr . preached from its pulpit , and marches began from its steps . A sacred place , this church . Not just for blacks , not just for Christians , but for every American who cares about the steady expansion of human rights and human dignity in this country a foundation stone for liberty and justice for all . That is what the church meant . We do not know whether the killer of Reverend Pinckney and eight others knew all of this history . But he surely sensed the meaning of his violent act . It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches , not random , but as a means of control , a way to terrorize and oppress . An act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination violence and suspicion . An act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation s original sin . Oh , but God works in mysterious ways . God has different ideas . He did not know he was being used by God . Blinded by hatred , the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle . The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court in the midst of unspeakable grief , with words of forgiveness . He could not imagine that . The alleged killer could not imagine how the city of Charleston , under the good and wise leadership of Mayor Riley how the state of South Carolina , how the United States of America would respond not merely with revulsion at his evil act , but with big hearted generosity and , more importantly , with a thoughtful introspection and self examination that we so rarely see in public life . Blinded by hatred , he failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood the power of God s grace . This whole week , I have been reflecting on this idea of grace . The grace of the families who lost loved ones . The grace that Reverend Pinckney would preach about in his sermons . The grace described in one of my favorite hymnals the one we all know Amazing grace , how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me . I once was lost , but now I am found was blind but now I see . According to the Christian tradition , grace is not earned . Grace is not merited . It is not something we deserve . Rather , grace is the free and benevolent favor of God as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings . Grace . As a nation , out of this terrible tragedy , God has visited grace upon us , for he has allowed us to see where we have been blind . He has given us the chance , where we have been lost , to find our best selves . We may not have earned it , this grace , with our rancor and complacency , and short sightedness and fear of each other but we got it all the same . He gave it to us anyway . He is once more given us grace . But it is up to us now to make the most of it , to receive it with gratitude , and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift . For too long , we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens . It is true , a flag did not cause these murders . But as people from all walks of life , Republicans and Democrats , now acknowledge including Governor Haley , whose recent eloquence on the subject is worthy of praise as we all have to acknowledge , the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride . For many , black and white , that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation . We see that now . Removing the flag from this state s capitol would not be an act of political correctness it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers . It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought the cause of slavery was wrong the imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War , the resistance to civil rights for all people was wrong . It would be one step in an honest accounting of America s history a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds . It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this state and this country for the better , because of the work of so many people of goodwill , people of all races striving to form a more perfect union . By taking down that flag , we express God s grace . But I do not think God wants us to stop there . For too long , we have been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present . Perhaps we see that now . Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty , or attend dilapidated schools , or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career . Perhaps it causes us to examine what we are doing to cause some of our children to hate . Perhaps it softens hearts towards those lost young men , tens and tens of thousands caught up in the criminal justice system and leads us to make sure that that system is not infected with bias that we embrace changes in how we train and equip our police so that the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve make us all safer and more secure . Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we do not realize it , so that we are guarding against not just racial slurs , but we are also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal . So that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote . By recognizing our common humanity by treating every child as important , regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born , and to do what is necessary to make opportunity real for every American by doing that , we express God s grace . For too long For too long , we have been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation . Sporadically , our eyes are open When eight of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement , 12 in a movie theater , 26 in an elementary school . But I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day the countless more whose lives are forever changed the survivors crippled , the children traumatized and fearful every day as they walk to school , the husband who will never feel his wife s warm touch , the entire communities whose grief overflows every time they have to watch what happened to them happen to some other place . The vast majority of Americans the majority of gun owners want to do something about this . We see that now . And I am convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others , even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country by making the moral choice to change , we express God s grace . We do not earn grace . We are all sinners . We do not deserve it . But God gives it to us anyway . And we choose how to receive it . It is our decision how to honor it . None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight . Every time something like this happens , somebody says we have to have a conversation about race . We talk a lot about race . There is no shortcut . And we do not need more talk . None of us should believe that a handful of gun safety measures will prevent every tragedy . It will not . People of goodwill will continue to debate the merits of various policies , as our democracy requires this is a big , raucous place , America is . And there are good people on both sides of these debates . Whatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete . But it would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for , I believe , if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again . Once the eulogies have been delivered , once the TV cameras move on , to go back to business as usual that is what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society . To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change that is how we lose our way again . It would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families if we merely slipped into old habits , whereby those who disagree with us are not merely wrong but bad where we shout instead of listen where we barricade ourselves behind preconceived notions or well practiced cynicism . Reverend Pinckney once said , Across the South , we have a deep appreciation of history we have not always had a deep appreciation of each other s history . What is true in the South is true for America . Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other . That my liberty depends on you being free , too . That history cannot be a sword to justify injustice , or a shield against progress , but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past how to break the cycle . A roadway toward a better world . He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind but , more importantly , an open heart . That is what I have felt this week an open heart . That , more than any particular policy or analysis , is what is called upon right now , I think what a friend of mine , the writer Marilyn Robinson , calls that reservoir of goodness , beyond , and of another kind , that we are able to do each other in the ordinary cause of things . That reservoir of goodness . If we can find that grace , anything is possible . If we can tap that grace , everything can change . Amazing grace . Amazing grace . Amazing grace how sweet the sound , that saved a wretch like me I once was lost , but now I am found was blind but now I see . Clementa Pinckney found that grace . Cynthia Hurd found that grace . Susie Jackson found that grace . Ethel Lance found that grace . DePayne Middleton Doctor found that grace . Tywanza Sanders found that grace . Daniel Simmons , Sr . found that grace . Sharonda Coleman Singleton found that grace . Myra Thompson found that grace . Through the example of their lives , they have now passed it on to us . May we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift , as long as our lives endure . May grace now lead them home . May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America .
