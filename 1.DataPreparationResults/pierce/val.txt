To the Senate and House of Representatives In returning to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , a bill entitled An act making appropriations for the repair , preservation , and completion of certain public works heretofore commenced under the authority of law , it became necessary for me , owing to the late day at which the bill was passed , to state my objections to it very briefly , announcing at the same time a purpose to resume the subject for more deliberate discussion at the present session of Congress for , while by no means insensible of the arduousness of the task thus undertaken by me , I conceived that the two Houses were entitled to an exposition of the considerations which had induced dissent on my part from their conclusions in this instance . The great constitutional question of the power of the General Government in relation to internal improvements has been the subject of earnest difference of opinion at every period of the history of the United States . Annual and special messages of successive Presidents have been occupied with it , sometimes in remarks on the general topic and frequently in objection to particular bills . The conflicting sentiments of eminent statesmen , expressed in Congress or in conventions called expressly to devise , if possible , some plan calculated to relieve the subject of the embarrassments with which it is environed , while they have directed public attention strongly to the magnitude of the interests involved , have yet left unsettled the limits , not merely of expediency , but of constitutional power , in relation to works of this class by the General Government . What is intended by the phrase internal improvements What does it embrace and what exclude No such language is found in the Constitution . Not only is it not an expression of ascertainable constitutional power , but it has no sufficient exactness of meaning to be of any value as the basis of a safe conclusion either of constitutional law or of practical statesmanship . President John Quincy Adams , in claiming on one occasion , after his retirement from office , the authorship of the idea of introducing into the administration of the affairs of the General Government a permanent and regular system of internal improvements , speaks of it as a system by which the whole Union would have been checkered over with railroads and canals , affording high wages and constant employment to hundreds of thousands of laborers and he places it in express contrast with the construction of such works by the legislation of the States and by private enterprise . It is quite obvious that if there be any constitutional power which authorizes the construction of railroads and canals by Congress , the same power must comprehend turnpikes and ordinary carriage roads nay , it must extend to the construction of bridges , to the draining of marshes , to the erection of levees , to the construction of canals of irrigation in a word , to all the possible means of the material improvement of the earth , by developing its natural resources anywhere and everywhere , even within the proper jurisdiction of the several States . But if there be any constitutional power thus comprehensive in its nature , must not the same power embrace within its scope other kinds of improvement of equal utility in themselves and equally important to the welfare of the whole country President Jefferson , while intimating the expediency of so amending the Constitution as to comprise objects of physical progress and well being , does not fail to perceive that other objects of public improvement , including public education by name , belong to the same class of powers . In fact , not only public instruction , but hospitals , establishments of science and art , libraries , and , indeed , everything appertaining to the internal welfare of the country , are just as much objects of internal improvement , or , in other words , of internal utility , as canals and railways . The admission of the power in either of its senses implies its existence in the other and since if it exists at all it involves dangerous augmentation of the political functions and of the patronage of the Federal Government , we ought to see clearly by what clause or clauses of the Constitution it is conferred . I have had occasion more than once to express , and deem it proper now to repeat , that it is , in my judgment , to be taken for granted , as a fundamental proposition not requiring elucidation , that the Federal Government is the creature of the individual States and of the people of the States severally that the sovereign power was in them alone that all the powers of the Federal Government are derivative ones , the enumeration and limitations of which are contained in the instrument which organized it and by express terms the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people . Starting from this foundation of our constitutional faith and proceeding to inquire in what part of the Constitution the power of making appropriations for internal improvements is found , it is necessary to reject all idea of there being any grant of power in the preamble . When that instrument says , We , the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , it only declares the inducements and the anticipated results of the things ordained and established by it . To assume that anything more can be designed by the language of the preamble would be to convert all the body of the Constitution , with its carefully weighed enumerations and limitations , into mere surplusage . The same may be said of the phrase in the grant of the power to Congress to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States or , to construe the words more exactly , they are not significant of grant or concession , but of restriction of the specific grants , having the effect of saying that in laying and collecting taxes for each of the precise objects of power granted to the General Government Congress must exercise any such definite and undoubted power in strict subordination to the purpose of the common defense and general welfare of all the States . There being no specific grant in the Constitution of a power to sanction appropriations for internal improvements , and no general provision broad enough to cover any such indefinite object , it becomes necessary to look for particular powers to which one or another of the things included in the phrase internal improvements may be referred . In the discussions of this question by the advocates of the organization of a general system of internal improvements under the auspices of the Federal Government , reliance is had for the justification of the measure on several of the powers expressly granted to Congress , such as to establish post offices and post roads , to declare war , to provide and maintain a navy , to raise and support armies , to regulate commerce , and to dispose of the territory and other public property of the United States . As to the last of these sources of power , that of disposing of the territory and other public property of the United States , it may be conceded that it authorizes Congress , in the management of the public property , to make improvements essential to the successful execution of the trust but this must be the primary object of any such improvement , and it would be an abuse of the trust to sacrifice the interest of the property to incidental purposes . As to the other assumed sources of a general power over internal improvements , they being specific powers of which this is supposed to be the incident , if the framers of the Constitution , wise and thoughtful men as they were , intended to confer on Congress the power over a subject so wide as the whole field of internal improvements , it is remarkable that they did not use language clearly to express it , or , in other words , that they did not give it as a distinct and substantive power instead of making it the implied incident of some other one for such is the magnitude of the supposed incidental power and its capacity of expansion that any system established under it would exceed each of the others in the amount of expenditure and number of the persons employed , which would thus be thrown upon the General Government . This position may be illustrated by taking as a single example one of the many things comprehended clearly in the idea of a general system of internal improvements , namely , roads . Let it be supposed that the power to construct roads over the whole Union , according to the suggestion of President Now there are in the United States , the results of State or private enterprise , upward of 17 , 000 miles of railroads and 5 , 000 miles of canals in all , 22 , 000 miles , the total cost of which may be estimated at little short of 600 , 000 , 000 and if the same works had been constructed by the Federal Government , supposing the thing to have been practicable , the cost would have probably been not less than 900 , 000 , 000 . The number of persons employed in superintending , managing , and keeping up these canals and railroads may be stated at 126 , 000 or thereabouts , to which are to be added 70 , 000 or 80 , 000 employed on the railroads in construction , making a total of at least 200 , 000 persons , representing in families nearly 1 , 000 , 000 souls , employed on or maintained by this one class of public works in the United States . In view of all this , it is not easy to estimate the disastrous consequences which must have resulted from such extended local improvements being undertaken by the General Government . State legislation upon this subject would have been suspended and private enterprise paralyzed , while applications for appropriations would have perverted the legislation of Congress , exhausted the National Treasury , and left the people burdened with a heavy public debt , beyond the capacity of generations to discharge . Is it conceivable that the framers of the Constitution intended that authority drawing after it such immense consequences should be inferred by implication as the incident of enumerated powers I can not think this , and the impossibility of supposing it would be still more glaring if similar calculations were carried out in regard to the numerous objects of material , moral , and political usefulness of which the idea of internal improvement admits . It may be safely inferred that if the framers of the Constitution had intended to confer the power to make appropriations for the objects indicated , it would have been enumerated among the grants expressly made to Congress . When , therefore , any one of the powers actually enumerated is adduced or referred to as the ground of an assumption to warrant the incidental or implied power of internal improvement , that hypothesis must be rejected , or at least can be no further admitted than as the particular act of internal improvement may happen to be necessary to the exercise of the granted power . Thus , when the object of a given road , the clearing of a particular channel , or the construction of a particular harbor of refuge is manifestly required by the exigencies of the naval or military service of the country , then it seems to me undeniable that it may be constitutionally comprehended in the powers to declare war , to provide and maintain a navy , and to raise and support armies . At the same time , it would be a misuse of these powers and a violation of the Constitution to undertake to build upon them a great system of internal improvements . And similar reasoning applies to the assumption of any such power as is involved in that to establish post roads and to regulate commerce . If the particular improvement , whether by land or sea , be necessary to the execution of the enumerated powers , then , but not otherwise , it falls within the jurisdiction of Congress . To this extent only can the power be claimed as the incident of any express grant to the Federal Government . But there is one clause of the Constitution in which it has been suggested that express authority to construct works of internal improvement has been conferred on Congress , namely , that which empowers it to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding 10 miles square as may by cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress become the seat of the Government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings . But any such supposition will be seen to be groundless when this provision is carefully examined and compared with other parts of the Constitution . It is undoubtedly true that like authority refers back to exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever as applied to the District of Columbia , and there is in the District no division of powers as between the General and the State Governments . In those places which the United States has purchased or retains within any of the States sites for dockyards or forts , for example legal process of the given State is still permitted to run for some purposes , and therefore the jurisdiction of the United States is not absolutely perfect . But let us assume for the argument s sake that the jurisdiction of the United States in a tract of land ceded to it for the purpose of a dockyard or fort by Virginia or Maryland is as complete as in that ceded by them for the seat of Government , and then proceed to analyze this clause of the Constitution . It provides that Congress shall have certain legislative authority over all places purchased by the United States for certain purposes . It implies that Congress has otherwise the power to purchase . But where does Congress get the power to purchase Manifestly it must be from some other clause of the Constitution , for it is not conferred by this one . Now , as it is a fundamental principle that the Constitution is one of limited powers , the authority to purchase must be conferred in one of the enumerations of legislative power so that the power to purchase is itself not an unlimited one , but is limited by the objects in regard to which legislative authority is directly conferred . The other expressions of the clause in question confirm this conclusion , since the jurisdiction is given as to places purchased for certain enumerated objects or purposes . Of these the first great division forts , magazines , arsenals , and dockyards is obviously referable to recognized heads of specific constitutional power . There remains only the phrase and other needful buildings . Wherefore needful Needful for any possible purpose within the whole range of the business of society and of Government Clearly not but only such buildings as are needful to the United States in the exercise of any of the powers conferred on Congress . Thus the United States need , in the exercise of admitted powers , not only forts , magazines , arsenals , and dockyards , but also court houses , prisons , custom houses , and post offices within the respective States . Places for the erection of such buildings the General Government may constitutionally purchase , and , having purchased them , the jurisdiction over them belongs to the United States . So if the General Government has the power to build a light house or a beacon , it may purchase a place for that object and having purchased it , then this clause of the Constitution gives jurisdiction over it . Still , the power to purchase for the purpose of erecting a light house or beacon must depend on the existence of the power to erect , and if that power exists it must be sought after in some other clause of the Constitution . From whatever point of view , therefore , the subject is regarded , whether as a question of express or implied power , the conclusion is the same , that Congress has no constitutional authority to carry on a system of internal improvements and in this conviction the system has been steadily opposed by the soundest expositors of the functions of the Government . It is not to be supposed that in no conceivable case shall there be doubt as to whether a given object be or not a necessary incident of the military , naval , or any other power . As man is imperfect , so are his methods of uttering his thoughts . Human language , save in expressions for the exact sciences , must always fail to preclude all possibility of controversy . Hence it is that in one branch of the subject the question of the power of Congress to make appropriations in aid of navigation there is less of positive conviction than in regard to the general subject and it therefore seems proper in this respect to revert to the history of the practice of the Government . Among the very earliest acts of the first session of Congress was that for the establishment and support of light houses , approved by President Washington on the 7th of August , 1789 , which contains the following provisions That all expenses which shall accrue from and after the 15th day of August , 1789 , in the necessary support , maintenance , and repairs of all light houses , beacons , buoys , and public piers erected , placed , or sunk before the passing of this act at the entrance of or within any bay , inlet , harbor , or port of the United States , for rendering the navigation thereof easy and safe , shall be defrayed out of the Treasury of the United States Provided , nevertheless , That none of the said expenses shall continue to be so defrayed after the expiration of one year from the day aforesaid unless such light houses , beacons , buoys , and public piers shall in the meantime be ceded to and vested in the United States by the State or States , respectively , in which the same may be , together with the lands and tenements thereunto belonging and together with the jurisdiction of the same . Acts containing appropriations for this class of public works were passed in 1791 , 1792 , 1793 , and so on from year to year down to the present time and the tenor of these acts , when examined with reference to other parts of the subject , is worthy of special consideration . It is a remarkable fact that for a period of more than thirty years after the adoption of the Constitution all appropriations of this class were confined , with scarcely an apparent exception , to the construction of light houses , beacons , buoys , and public piers and the stakage of channels to render navigation safe and easy , it is true , but only by indicating to the navigator obstacles in his way , not by removing those obstacles nor in any other respect changing , artificially , the preexisting natural condition of the earth and sea . It is obvious , however , that works of art for the removal of natural impediments to navigation , or to prevent their formation , or for supplying harbors where these do not exist , are also means of rendering navigation safe and easy , and may in supposable cases be the most efficient , as well as the most economical , of such means . Nevertheless , it is not until the year 1824 that in an act to improve the navigation of the rivers Ohio and Mississippi and in another act making appropriations for deepening the channel leading into the harbor of Presque Isle , on Lake Erie , and for repairing Plymouth Beach , in Massachusetts Bay , we have any example of an appropriation for the improvement of harbors in the nature of those provided for in the bill returned by me to the House of Representatives . It appears not probable that the abstinence of Congress in this respect is attributable altogether to considerations of economy or to any failure to perceive that the removal of an obstacle to navigation might be not less useful than the indication of it for avoidance , and it may be well assumed that the course of legislation so long pursued was induced , in whole or in part , by solicitous consideration in regard to the constitutional power over such matters vested in Congress . One other peculiarity in this course of legislation is not less remarkable . It is that when the General Government first took charge of lighthouses and beacons it required the works themselves and the lands on which they were situated to be ceded to the United States . And although for a time this precaution was neglected in the case of new works , in the sequel it was provided by general laws that no light house should be constructed on any site previous to the jurisdiction over the same being ceded to the United States . Constitutional authority for the construction and support of many of the public works of this nature , it is certain , may be found in the power of Congress to maintain a navy and provide for the general defense but their number , and in many instances their location , preclude the idea of their being fully justified as necessary and proper incidents of that power . And they do not seem susceptible of being referred to any other of the specific powers vested in Congress by the Constitution , unless it be that to raise revenue in so far as this relates to navigation . The practice under all my predecessors in office , the express admissions of some of them , and absence of denial by any sufficiently manifest their belief that the power to erect light houses , beacons , and piers is possessed by the General Government . In the acts of Congress , as we have already seen , the inducement and object of the appropriations are expressly declared , those appropriations being for light houses , beacons , buoys , and public piers erected or placed within any bay , inlet , harbor , or port of the United States for rendering the navigation thereof easy and safe . If it be contended that this review of the history of appropriations of this class leads to the inference that , beyond the purposes of national defense and maintenance of a navy , there is authority in the Constitution to construct certain works in aid of navigation , it is at the same time to be remembered that the conclusions thus deduced from contemporaneous construction and long continued acquiescence are themselves directly suggestive of limitations of constitutionality , as well as expediency , regarding the nature and the description of those aids to navigation which Congress may provide as incident to the revenue power for at this point controversy begins , not so much as to the principle as to its application . In accordance with long established legislative usage , Congress may construct light houses and beacons and provide , as it does , other means to prevent shipwrecks on the coasts of the United States . But the General Government can not go beyond this and make improvements of rivers and harbors of the nature and to the degree of all the provisions of the bill of the last session of Congress . To justify such extended power , it has been urged that if it be constitutional to appropriate money for the purpose of pointing out , by the construction of light houses or beacons , where an obstacle to navigation exists , it is equally so to remove such obstacle or to avoid it by the creation of an artificial channel that if the object be lawful , then the means adopted solely with reference to the end must be lawful , and that therefore it is not material , constitutionally speaking , whether a given obstruction to navigation be indicated for avoidance or be actually avoided by excavating a new channel that if it be a legitimate object of expenditure to preserve a ship from wreck by means of a beacon or of revenue cutters , it must be not less so to provide places of safety by the improvement of harbors , or , where none exist , by their artificial construction and thence the argument naturally passes to the propriety of improving rivers for the benefit of internal navigation , because all these objects are of more or less importance to the commercial as well as the naval interests of the United States . The answer to all this is that the question of opening speedy and easy communication to and through all parts of the country is substantially the same , whether done by land or water that the uses of roads and canals in facilitating commercial intercourse and uniting by community of interests the most remote quarters of the country by land communication are the same in their nature as the uses of navigable waters and that therefore the question of the facilities and aids to be provided to navigation , by whatsoever means , is but a subdivision of the great question of the constitutionality and expediency of internal improvements by the General Government . In confirmation of this it is to be remarked that one of the most important acts of appropriation of this class , that of the year 1833 , under the Administration of President Jackson , by including together and providing for in one bill as well river and harbor works as road works , impliedly recognizes the fact that they are alike branches of the same great subject of internal improvements . As the population , territory , and wealth of the country increased and settlements extended into remote regions , the necessity for additional means of communication impressed itself upon all minds with a force which had not been experienced at the date of the formation of the Constitution , and more and more embarrassed those who were most anxious to abstain scrupulously from any exercise of doubtful power . Hence the recognition in the messages of Presidents Jefferson , Madison , and Monroe of the eminent desirableness of such works , with admission that some of them could lawfully and should be conducted by the General Government , but with obvious uncertainty of opinion as to the line between such as are constitutional and such as are not , such as ought to receive appropriations from Congress and such as ought to be consigned to private enterprise or the legislation of the several States . This uncertainty has not been removed by the practical working of our institutions in later times for although the acquisition of additional territory and the application of steam to the propulsion of vessels have greatly magnified the importance of internal commerce , this fact has at the same time complicated the question of the power of the General Government over the present subject . In fine , a careful review of the opinions of all my predecessors and of the legislative history of the country does not indicate any fixed rule by which to decide what , of the infinite variety of possible river and harbor improvements , are within the scope of the power delegated by the Constitution and the question still remains unsettled . President Jackson conceded the constitutionality , under suitable circumstances , of the improvement of rivers and harbors through the agency of Congress , and President Polk admitted the propriety of the establishment and support by appropriations from the Treasury of light houses , beacons , buoys , and other improvements within the bays , inlets , and harbors of the ocean and lake coasts immediately connected with foreign commerce . But if the distinction thus made rests upon the differences between foreign and domestic commerce it can not be restricted thereby to the bays , inlets , and harbors of the oceans and lakes , because foreign commerce has already penetrated thousands of miles into the interior of the continent by means of our great rivers , and will continue so to extend itself with the progress of settlement until it reaches the limit of navigability . At the time of the adoption of the Constitution the vast Valley of the Mississippi , now teeming with population and supplying almost boundless resources , was literally an unexplored wilderness . Our advancement has outstripped even the most sanguine anticipations of the fathers of the Republic , and it illustrates the fact that no rule is admissible which undertakes to discriminate , so far as regards river and harbor improvements , between the Atlantic or Pacific coasts and the great lakes and rivers of the interior regions of North America . Indeed , it is quite erroneous to suppose that any such discrimination has ever existed in the practice of the Government . To the contrary of which is the significant fact , before stated , that when , after abstaining from all such appropriations for more than thirty years , Congress entered upon the policy of improving the navigation of rivers and harbors , it commenced with the rivers Mississippi and Ohio . The Congress of the Union , adopting in this respect one of the ideas of that of the Confederation , has taken heed to declare from time to time , as occasion required , either in acts for disposing of the public lands in the Territories or in acts for admitting new States , that all navigable rivers within the same shall be deemed to be and remain public highways . Out of this condition of things arose a question which at successive periods of our public annals has occupied the attention of the best minds in the Union . This question is , What waters are public navigable waters , so as not to be of State character and jurisdiction , but of Federal jurisdiction and character , in the intent of the Constitution and of Congress A proximate , but imperfect , answer to this important question is furnished by the acts of Congress and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States defining the constitutional limits of the maritime jurisdiction of the General Government . That jurisdiction is entirely independent of the revenue power . It is not derived from that , nor is it measured thereby . In that act of Congress which , in the first year of the Government , organized our judicial system , and which , whether we look to the subject , the comprehensive wisdom with which it was treated , or the deference with which its provisions have come to be regarded , is only second to the Constitution itself , there is a section in which the statesmen who framed the Constitution have placed on record their construction of it in this matte , . . It enacts that the district courts of the United States shall have exclusive cognizance of all civil cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction , including all seizures under the law of impost , navigation , or trade of the United States , when the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of 10 or more tons burden , within their respective districts , as well as upon the high seas . In this contemporaneous exposition of the Constitution there is no trace or suggestion that nationality of jurisdiction is limited to the sea , or even to tide waters . The law is marked by a sagacious apprehension of the fact that the Great Lakes and the Mississippi were navigable waters of the United States even then , before the acquisition of Louisiana had made wholly our own the territorial greatness of the West . It repudiates unequivocally the rule of the common law , according to which the question of whether a water is public navigable water or not depends on whether it is salt or not , and therefore , in a river , confines that quality to tide water a rule resulting from the geographical condition of England and applicable to an island with small and narrow streams , the only navigable portion of which , for ships , is in immediate contact with the ocean , but wholly inapplicable to the great inland fresh water seas of America and its mighty rivers , with secondary branches exceeding in magnitude the largest rivers of Great Britain . At a later period it is true that , in disregard of the more comprehensive definition of navigability afforded by that act of Congress , it was for a time held by many that the rule established for England was to be received in the United States , the effect of which was to exclude from the jurisdiction of the General Government not only the waters of the Mississippi , but also those of the Great Lakes . To this construction it was with truth objected that , in so far as concerns the lakes , they are in fact seas , although of fresh water that they are the natural marine communications between a series of populous States and between them and the possessions of a foreign nation that they are actually navigated by ships of commerce of the largest capacity that they had once been and might again be the scene of foreign war and that therefore it was doing violence to all reason to undertake by means of an arbitrary doctrine of technical foreign law to exclude such waters from the jurisdiction of the General Government . In regard to the river Mississippi , it was objected that to draw a line across that river at the point of ebb and flood of tide , and say that the part below was public navigable water and the part above not , while in the latter the water was at least equally deep and navigable and its commerce as rich as in the former , with numerous ports of foreign entry and delivery , was to sanction a distinction artificial and unjust , because regardless of the real fact of navigability . We may conceive that some such considerations led to the enactment in the year 1845 of an act in addition to that of 1789 , declaring that The district courts of the United States shall have , possess , and exercise the same jurisdiction in matters of contract and tort arising in , upon , or concerning steamboats and other vessels of 20 tons burden and upward , enrolled and licensed for the coasting trade and at the time employed in business of commerce and navigation between ports and places in different States and Territories upon the lakes and navigable waters connecting said lakes , as is now possessed and exercised by the said courts in cases of the like steamboats and other vessels employed in navigation and commerce upon the high seas or tide waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States . It is observable that the act of 1789 applies the jurisdiction of the United States to all waters which are navigable from the sea for vessels of 10 tons burden , and that of 1845 extends the jurisdiction to enrolled vessels of 20 tons burden , on the lakes and navigable waters connecting said lakes , though not waters navigable from the sea , provided such vessels be employed between places in different States and Territories . Thus it appears that these provisions of law in effect prescribe conditions by which to determine whether any waters are public navigable waters , subject to the authority of the Federal Government . The conditions include all waters , whether salt or fresh , and whether of sea , lake , or river , provided they be capable of navigation by vessels of a certain tonnage , and for commerce either between the United States and foreign countries or between any two or more of the States or Territories of the Union . This excludes water wholly within any particular State , and not used as the means of commercial communication with any other State , and subject to be improved or obstructed at will by the State within which it may happen to be . The constitutionality of these provisions of statute has been called in question . Their constitutionality has been maintained , however , by repeated decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States , and they are therefore the law of the land by the concurrent act of the legislative , the executive , and the judicial departments of the Government . Regarded as affording a criterion of what is navigable water , and as such subject to the maritime jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and of Congress , these acts are objectionable in this , that the rule of navigability is an arbitrary one , that Congress may repeal the present rule and adopt a new one , and that thus a legislative definition will be able to restrict or enlarge the limits of constitutional power . Yet this variableness of standard seems inherent in the nature of things . At any rate , neither the First Congress , composed of the statesmen of the era when the Constitution was adopted , nor any subsequent Congress has afforded us the means of attaining greater precision of construction as to this part of the Constitution . This reflection may serve to relieve from undeserved reproach an idea of one of the greatest men of the Republic President Jackson . He , seeking amid all the difficulties of the subject for some practical rule of action in regard to appropriations for the improvement of rivers and harbors , prescribed for his own official conduct the rule of confining such appropriations to places below the ports of entry or delivery established by law . He saw clearly , as the authors of the above mentioned acts of 1789 and 1845 did , that there is no inflexible natural line of discrimination between what is national and what local by means of which to determine absolutely and unerringly at what point on a river the jurisdiction of the United States shall end . He perceived , and of course admitted , that the Constitution , while conferring on the General Government some power of action to render navigation safe and easy , had of necessity left to Congress much of discretion in this matter . He confided in the patriotism of Congress to exercise that discretion wisely , not permitting himself to suppose it possible that a port of entry or delivery would ever be established by law for the express and only purpose of evading the Constitution . It remains , therefore , to consider the question of the measure of discretion in the exercise by Congress of the power to provide for the improvement of rivers and harbors , and also that of the legitimate responsibility of the Executive in the same relation . In matters of legislation of the most unquestionable constitutionality it is always material to consider what amount of public money shall be appropriated for any particular object . The same consideration applies with augmented force to a class of appropriations which are in their nature peculiarly prone to run to excess , and which , being made in the exercise of incidental powers , have intrinsic tendency to overstep the bounds of constitutionality . If an appropriation for improving the navigability of a river or deepening or protecting a harbor have reference to military or naval purposes , then its rightfulness , whether in amount or in the objects to which it is applied , depends , manifestly , on the military or naval exigency and the subject matter affords its own measure of legislative discretion . But if the appropriation for such an object have no distinct relation to the military or naval wants of the country , and is wholly , or even mainly , intended to promote the revenue from commerce , then the very vagueness of the proposed purpose of the expenditure constitutes a perpetual admonition of reserve and caution . Through disregard of this it is undeniable that in many cases appropriations of this nature have been made unwisely , without accomplishing beneficial results commensurate with the cost , and sometimes for evil rather than good , independently of their dubious relation to the Constitution . Among the radical changes of the course of legislation in these matters which , in my judgment , the public interest demands , one is a return to the primitive idea of Congress , which required in this class of public works , as in all others , a conveyance of the soil and a cession of the jurisdiction to the United States . I think this condition ought never to have been waived in the case of any harbor improvement of a permanent nature , as where piers , jetties , sea walls , and other like works are to be constructed and maintained . It would powerfully tend to counteract endeavors to obtain appropriations of a local character and chiefly calculated to promote individual interests . The want of such a provision is the occasion of abuses in regard to existing works , exposing them to private encroachment without sufficient means of redress by law . Indeed , the absence in such cases of a cession of jurisdiction has constituted one of the constitutional objections to appropriations of this class . It is not easy to perceive any sufficient reason for requiring it in the case of arsenals or forts which does not equally apply to all other public works . If to be constructed and maintained by Congress in the exercise of a constitutional power of appropriation , they should be brought within the jurisdiction of the United States . There is another measure of precaution in regard to such appropriations which seems to me to be worthy of the consideration of Congress . It is to make appropriation for every work in a separate bill , so that each one shall stand on its own independent merits , and if it pass shall do so under circumstances of legislative scrutiny entitling it to be regarded as of general interest and a proper subject of charge on the Treasury of the Union . During that period of time in which the country had not come to look to Congress for appropriations of this nature several of the States whose productions or geographical position invited foreign commerce had entered upon plans for the improvement of their harbors by themselves and through means of support drawn directly from that commerce , in virtue of an express constitutional power , needing for its exercise only the permission of Congress . Harbor improvements thus constructed and maintained , the expenditures upon them being defrayed by the very facilities they afford , are a voluntary charge on those only who see fit to avail themselves of such facilities , and can be justly complained of by none . On the other hand , so long as these improvements are carried on by appropriations from the Treasury the benefits will continue to inure to those alone who enjoy the facilities afforded , while the expenditure will be a burden upon the whole country and the discrimination a double injury to places equally requiring improvement , but not equally favored by appropriations . These considerations , added to the embarrassments of the whole question , amply suffice to suggest the policy of confining appropriations by the General Government to works necessary to the execution of its undoubted powers and of leaving all others to individual enterprise or to the separate States , to be provided for out of their own resources or by recurrence to the provision of the Constitution which authorizes the States to lay duties of tonnage with the consent of Congress .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I hasten to respond briefly to the resolution of the Senate of this date , requesting the President to inform the Senate , if in his opinion it be not incompatible with the public interest , whether anything has arisen since the date of his message to the House of Representatives of the 15th of March last concerning our relations with the Government of Spain which in his opinion may dispense with the suggestions therein contained touching the propriety of provisional measures by Congress to meet any exigency that may arise in the recess of Congress affecting those relations . In the message to the House of Representatives referred to I availed myself of the occasion to present the following reflections and suggestions In view of the position of the island of Cuba , its proximity to our coast , the relations which it must ever bear to our commercial and other interests , it is vain to expect that a series of unfriendly acts infringing our commercial rights and the adoption of a policy threatening the honor and security of these States can long consist with peaceful relations . In case the measures taken for amicable adjustment of our difficulties with Spain should , unfortunately , fail , I shall not hesitate to use the authority and means which Congress may grant to insure the observance of our just rights , to obtain redress for injuries received , and to vindicate the honor of our flag . In anticipation of that contingency , which I earnestly hope may not arise , I suggest to Congress the propriety of adopting such provisional measures as the exigency may seem to demand . The two Houses of Congress may have anticipated that the hope then expressed would be realized before the period of its adjournment , and that our relations with Spain would have assumed a satisfactory condition , so as to remove past causes of complaint and afford better security for tranquillity and justice in the future . But I am constrained to say that such is not the fact . The formal demand for immediate reparation in the case of the Black Warrior , instead of having been met on the part of Spain by prompt satisfaction , has only served to call forth a justification of the local authorities of Cuba , and thus to transfer the responsibility for their acts to the Spanish Government itself . Meanwhile information , not only reliable in its nature , but of an official character , was received to the effect that preparation was making within the limits of the United States by private individuals under military organization for a descent upon the island of Cuba with a view to wrest that colony from the dominion of Spain . International comity , the obligations of treaties , and the express provisions of law alike required , in my judgment , that all the constitutional power of the Executive should be exerted to prevent the consummation of such a violation of positive law and of that good faith on which mainly the amicable relations of neighboring nations must depend . In conformity with these convictions of public duty , a proclamation was issued to warn all persons not to participate in the contemplated enterprise and to invoke the interposition in this behalf of the proper officers of the Government . No provocation whatever can justify private expeditions of hostility against a country at peace with the United States . The power to declare war is vested by the Constitution in Congress , and the experience of our past history leaves no room to doubt that the wisdom of this arrangement of constitutional power will continue to be verified whenever the national interest and honor shall demand a resort to ultimate measures of redress . Pending negotiations by the Executive , and before the action of Congress , individuals could not be permitted to embarrass the operations of the one and usurp the powers of the other of these depositaries of the functions of Government . I have only to add that nothing has arisen since the date of my former message to dispense with the suggestions therein contained touching the propriety of provisional measures by Congress .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The Constitution of the United States provides that Congress shall assemble annually on the first Monday of December , and it has been usual for the President to make no communication of a public character to the Senate and House of Representatives until advised of their readiness to receive it . I have deferred to this usage until the close of the first month of the session , but my convictions of duty will not permit me longer to postpone the discharge of the obligation enjoined by the Constitution upon the President to give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . It is matter of congratulation that the Republic is tranquilly advancing in a career of prosperity and peace . Whilst relations of amity continue to exist between the United States and all foreign powers , with some of them grave questions are depending which may require the consideration of Congress . Of such questions , the most important is that which has arisen out of the negotiations with Great Britain in reference to Central America . By the convention concluded between the two Governments on the 19th of April , 1850 , both parties covenanted that neither will ever occupy , or fortify , or colonize , or assume or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua . Costa Rica , the Mosquito Coast , or any part of Central America . It was the undoubted understanding of the United States in making this treaty that all the present States of the former Republic of Central America and the entire territory of each would thenceforth enjoy complete independence , and that both contracting parties engaged equally and to the same extent , for the present and , for the future , that if either then had any claim of right in Central America such claim and all occupation or authority under it were unreservedly relinquished by the stipulations of the convention , and that no dominion was thereafter to be exercised or assumed in any part of Central America by Great Britain or the United States . This Government consented to restrictions in regard to a region of country wherein we had specific and peculiar interests only upon the conviction that the like restrictions were in the same sense obligatory on Great Britain . But for this understanding of the force and effect of the convention it would never have been concluded by us . So clear was this understanding on the part of the United States that in correspondence contemporaneous with the ratification of the convention it was distinctly expressed that the mutual covenants of nonoccupation were not intended to apply to the British establishment at the Balize . This qualification is to be ascribed to the fact that , in virtue of successive treaties with previous sovereigns of the country , Great Britain had obtained a concession of the right to cut mahogany or dyewoods at the Balize , but with positive exclusion of all domain or sovereignty and thus it confirms the natural construction and understood import of the treaty as to all the rest of the region to which the stipulations applied . It , however , became apparent at an early day after entering upon the discharge of my present functions that Great Britain still continued in the exercise or assertion of large authority in all that part of Central America commonly called the Mosquito Coast , and covering the entire length of the State of Nicaragua and a part of Costa Rica that she regarded the Balize as her absolute domain and was gradually extending its limits at the expense of the State of Honduras , and , that she had formally colonized a considerable insular group known as the Bay Islands , and belonging of right to that State . All these acts or pretensions of Great Britain , being contrary to the rights of the States of Central America and to the manifest tenor of her stipulations with the United States as understood by this Government , have been made the subject of negotiation through the American minister in London . I transmit herewith the instructions to him on the subject and the correspondence between him and the British secretary for foreign affairs , by which you will perceive that the two Governments differ widely and irreconcilably as to the construction of the convention and its effect on their respective relations to Central America . Great Britain so construes the convention as to maintain unchanged all her previous pretensions over the Mosquito Coast and in different parts of Central America . These pretensions as to the Mosquito Coast are founded on the assumption of political relation between Great Britain and the remnant of a tribe of Indians on that coast , entered into at a time when the whole country was a colonial possession of Spain . It can not be successfully controverted that by the public law of Europe and America no possible act of such Indians or their predecessors could confer on Great Britain any political rights . Great Britain does not allege the assent of Spain as the origin of her claims on the Mosquito Coast . She has , on the contrary , by repeated and successive treaties renounced and relinquished all pretensions of her own and recognized the full and sovereign rights of Spain in the most unequivocal terms . Yet these pretensions , so without solid foundation in the beginning and thus repeatedly abjured , were at a recent period revived by Great Britain against the Central American States , the legitimate successors to all the ancient jurisdiction of Spain in that region . They were first applied only to a defined part of the coast of Nicaragua , afterwards to the whole of its Atlantic coast , and lastly to a part of the coast of Costa Rica , and they are now reasserted to this extent notwithstanding engagements to the United States . On the eastern coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica the interference of Great Britain , though exerted at one time in the form of military occupation of the port of San Juan del Norte , then in the peaceful possession of the appropriate authorities of the Central American States , is now presented by her as the rightful exercise of a protectorship over the Mosqttito tribe of Indians . But the establishment at the Balize , now reaching far beyond its treaty limits into the State of Honduras , and that of the Bay Islands , appertaining of right to the same State , are as distinctly colonial governments as those of Jamaica or Canada , and therefore contrary to the very letter , as well as the spirit , of the convention with the United States as it was at the time of ratification and now is understood by this Government . The interpretation which the British Government thus , in assertion and act , persists in ascribing to the convention entirely changes its character . While it holds us to all our obligations , it in a great measure releases Great Britain from those which constituted the consideration of this Government for entering into the convention . It is impossible , in my judgment , for the United States to acquiesce in such a construction of the respective relations of the two Governments to Central America . To a renewed call by this Government upon Great Britain to abide by and Carry into effect the stipulations of the convention according to its obvious import by withdrawing from the possession or colonization of portions of the Central American States of Honduras , Nicaragua , and Costa Rica , the British Government has at length replied , affirming that the operation of the treaty is prospective only and did not require Great Britain to abandon or contract any possessions held by her in Central America at the date of its conclusion . This reply substitutes a partial issue in the place of the general one presented by the United States . The British Government passes over the question of the rights of Great Britain , real or supposed , in Central America , and assumes that she had such rights at the date of the treaty and that those rights comprehended the protectorship of the Mosquito Indians , the extended jurisdiction and limits of the Balize , and the colony of the Bay Islands , and thereupon proceeds by implication to infer that if the stipulations of the treaty be merely future in effect Great Britain may still continue to hold the contested portions of Central America . The United States can not admit either the inference or the premises . We steadily deny that at the date of the treaty Great Britain had any possessions there other than the limited and peculiar establishment at the Balize , and maintain that if she had any they were surrendered by the convention . This Government , recognizing the obligations of the treaty , has , of course , desired to see it executed in good faith by both parties , and in the discussion , therefore , has not looked to rights which we might assert independently of the treaty in consideration of our geographical position and of other circumstances which create for us relations to the Central American States different from those of any government of Europe . The British Government , in its last communication , although well knowing the views of the United States , still declares that it sees no reason why a conciliatory spirit may not enable the two Governments to overcome all obstacles to a satisfactory adjustment of the subject . Assured of the correctness of the construction of the treaty constantly adhered to by this Government and resolved to insist on the rights of the United States , yet actuated also by the same desire which is avowed by the British Government , to remove all causes of serious misunderstanding between two nations associated by so many ties of interest and kindred , it has appeared to me proper not to consider an amicable solution of the controversy hopeless . There is , however , reason to apprehend that with Great Britain in the actual occupation of the disputed territories , and the treaty therefore practically null so far as regards our rights , this international difficulty can not long remain undetermined without involving in serious danger the friendly relations which it is the interest as well as the duty of both countries to cherish and preserve . It will afford me sincere gratification if future efforts shall result in the success anticipated heretofore with more confidence than the aspect of the case permits me now to entertain . One other subject of discussion between the United States and Great Britain has grown out of the attempt , which the exigencies of the war in which she is engaged with Russia induced her to make , to draw recruits from the United States . It is the traditional and settled policy of the United States to maintain impartial neutrality during the wars which from time to time occur among the great powers of the world . Performing all the duties of neutrality toward the respective belligerent states , we may reasonably expect them not to interfere with our lawful enjoyment of its benefits . Notwithstanding the existence of such hostilities , our citizens retained the individual right to continue all their accustomed pursuits , by land or by sea , at home or abroad , subject only to such restrictions in this relation as the laws of war , the usage of nations , or special treaties may impose and it is our sovereign right that our territory and jurisdiction shall not be invaded by either of the belligerent parties for the transit of their armies , the operations of their fleets , the levy of troops for their service , the fitting out of cruisers by or against either , or any other act or incident of war . And these undeniable rights of neutrality , individual and national , the United States will under no circumstances surrender . In pursuance of this policy , the laws of the United States do not forbid their citizens to sell to either of the belligerent powers articles contraband of war or take munitions of war or soldiers on board their private ships for transportation and although in so doing the individual citizen exposes his property or person to some of the hazards of war , his acts do not involve any breach of national neutrality nor of themselves implicate the Government . Thus , during the progress of the present war in Europe , our citizens have , without national responsibility therefor , sold gunpowder and arms to all buyers , regardless of the destination of those articles . Our merchantmen have been , and still continue to be , largely employed by Great Britain and by France in transporting troops , provisions , and munitions of war to the principal seat of military operations and in bringing home their sick and wounded soldiers but such use of our mercantile marine is not interdicted either by the international or by our municipal law , and therefore does not compromise our neutral relations with Russia . But our municipal law , in accordance with the law of nations , peremptorily forbids not only foreigners , but our own citizens , to fit out within the United States a vessel to commit hostilities against any state with which the United States are at peace , or to increase the force of any foreign armed vessel intended for such hostilities against a friendly state . Whatever concern may have been felt by either of the belligerent powers lest private armed cruisers or other vessels in the service of one might be fitted out in the ports of this country to depredate on the property of the other , all such fears have proved to be utterly groundless . Our citizens have been withheld from any such act or purpose by good faith and by respect for the law . While the laws of the Union are thus peremptory in their prohibition of the equipment or armament of belligerent cruisers in our ports , they provide not less absolutely that no person shall , within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States , enlist or enter himself , or hire or retain another person to enlist or enter himself , or to go beyond the limits or jurisdiction of the United States with intent to be enlisted or entered , in the service of any foreign state , either as a soldier or as a marine or seaman on board of any vessel of war , letter of marque , or privateer . And these enactments are also in strict conformity with the law of nations , which declares that no state has the right to raise troops for land or sea service in another state without its consent , and that , whether forbidden by the municipal law or not , the very attempt to do it without such consent is an attack on the national sovereignty . Such being the public rights and the municipal law of the United States , no solicitude on the subject was entertained by this Government when , a year since , the British Parliament passed an act to provide for the enlistment of foreigners in the military service of Great Britain . Nothing on the face of the act or in its public history indicated that the British Government proposed to attempt recruitment in the United States , nor did it ever give intimation of such intention to this Government . It was matter of surprise , therefore , to find subsequently that the engagement of persons within the United States to proceed to Halifax , in the British Province of Nova Scotia , and there enlist in the service of Great Britain , was going on extensively , with little or no disguise . Ordinary legal steps were immediately taken to arrest and punish parties concerned , and so put an end to acts infringing the municipal law and derogatory to our sovereignty . Meanwhile suitable representations on the subject were addressed to the British Government . Thereupon it became known , by the admission of the British Government itself , that the attempt to draw recruits from this country originated with it , or at least had its approval and sanction but it also appeared that the public agents engaged in it bad stringent instructions not to violate the municipal law of the United States . It is difficult to understand how it should have been supposed that troops could be raised here by Great Britain without violation of the municipal law . The unmistakable object of the law was to prevent every such act which if performed must be either in violation of the law or in studied evasion of it , and in either alternative the act done would be alike injurious to the sovereignty of the United States . In the meantime the matter acquired additional importance by the recruitments in the United States not being discontinued , and the disclosure of the fact that they were prosecuted upon a systematic plan devised by official authority that recruiting rendezvous had been opened in our principal cities and depots for the reception of recruits established on our frontier , and the whole business conducted under the supervision and by the regular cooperation of British officers , civil and military , some in the North American Provinces and some in the United States . The complicity of those officers in an undertaking which could only be accomplished by defying our laws , throwing suspicion over our attitude of neutrality , and disregarding our territorial rights is conclusively proved by the evidence elicited on the trial of such of their agents as have been apprehended and convicted . Some of the officers thus implicated are of high official position , and many of them beyond our jurisdiction , so that legal proceedings could not reach the source of the mischief . These considerations , and the fact that the cause of complaint was not a mere casual occurrence , trot a deliberate design , entered upon with full knowledge of our laws and national policy and conducted by responsible public functionaries , impelled me to present the case to the British Government , in order to secure not only a cessation of the , wrong , but its reparation . The subject is still under discussion , the result of which will be communicated to you in due time . I repeat the recommendation submitted to the last Congress , that provision be made for the appointment of a commissioner , in connection with Great Britain , to survey and establish the boundary line which divides the Territory of Washington from the contiguous British possessions . By reason of the extent and importance of the country in dispute , there has been imminent danger of collision between the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States , including their respective authorities , in that quarter . The prospect of a speedy arrangement has contributed hitherto to induce on both sides forbearance to assert by force what each claims as a right . Continuance of delay on the part of the two Governments to act in the matter will increase the dangers and difficulties of the controversy . Misunderstanding exists as to the extent , character , and value of the possessory rights of the Hudsons Bay Company and the property of the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company reserved in our treaty with Great Britain relative to the Territory of Oregon . I have reason to believe that a cession of the rights of both companies to the United States , which would be the readiest means of terminating all questions , can be obtained on reasonable terms , and with a view to this end I present the subject to the attention of Congress . The colony of Newfoundland , having enacted the laws required by the treaty of the 5th of June , 1854 , is now placed on the same footing in respect to commercial intercourse with the United States as the other British North American Provinces . The commission which that treaty contemplated , for determining the rights of fishery in rivers and mouths of rivers on the coasts of the United States and the British North American Provinces , has been organized , and has commenced its labors , to complete which there are needed further appropriations for the service of another season . In pursuance of the authority conferred by a resolution of the Senate of the United States passed on the 3d of March last , notice was given to Denmark on the 14th day of April of the intention of this Government to avail itself of the stipulation of the subsisting convention of friendship , commerce , and navigation between that Kingdom and the United States whereby either party might after ten years terminate the same at the expiration of one year from the date of notice for that purpose . The considerations which led me to call the attention of Congress to that convention and induced the Senate to adopt the resolution referred to still continue in full force . The convention contains an article which , although it does not directly engage the United States to submit to the imposition of tolls on the vessels and cargoes of Americans passing into or from the Baltic Sea during the continuance of the treaty , yet may by possibility be construed as implying such submission . The exaction of those tolls not being justified by any principle of international law , it became the right and duty of the United States to relieve themselves from the implication of engagement on the subject , so as to be perfectly free to act in the premises in such way as their public interests and honor shall demand . I remain of the opinion that the United States ought not to submit to the payment of the Sound dues , not so much because of their amount , which is a secondary matter , but because it is in effect the recognition of the right of Denmark to treat one of the great maritime highways of nations as a close sea , and prevent the navigation of it as a privilege , for which tribute may be imposed upon those who have occasion to use it . This Government on a former occasion , not unlike the present , signalized its determination to maintain the freedom of the seas and of the great natural channels of navigation . The Barbary States had for a long time coerced the payment of tribute from all nations whose ships frequented the Mediterranean . To the last demand of such payment made by them the United States , although suffering less by their depredations than many other nations , returned the explicit answer that we preferred war to tribute , and thus opened the way to the relief of the commerce of the world from an ignominious tax , so long submitted to by the more powerful nations of Europe . If the manner of payment of the Sound dues differ from that of the tribute formerly conceded to the Barbary States , still their exaction by Denmark has no better foundation in right . Each was in its origin nothing but a tax on a common natural right , extorted by those who were at that time able to obstruct the free and secure enjoyment of it , but who no longer possess that power . Denmark , while resisting our assertion of the freedom of the Baltic Sound and Belts , has indicated a readiness to make some new arrangement on the subject , and has invited the governments interested , including the United States , to be represented in a convention to assemble for the purpose of receiving and considering a proposition which she intends to submit for the capitalization of the Sound dues and the distribution of the sum to be paid as commutation among the governments according to the respective proportions of their maritime commerce to and from the Baltic . I have declined , in behalf of the United States , to accept this invitation , for the most cogent reasons . One is that Denmark does not offer to submit to the convention the question of her right to levy the Sound dues . The second is that if the convention were allowed to take cognizance of that particular question , still it would not be competent to deal with the great international principle involved , which affects the right in other cases of navigation and commercial freedom , as well as that of access to the Baltic . Above all , by the express terms of the proposition it is contemplated that the consideration of the Sound dues shall be commingled with and made subordinate to a matter wholly extraneous the balance of power among the Governments of Europe . While , however , rejecting this proposition and insisting on the right of free transit into and from the Baltic , I have expressed to Denmark a willingness on the part of the United States to share liberally with other powers in compensating her for any advantages which commerce shall hereafter derive from expenditures made by her for the improvement and safety of the navigation of the Sound or Belts . I lay before you herewith sundry documents on the subject , in which my views are more fully disclosed . Should no satisfactory arrangement be soon concluded , I shall again call your attention to the subject , with recommendation of such measures as may appear to be required in order to assert and secure the rights of the United States , so far as they are affected by the pretensions of Denmark . I announce with much gratification that since the adjournment of the last Congress the question then existing between this Government and that of France respecting the French consul at San Francisco has been satisfactorily determined , and that the relations of the two Governments continue to be of the most friendly nature . A question , also , which has been pending for several years between the United States and the Kingdom of Greece , growing out of the sequestration by public authorities of that country of property belonging to the present American consul at Athens , and which had been the subject of very earnest discussion heretofore , has recently been settled to the satisfaction of the party interested and of both Governments . With Spain peaceful relations are still maintained , and some progress has been made in securing the redress of wrongs complained of by this Government . Spain has not only disavowed and disapproved the conduct of the officers who illegally seized and detained the steamer Black Warrior at Havana , but has also paid the sum claimed as indemnity for the loss thereby inflicted on citizens of the United States . In consequence of a destructive hurricane which visited Cuba in 1844 , the supreme authority of that island issued a decree permitting the importation for the period of six months of certain building materials and provisions free of duty , but revoked it when about half the period only had elapsed , to the injury of citizens of the United States who had proceeded to act on the faith of that decree . The Spanish Government refused indemnification to the parties aggrieved until recently , when it was assented to , payment being promised to be made so soon as the amount due can be ascertained . Satisfaction claimed for the arrest and search of the steamer El Dorado has not yet been accorded , but there is reason to believe that it will be and that case , with others , continues to be urged on the attention of the Spanish Government . I do not abandon the hope of concluding with Spain some general arrangement which , if it do not wholly prevent the recurrence of difficulties in Cuba , will render them less frequent , and , whenever they shall occur , facilitate their more speedy settlement . The interposition of this Government has been invoked by many of its citizens on account of injuries done to their persons and property for which the Mexican Republic is responsible . The unhappy situation of that country for some time past has not allowed its Government to give due consideration to claims of private reparation , and has appeared to call for and justify some forbearance in such matters on the part of this Government . But if the revolutionary movements which have lately occurred in that Republic end in the organization of a stable government , urgent appeals to its justice will then be made , and , it may be hoped , with success , for the redress of all complaints of our citizens . In regard to the American Republics , which from their proximity and other considerations have peculiar relations to this Government , while it has been my constant aim strictly to observe all the obligations of political friendship and of good neighborhood , obstacles to this have arisen in some of them from their own insufficient power to cheek lawless irruptions , which in effect throws most of the task on the United States . Thus it is that the distracted internal condition of the State of Nicaragua has made it incumbent on me to appeal to the good faith of our citizens to abstain from unlawful intervention in its affairs and to adopt preventive measures to the same end , which on a similar occasion had the best results in reassuring the peace of the Mexican States of Sonora and Lower California . Since the last session of Congress a treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation and for the surrender of fugitive criminals with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies a treaty of friendship , commerce , and navigation with Nicaragua , and a convention of commercial reciprocity with the Hawaiian Kingdom have been negotiated . The latter Kingdom and the State of Nicaragua have also acceded to a declaration recognizing as international rights the principles contained in the convention between the United States and Russia of July 22 , 1854 . These treaties and conventions will be laid before the Senate for ratification . The statements made in my last annual message respecting the anticipated receipts and expenditures of the Treasury have been substantially verified . It appears from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that the receipts during the last fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1855 , from all sources were 65 , 003 , 930 , and that the public expenditures for the same period , exclusive of payments on account of the public debt , amounted to 56 , 365 , 393 . During the same period the payments made in redemption of the public debt , including interest and premium , amounted to 9 , 844 , 528 . The balance in the Treasury at the beginning of the present fiscal year , July 1 , 1855 . , was 18 , 931 , 976 the receipts for the first quarter and the estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters amount together to 67 , 918 , 734 thus affording in all , as the available resources of the current fiscal year , the sum of 86 , 856 , 710 . If to the actual expenditures of the first quarter of the current fiscal year be added the probable expenditures for the remaining three quarters , as estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury , the sum total will be 71 , 226 , 846 , thereby leaving an estimated balance in the Treasury on July 1 , 1856 , of 15 , 623 , 863 . 41 . In the above estimated expenditures of the present fiscal year are included 3 , 000 , 000 to meet the last installment of the ten millions provided for in the late treaty with Mexico and 7 , 750 , 000 appropriated on account of the debt due to Texas , which two sums make an aggregate amount of 10 , 750 , 000 and reduce the expenditures , actual or estimated , for ordinary objects of the year to the sum of 60 , 476 , 000 . The amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present fiscal year was 40 , 583 , 631 , and , deduction being made of subsequent payments , the whole public debt of the Federal Government remaining at this time is less than 40 , 000 , 000 . The remnant of certain other Government stocks , amounting to 243 , 000 , referred to in my last message as outstanding , has since been paid . I am fully persuaded that it would be difficult to devise a system superior to that by which the fiscal business of the Government is now conducted . Notwithstanding the great number of public agents of collection and disbursement , it is believed that the checks and guards provided , including the requirement of monthly returns , render it scarcely possible for any considerable fraud on the part of those agents or neglect involving hazard of serious public loss to escape detection . I renew , however , the recommendation heretofore made by me of the enactment of a law declaring it felony on the part of public officers to insert false entries in their books of record or account or to make false returns , and also requiring them on the termination of their service to deliver to their successors all books , records , and other objects of a public nature in their custody . Derived , as our public revenue is , in chief part from duties on imports , its magnitude affords gratifying evidence of the prosperity , not only of our commerce , but of the other great interests upon which that depends . The principle that all moneys not required for the current expenses of the Government should remain for active employment in the hands of the people and the conspicuous fact that the annual revenue from all sources exceeds by many millions of dollars the amount needed for a prudent and economical administration of public affairs can not fail to suggest the propriety of an early revision and reduction of the tariff of duties on imports . It is now so generally conceded that the purpose of revenue alone can justify the imposition of duties on imports that in readjusting the impost tables and schedules , which unquestionably require essential modifications , a departure from the principles of the present tariff is not anticipated . The Army during the past year has been actively engaged in defending the Indian frontier , the state of the service permitting but few and small garrisons in our permanent fortifications . The additional regiments authorized at the last session of Congress have been recruited and organized , and a large portion of the troops have already been sent to the field . All the duties which devolve on the military establishment have been satisfactorily performed , and the dangers and privations incident to the character of the service required of our troops have furnished additional evidence of their courage , zeal , and capacity to meet any requisition which their country may make upon them . For the details of the military operations , the distribution of the troops , and additional provisions required for the military service , I refer to the report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents . Experience gathered from events which have transpired since my last annual message has but served to confirm the opinion then expressed of the propriety of making provision by a retired list for disabled officers and for increased compensation to the officers retained on the list for active duty . All the reasons which existed when these measures were recommended on former occasions continue without modification , except so far as circumstances have given to some of them additional force . The recommendations heretofore made for a partial reorganization of the Army are also renewed . The thorough elementary education given to those officers who commenced their service with the grade of cadet qualifies them to a considerable extent to perform the duties of every arm of the service but to give the highest efficiency to artillery requires the practice and special study of many years , and it is not , therefore , believed to be advisable to maintain in time of peace a larger force of that arm than can be usually employed in the duties appertaining to the service of field and siege artillery . The duties of the staff in all its various branches belong to the movements of troops , and the efficiency of an army in the field would materially depend upon the ability with which those duties are discharged . It is not , as in the case of the artillery , a specialty , but requires also an intimate knowledge of the duties of an officer of the line , and it is not doubted that to complete the education of an officer for either the line or the general staff it is desirable that he shall have served in both . With this view , it was recommended on a former occasion that the duties of the staff should be mainly performed by details from the line , and , with conviction of the advantages which would result from such a change , it is again presented for the consideration of Congress . The report of the Secretary of the Navy , herewith submitted , exhibits in full the naval operations of the past year , together with the present condition of the service , and it makes suggestions of further legislation , to which your attention is invited . The construction of the six steam frigates for which appropriations were made by the last Congress has proceeded in the most satisfactory manner and with such expedition as to warrant the belief that they will be ready for service early in the coming spring . Important as this addition to our naval force is , it still remains inadequate to the contingent exigencies of the protection of the extensive seacoast and vast commercial interests of the United States . In view of this fact and of the acknowledged wisdom of the policy of a gradual and systematic increase of the Navy an appropriation is recommended for the construction of six steam sloops of war . In regard to the steps taken in execution of the act of Congress to promote the efficiency of the Navy , it is unnecessary for me to say more than to express entire concurrence in the observations on that subject presented by the Secretary in his report . It will be perceived by the report of the postmaster General that the gross expenditure of the Department for the last fiiscal year was 9 , 968 , 342 and the gross receipts 7 , 342 , 136 , making an excess of expenditure over receipts of 2 , 626 , 206 and that the cost of mail transportation during that year was 674 , 952 greater than the previous year . Much of the heavy expenditures to which the Treasury is thus subjected is to be ascribed to the large quantity of printed matter conveyed by the mails , either franked or liable to no postage by law or to very low rates of postage compared with that charged on letters , and to the great cost of mail service on railroads and by ocean steamers . The suggestions of the Postmaster General on the subject deserve the consideration of Congress . The report of the Secretary of the Interior will engage your attention as well for useful suggestions it contains as for the interest and importance of the subjects to which they refer . The aggregate amount of public land sold during the last fiscal year , located with military scrip or land warrants , taken up under grants for roads , and selected as swamp lands by States is 24 , 557 , 409 acres , of which the portion sold was 15 , 729 , 524 acres , yielding in receipts the sum of 11 , 485 , 380 . In the same period of time 8 , 723 , 854 acres have been surveyed , but , in consideration of the quantity already subject to entry , no additional tracts have been brought into market . The peculiar relation of the General Government to the District of Columbia renders it proper to commend to your care not only its material but also its moral interests , including education , more especially in those parts of the District outside of the cities of Washington and Georgetown . The commissioners appointed to revise and codify the laws of the District have made such progress in the performance of their task as to insure its completion in the time prescribed by the act of Congress . Information has recently been received that the peace of the settlements in the Territories of Oregon and Washington is disturbed by hostilities on the part of the Indians , with indications of extensive combinations of a hostile character among the tribes in that quarter , the more serious in their possible effect by reason of the undetermined foreign interests existing in those Territories , to which your attention has already been especially invited . Efficient measures have been taken , which , it is believed , will restore quiet and afford protection to our citizens . In the Territory of Kansas there have been acts prejudicial to good order , but as yet none have occurred under circumstances to justify the interposition of the Federal Executive . That could only be in case of obstruction to Federal law or of organized resistance to Territorial law , assuming the character of insurrection , which , if it should occur , it would be my duty promptly to overcome and suppress . I cherish the hope , however , that the occurrence of any such untoward event will be prevented by the sound sense of the people of the Territory , who by its organic law , possessing the right to determine their own domestic institutions , are entitled while deporting themselves peacefully to the free exercise of that right , and must be protected in the enjoyment of it without interference on the part of the citizens of any of the States . The southern boundary line of this Territory has never been surveyed and established . The rapidly extending settlements in that region and the fact that the main route between Independence , in the State of Missouri , and New Mexico is contiguous in this line suggest the probability that embarrassing questions of jurisdiction may consequently arise . For these and other considerations I commend the subject to your early attention . I have thus passed in review the general state of the Union , including such particular concerns of the Federal Government , whether of domestic or foreign relation , as it appeared to me desirable and useful to bring to the special notice of Congress . Unlike the great States of Europe and Asia and many of those of America , these United States are wasting their strength neither in foreign war nor domestic strife . Whatever of discontent or public dissatisfaction exists is attributable to the imperfections of human nature or is incident to all governments , however perfect , which human wisdom can devise . Such subjects of political agitation as occupy the public mind consist to a great extent of exaggeration of inevitable evils , or over zeal in social improvement , or mere imagination of grievance , having but remote connection with any of the constitutional functions or duties of the Federal Government . To whatever extent these questions exhibit a tendency menacing to the stability of the Constitution or the integrity of the Union , and no further , they demand the consideration of the Executive and require to be presented by him to Congress . Before the thirteen colonies became a confederation of independent States they were associated only by community of transatlantic origin , by geographical position , and by the mutual tie of common dependence on Great Britain . When that tie was sundered they severally assumed the powers and rights of absolute self government . The municipal and social institutions of each , its laws of property and of personal relation , even its political organization , were such only as each one chose to establish , wholly without interference from any other . In the language of the Declaration of Independence , each State had full power to levy war , conclude peace , contract alliances , establish commerce , and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do . The several colonies differed in climate , in soil , in natural productions , in religion , in systems of education , in legislation , and in the forms of political administration , and they continued to differ in these respects when they voluntarily allied themselves as States to carry on the War of the Revolution . The object of that war was to disenthrall the united colonies from foreign rule , which had proved to be oppressive , and to separate them permanently from the mother country . The political result was the foundation of a Federal Republic of the free white men of the colonies , constituted , as they were , in distinct and reciprocally independent State governments . As for the subject races , whether Indian or African , the wise and brave statesmen of that day , being engaged in no extravagant scheme of social change , left them as they were , and thus preserved themselves and their posterity from the anarchy and the ever recurring civil wars which have prevailed in other revolutionized European colonies of America . When the confederated States found it convenient to modify the conditions of their association by giving to the General Government direct access in some respects to the people of the States , instead of confining it to action on the States as such , they proceeded to frame the existing Constitution , adhering steadily to one guiding thought , which was to delegate only such power as was necessary and proper to the execution of specific purposes , or , in other words , to retain as much as possible consistently with those purposes of the independent powers of the individual States . For objects of common defense and security , they intrusted to the General Government certain carefully defined functions , leaving all others as the undelegated rights of the separate independent sovereignties . Such is the constitutional theory of our Government , the practical observance of which has carried us , and us alone among modern republics , through nearly three generations of time without the cost of one drop of blood shed in civil war . With freedom and concert of action , it has enabled us to contend successfully on the battlefield against foreign foes , has elevated the feeble colonies into powerful States , and has raised our industrial productions and our commerce which transports them to the level of the richest and the greatest nations of Europe . And the admirable adaptation of our political institutions to their objects , combining local self government with aggregate strength , has established the practicability of a government like ours to cover a continent with confederate states . The Congress of the United States is in effect that congress of sovereignties which good men in the Old World have sought for , but could never attain , and which imparts to America an exemption from the mutable leagues for common action , from the wars , the mutual invasions , and vague aspirations after the balance of power which convulse from time to time the Governments of Europe . Our cooperative action rests in the conditions of permanent confederation prescribed by the Constitution . Our balance of power is in the separate reserved rights of the States and their equal representation in the Senate . That independent sovereignty in every one of the States , with its reserved rights of local self government assured to each by their coequal power in the Senate , was the fundamental condition of the Constitution . Without it the Union would never have existed . However desirous the larger States might be to reorganize the Government so as to give to their population its proportionate weight in the common counsels , they knew it was impossible unless they conceded to the smaller ones authority to exercise at least a negative influence on all the measures of the Government , whether legislative or executive , through their equal representation in the Senate . Indeed , the larger States themselves could not have failed to perceive that the same power was equally necessary to them for the security of their own domestic interests against the aggregate force of the General Government . In a word , the original States went into this permanent league on the agreed premises of exerting their common strength for the defense of the whole and of all its parts , but of utterly excluding all capability of reciprocal aggression . Each solemnly bound itself to all the others neither to undertake nor permit any encroachment upon or intermeddling with another s reserved rights . Where it was deemed expedient particular rights of the States were expressly guaranteed by the Constitution , but in all things besides these rights were guarded by the limitation of the powers granted and by express reservation of all powers not granted in the compact of union . Thus the great power of taxation was limited to purposes of common defense and general welfare , excluding objects appertaining to the local legislation of the several States and those purposes of general welfare and common defense were afterwards defined by specific enumeration as being matters only of co relation between the States themselves or between them and foreign governments , which , because of their common and general nature , could not be left to the separate control of each State . Of the circumstances of local condition , interest , and rights in which a portion of the States , constituting one great section of the Union , differed from the rest and from another section , the most important was the peculiarity of a larger relative colored population in the Southern than in the Northern States . A population of this class , held in subjection , existed in nearly all the States , but was more numerous and of more serious concernment in the South than in the North on account of natural differences of climate and production and it was foreseen that , for the same reasons , while this population would diminish and sooner or later cease to exist in some States , it might increase in others . The peculiar character and magnitude of this question of local rights , not in material relations only , but still more in social ones , caused it to enter into the special stipulations of the Constitution . Hence , while the General Government , as well by the enumerated powers granted to it as by those not enumerated , and therefore refused to it , was forbidden to touch this matter in the sense of attack or offense , it was placed under the general safeguard of the Union in the sense of defense against either invasion or domestic violence , like all other local interests of the several States . Each State expressly stipulated , as well for itself as for each and all of its citizens , and every citizen of each State became solemnly bound by his allegiance to the Constitution that any person held to service or labor in one State , escaping into another , should not , in consequence of any law or regulation thereof , be discharged from such service or labor , but should be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor might be due by the laws of his State . Thus and thus only , by the reciprocal guaranty of all the rights of every State against interference on the part of another , was the present form of government established by our fathers and transmitted to us , and by no other means is it possible for it to exist . If one State ceases to respect the rights of another and obtrusively intermeddles with its local interests if a portion of the States assume to impose their institutions on the others or refuse to fulfill their obligations to them , we are no longer united , friendly States , but distracted , hostile ones , with little capacity left of common advantage , but abundant means of reciprocal injury and mischief . Practically it is immaterial whether aggressive interference between the States or deliberate refusal on the part of any one of them to comply with constitutional obligations arise from erroneous conviction or blind prejudice , whether it be perpetrated by direction or indirection . In either case it is full of threat and of danger to the durability of the Union . Placed in the office of Chief Magistrate as the executive agent of the whole country , bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and specially enjoined by the Constitution to give information to Congress on the state of the Union , it would be palpable neglect of duty on my part to pass over a subject like this , which beyond all things at the present time vitally concerns individual and public security . It has been matter of painful regret to see States conspicuous for their services in rounding this Republic and equally sharing its advantages disregard their constitutional obligations to it . Although conscious of their inability to heal admitted and palpable social evils of their own , and which are completely within their jurisdiction , they engage in the offensive and hopeless undertaking of reforming the domestic institutions of other States , wholly beyond their control and authority . In the vain pursuit of ends by them entirely unattainable , and which they may not legally attempt to compass , they peril the very existence of the Constitution and all the countless benefits which it has conferred . While the people of the Southern States confine their attention to their own affairs , not presuming officiously to intermeddle with the social institutions of the Northern States , too many of the inhabitants of the latter are permanently organized in associations to inflict injury on the former by wrongful acts , which would be cause of war as between foreign powers and only fail to be such in our system because perpetrated under cover of the Union . Is it possible to present this subject as truth and the occasion require without noticing the reiterated but groundless allegation that the South has persistently asserted claims and obtained advantages in the practical administration of the General Government to the prejudice of the North , and in which the latter has acquiesced That is , the States which either promote or tolerate attacks on the rights of persons and of property in other States , to disguise their own injustice , pretend or imagine , and constantly aver , that they , whose constitutional rights are thus systematically assailed , are themselves the aggressors . At the present time this imputed aggression , resting , as it does , only in the vague declamatory charges of political agitators , resolves itself into misapprehension , or misinterpretation , of the principles and facts of the political organization of the new Territories of the United States . What is the voice of history When the ordinance which provided for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio and for its eventual subdivision into new States was adopted in the Congress of the Confederation , it is not to be supposed that the question of future relative power as between the States which retained and those which did not retain a numerous colored population escaped notice or failed to be considered . And yet the concession of that vast territory to the interests and opinions of the Northern States , a territory now the seat of five among the largest members of the Union , was in great measure the act of the State of Virginia and of the South . When Louisiana was acquired by the United States , it was an acquisition not less to the North than to the South for while it was important to the country at the mouth of the river Mississippi to become the emporium of the country above it , so also it was even more important to the whole Union to have that emporium and although the new province , by reason of its imperfect settlement , was mainly regarded as on the Gulf of Mexico , yet in fact it extended to the opposite boundaries of the United States , with far greater breadth above than below , and was in territory , as in everything else , equally at least an accession to the Northern States . It is mere delusion and prejudice , therefore , to speak of Louisiana as acquisition in the special interest of the South . The patriotic and just men who participated in the act were influenced by motives far above all sectional jealousies . It was in truth the great event which , by completing for us the possession of the Valley of the Mississippi , with commercial access to the Gulf of Mexico , imparted unity and strength to the whole Confederation and attached together by indissoluble ties the East and the West , as well as the North and the South . As to Florida , that was but the transfer by Spain to the United States of territory on the east side of the river Mississippi in exchange for large territory which the United States transferred to Spain on the west side of that river , as the entire diplomatic history of the transaction serves to demonstrate . Moreover , it was an acquisition demanded by the commercial interests and the security of the whole Union . In the meantime the people of the United States had grown up to a proper consciousness of their strength , and in a brief contest with France and in a second serious war with Great Britain they had shaken off all which remained of undue reverence for Europe , and emerged from the atmosphere of those transatlantic influences which surrounded the infant Republic , and had begun to turn their attention to the full and systematic development of the internal resources of the Union . Among the evanescent controversies of that period the most conspicuous was the question of regulation by Congress of the social condition of the future States to be rounded in the territory of Louisiana . The ordinance for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio had contained a provision which prohibited the use of servile labor therein , subject to the condition of the extraditions of fugitives from service due in any other part of the United States . Subsequently to the adoption of the Constitution this provision ceased to remain as a law , for its operation as such was absolutely superseded by the Constitution . But the recollection of the fact excited the zeal of social propagandism in some sections of the Confederation , and when a second State , that of Missouri , came to be formed in the territory of Louisiana proposition was made to extend to the latter territory the restriction originally applied to the country situated between the rivers Ohio and Mississippi . Most questionable as was this proposition in all its constitutional relations , nevertheless it received the sanction of Congress , with some slight modifications of line , to save the existing rights of the intended new State . It was reluctantly acquiesced in by Southern States as a sacrifice to the cause of peace and of the Union , not only of the rights stipulated by the treaty of Louisiana , but of the principle of equality among the States guaranteed by the Constitution . It was received by the Northern States with angry and resentful condemnation and complaint , because it did not concede all which they had exactingly demanded . Having passed through the forms of legislation , it took its place in the statute book , standing open to repeal , like any other act of doubtful constitutionality , subject to be pronounced null and void by the courts of law , and possessing no possible efficacy to control the rights of the States which might thereafter be organized out of any part of the original territory of Louisiana . In all this , if any aggression there were , any innovation upon preexisting rights , to which portion of the Union are they justly chargeable This controversy passed away with the occasion , nothing surviving it save the dormant letter of the statute . But long afterwards , when by the proposed accession of the Republic of Texas the United States were to take their next step in territorial greatness , a similar contingency occurred and became the occasion for systematized attempts to intervene in the domestic affairs of one section of the Union , in defiance of their rights as States and of the stipulations of the Constitution . These attempts assumed a practical direction in the shape of persevering endeavors by some of the Representatives in both Houses of Congress to deprive the Southern States of the supposed benefit of the provisions of the act authorizing the organization of the State of Missouri . But the good sense of the people and the vital force of the Constitution triumphed over sectional prejudice and the political errors of the day , and the State of Texas returned to the Union as she was , with social institutions which her people had chosen for themselves and with express agreement by the reannexing act that she should be susceptible of subdivision into a plurality of States . Whatever advantage the interests of the Southern States , as such , gained by this were far inferior in results , as they unfolded in the progress of time , to those which sprang from previous concessions made by the South . To every thoughtful friend of the Union , to the true lovers of their country , to all who longed and labored for the full success of this great experiment of republican institutions , it was cause of gratulation that such an opportunity had occurred to illustrate our advancing power on this continent and to furnish to the world additional assurance of the strength and stability of the Constitution . Who would wish to see Florida still a European colony Who would rejoice to hail Texas as a lone star instead of one in the galaxy of States Who does not appreciate the incalculable benefits of the acquisition of Louisiana And yet narrow views and sectional purposes would inevitably have excluded them all from the Union . But another struggle on the same point ensued when our victorious armies returned from Mexico and it devolved on Congress to provide for the territories acquired by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . The great relations of the subject had now become distinct and clear to the perception of the public mind , which appreciated the evils of sectional controversy upon the question of the admission of new States . In that crisis intense solicitude pervaded the nation . But the patriotic impulses of the popular heart , guided by the admonitory advice of the Father of his Country , rose superior to all the difficulties of the incorporation of a new empire into the Union . In the counsels of Congress there was manifested extreme antagonism of opinion and action between some Representatives , who sought by the abusive and unconstitutional employment of the legislative powers of the Government to interfere in the condition of the inchoate States and to impose their own social theories upon the latter , and other Representatives , who repelled the interposition of the General Government in this respect and maintained the self constituting rights of the States . In truth , the thing attempted was in form alone action of the General Government , while in reality it was the endeavor , by abuse of legislative power , to force the ideas of internal policy entertained in particular States upon allied independent States . Once more the Constitution and the Union triumphed signally . The new territories were organized without restrictions on the disputed point , and were thus left to judge in that particular for themselves and the sense of constitutional faith proved vigorous enough in Congress not only to accomplish this primary object , but also the incidental and hardly less important one of so amending the provisions of the statute for the extradition of fugitives from service as to place that public duty under the safeguard of the General Government , and thus relieve it from obstacles raised up by the legislation of some of the States . Vain declamation regarding the provisions of law for the extradition of fugitives from service , with occasional episodes of frantic effort to obstruct their execution by riot and murder , continued for a brief time to agitate certain localities . But the true principle of leaving each State and Territory to regulate its own laws of labor according to its own sense of right and expediency had acquired fast hold of the public judgment , to such a degree that by common consent it was observed in the organization of the Territory of Washington . When , more recently , it became requisite to organize the Territories of Nebraska and Kansas , it was the natural and legitimate , if not the inevitable , consequence of previous events and legislation that the same great and sound principle which had already been applied to Utah and New Mexico should be applied to them that they should stand exempt from the restrictions proposed in the act relative to the State of Missouri . These restrictions were , in the estimation of many thoughtful men , null from the beginning , unauthorized by the Constitution , contrary to the treaty stipulations for the cession of Louisiana , and inconsistent with the equality of these States . They had been stripped of all moral authority by persistent efforts to procure their indirect repeal through contradictory enactments . They had been practically abrogated by the legislation attending the organization of Utah , New Mexico , and Washington . If any vitality remained in them it would have been taken away , in effect , by the new Territorial acts in the form originally proposed to the Senate at the first session of the last Congress . It was manly and ingenuous , as well as patriotic and just , to do this directly and plainly , and thus relieve the statute book of an act which might be of possible future injury , but of no possible future benefit and the measure of its repeal was the final consummation and complete recognition of the principle that no portion of the United States shall undertake through assumption of the powers of the General Government to dictate the social institutions of any other portion . The scope and effect of the language of repeal were not left in doubt . It was declared in terms to be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State , nor to exclude it therefrom , but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way , subject only to the Constitution of the United States . The measure could not be withstood upon its merits alone . It was attacked with violence on the false or delusive pretext that it constituted a breach of faith . Never was objection more utterly destitute of substantial justification . When before was it imagined by sensible men that a regulative or declarative statute , whether enacted ten or forty years ago , is irrepealable that an act of Congress is above the Constitution If , indeed , there were in the facts any cause to impute bad faith , it would attach to those only who have never ceased , from the time of the enactment of the restrictive provision to the present day , to denounce and condemn it who have constantly refused to complete it by needful supplementary legislation who have spared no exertion to deprive it of moral force who have themselves again and again attempted its repeal by the enactment of incompatible provisions , and who , by the inevitable reactionary effect of their own violence on the subject , awakened the country to perception of the true constitutional principle of leaving the matter involved to the discretion of the people of the respective existing or incipient States . It is not pretended that this principle or any other precludes the possibility of evils in practice , disturbed , as political action is liable to be , by human passions . No form of government is exempt from inconveniences but in this case they are the result of the abuse , and not of the legitimate exercise , of the powers reserved or conferred in the organization of a Territory . They are not to be charged to the great principle of popular sovereignty . On the contrary , they disappear before the intelligence and patriotism of the people , exerting through the ballot box their peaceful and silent but irresistible power . If the friends of the Constitution are to have another struggle , its enemies could not present a more acceptable issue than that of a State whose constitution clearly embraces a republican form of government being excluded from the Union because its domestic institutions may not in all respects comport with the ideas of what is wise and expedient entertained in some other State . Fresh from groundless imputations of breach of faith against others , men will commence the agitation of this new question with indubitable violation of an express compact between the independent sovereign powers of the United States and of the Republic of Texas , as well as of the older and equally solemn compacts which assure the equality of all the States . But deplorable as would be such a violation of compact in itself and in all its direct consequences , that is the very least of the evils involved . When sectional agitators shall have succeeded in forcing on this issue , can their pretensions fail to be met by counter pretensions Will not different States be compelled , respectively , to meet extremes with extremes And if either extreme carry its point , what is that so far forth but dissolution of the Union If a new State , formed from the territory of the United States , be absolutely excluded from admission therein , that fact of itself constitutes the disruption of union between it and the other States . But the process of dissolution could not stop there . Would not a sectional decision producing such result by a majority of votes , either Northern or Southern , of necessity drive out the oppressed and aggrieved minority and place in presence of each other two irreconcilably hostile confederations It is necessary to speak thus plainly of projects the offspring of that sectional agitation now prevailing in some of the States , which are as impracticable as they are unconstitutional , and which if persevered in must and will end calamitously . It is either disunion and civil war or it is mere angry , idle , aimless disturbance of public peace and tranquillity . Disunion for what If the passionate rage of fanaticism and partisan spirit did not force the fact upon our attention , it would be difficult to believe that any considerable portion of the people of this enlightened country could have so surrendered themselves to a fanatical devotion to the supposed interests of the relatively few Africans in the United States as totally to abandon and disregard the interests of the 25 , 000 , 000 Americans to trample under foot the injunctions of moral and constitutional obligation , and to engage in plans of vindictive hostility against those who are associated with them in the enjoyment of the common heritage of our national institutions . Nor is it hostility against their fellow citizens of one section of the Union alone . The interests , the honor , the duty , the peace , and the prosperity of the people of all sections are equally involved and imperiled in this question . And are patriotic men in any part of the Union prepared on such issue thus madly to invite all the consequences of the forfeiture of their constitutional engagements It is impossible . The storm of frenzy and faction must inevitably dash itself in vain against the unshaken rock of the Constitution . I shall never doubt it . I know that the Union is stronger a thousand times than all the wild and chimerical schemes of social change which are generated one after another in the unstable minds of visionary sophists and interested agitators . I rely confidently on the patriotism of the people , on the dignity and self respect of the States , on the wisdom of Congress , and , above all , on the continued gracious favor of Almighty God to maintain against all enemies , whether at home or abroad , the sanctity of the Constitution and the integrity of the Union .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives I transmit herewith reports of the Secretary of State , the Secretary of the Navy , and the Attorney General , in reply to a resolution of the Senate of the 24th of March last , and also to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th of May instant , both having reference to the routes of transit between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Republics of New Granada and Nicaragua and to the condition of affairs in Central America . These documents relate to questions of the highest importance and interest to the people of the United States . The narrow isthmus which connects the continents of North and South America , by the facilities it affords for easy transit between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , rendered the countries of Central America an object of special consideration to all maritime nations , which has been greatly augmented in modern times by the operation of changes in commercial relations , especially those produced by the general use of steam as a motive power by land and sea . To us , on account of its geographical position and of our political interest as an American State of primary magnitude , that isthmus is of peculiar importance , just as the Isthmus of Suez is , for corresponding reasons , to the maritime powers of Europe . But above all , the importance to the United States of securing free transit across the American isthmus has rendered it of paramount interest to us since the settlement of the Territories of Oregon and Washington and the accession of California to the Union . Impelled by these considerations , the United States took steps at an early day to assure suitable means of commercial transit by canal railway , or otherwise across this isthmus . We concluded , in the first place , a treaty of peace , amity , navigation , and commerce with the Republic of New Granada , among the conditions of which was a stipulation on the part of New Granada guaranteeing to the United States the right of way or transit across that part of the Isthmus which lies in the territory of New Granada , in consideration of which the United States guaranteed in respect of the same territory the rights of sovereignty and property of New Granada . The effect of this treaty was to afford to the people of the United States facilities for at once opening a common road from Chagres to Panama and for at length constructing a railway in the same direction , to connect regularly with steamships , for the transportation of mails , specie , and passengers to and fro between the Atlantic and Pacific States and Territories of the United States . The United States also endeavored , but unsuccessfully , to obtain from the Mexican Republic the cession of the right of way at the northern extremity of the Isthmus by Tehuantepec , and that line of communication continues to be an object of solicitude to the people of this Republic . In the meantime , intervening between the Republic of New Granada and the Mexican Republic lie the States of Guatemala , Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua , and Costa Rica , the several members of the former Republic of Central America . Here , in the territory of the Central American States , is the narrowest part of the Isthmus , and hither , of course , public attention has been directed as the most inviting field for enterprises of interoceanic communication between the opposite shores of America , and more especially to the territory of the States of Nicaragua and Honduras . Paramount to that of any European State , as was the interest of the United States in the security and freedom of projected lines of travel across the Isthmus by the way of Nicaragua and Honduras , still we did not yield in this respect to any suggestions of territorial aggrandizement , or even of exclusive advantage , either of communication or of commerce . Opportunities had not been wanting to the United States to procure such advantage by peaceful means and with full and free assent of those who alone had any legitimate authority in the matter . We disregarded those opportunities from considerations alike of domestic and foreign policy , just as , even to the present day , we have persevered in a system of justice and respect for the rights and interests of others as well as our own in regard to each and all of the States of Central America . It was with surprise and regret , therefore , that the United States learned a few days after the conclusion of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , by which the United States became , with the consent of the Mexican Republic , the rightful owners of California , and thus invested with augmented special interest in the political condition of Central America , that a military expedition , under the authority of the British Government , had landed at San Juan del Norte , in the State of Nicaragua , and taken forcible possession of that port , the necessary terminus of any canal or railway across the Isthmus within the territories of Nicaragua . It did not diminish the unwelcomeness to us of this act on the part of Great Britain to find that she assumed to justify it on the ground of an alleged protectorship of a small and obscure band of uncivilized Indians , whose proper name had even become lost to history , who did not constitute a state capable of territorial sovereignty either in fact or of right , and all political interest in whom and in the territory they occupied Great Britain had previously renounced by successive treaties with Spain when Spain was sovereign to the country and subsequently with independent Spanish America . Nevertheless , and injuriously affected as the United States conceived themselves to have been by this act of the British Government and by its occupation about the same time of insular and of continental portions of the territory of the State of Honduras , we remembered the many and powerful ties and mutual interests by which Great Britain and the United States are associated , and we proceeded in earnest good faith and with a sincere desire to do whatever might strengthen the bonds of peace between us to negotiate with Great Britain a convention to assure the perfect neutrality of all interoceanic communications across the Isthmus and , as the indispensable condition of such neutrality , the absolute independence of the States of Central America and their complete sovereignty within the limits of their own territory as well against Great Britain as against the United States . We supposed we had accomplished that object by the convention of April 19 , 1850 , which would never have been signed nor ratified on the part of the United States but for the conviction that in virtue of its provisions neither Great Britain nor the United States was thereafter to exercise any territorial sovereignty in fact or in name in any part of Central America , however or whensoever acquired , either before or afterwards . The essential object of the convention the neutralization of the Isthmus would , of course , become a nullity if either Great Britain or the United States were to continue to hold exclusively islands or mainland of the Isthmus , and more especially if , under any claim of protectorship of Indians , either Government were to remain forever sovereign in fact of the Atlantic shores of the three States of Costa Rica , Nicaragua , and Honduras . I have already communicated to the two Houses of Congress full information of the protracted and hitherto fruitless efforts which the United States have made to arrange this international question with Great Britain . It is referred to on the present occasion only because of its intimate connection with the special object now to be brought to the attention of Congress . The unsettled political condition of some of the Spanish American Republics has never ceased to be regarded by this Government with solicitude and regret on their own account , while it has been the source of continual embarrassment in our public and private relations with them . In the midst of the violent revolutions and the wars by which they are continually agitated , their public authorities are unable to afford due protection to foreigners and to foreign interests within their territory , or even to defend their own soil against individual aggressors , foreign or domestic , the burden of the inconveniences and losses of which therefore devolves in no inconsiderable degree upon the foreign states associated with them in close relations of geographical vicinity or of commercial intercourse . Such is more emphatically the situation of the United States with respect to the Republics of Mexico and of Central America . Notwithstanding , however , the relative remoteness of the European States from America , facts of the same order have not failed to appear conspicuously in their intercourse with Spanish American Republics . Great Britain has repeatedly been constrained to recur to measures of force for the protection of British interests in those countries . France found it necessary to attack the castle of San Juan de Uloa and even to debark troops at Vera Cruz in order to obtain redress of wrongs done to Frenchmen in Mexico . What is memorable in this respect in the conduct and policy of the United States is that while it would be as easy for us to annex and absorb new territories in America as it is for European States to do this in Asia or Africa , and while if done by us it might be justified as well on the alleged ground of the advantage which would accrue therefrom to the territories annexed and absorbed , yet we have abstained from doing it , in obedience to considerations of right not less than of policy and that while the courageous and self reliant spirit of our people prompts them to hardy enterprises , and they occasionally yield to the temptation of taking part in the troubles of countries near at hand , where they know how potential their influence , moral and material , must be , the American Government has uniformly and steadily resisted all attempts of individuals in the United States to undertake armed aggression against friendly Spanish American Republics . While the present incumbent of the executive office has been in discharge of its duties he has never failed to exert all the authority in him vested to repress such enterprises , because they are in violation of the law of the land , which the Constitution requires him to execute faithfully because they are contrary to the policy of the Government , and because to permit them would be a departure from good faith toward those American Republics in amity with us , which are entitled to , and will never cease to enjoy , in their calamities the cordial sympathy , and in their prosperity the efficient good will , of the Government and of the people of the United States . To say that our laws in this respect are sometimes violated or successfully evaded is only to say what is true of all laws in all countries , but not more so in the United States than in any one whatever of the countries of Europe . Suffice it to repeat that the laws of the United States prohibiting all foreign military enlistments or expeditions within our territory have been executed with impartial good faith , and , so far as the nature of things permits , as well in repression of private persons as of the official agents of other Governments , both of Europe and America . Among the Central American Republics to which modern events have imparted most prominence is that of Nicaragua , by reason of its particular position on the Isthmus . Citizens of the United States have established in its territory a regular interoceanic transit route , second only in utility and value to the one previously established in the territory of New Granada . The condition of Nicaragua would , it is believed , have been much more prosperous than it has been but for the occupation of its only Atlantic port by a foreign power , and of the disturbing authority set up and sustained by the same power in a portion of its territory , by means of which its domestic sovereignty was impaired , its public lands were withheld from settlement , and it was deprived of all the maritime revenue which it would otherwise collect on imported merchandise at San Juan del Norte . In these circumstances of the political debility of the Republic of Nicaragua , and when its inhabitants were exhausted by long continued civil war between parties neither of them strong enough to overcome the other or permanently maintain internal tranquillity , one of the contending factions of the Republic invited the assistance and cooperation of a small body of citizens of the United States from the State of California , whose presence , as it appears , put an end at once to civil war and restored apparent order throughout the territory of Nicaragua , with a new administration , having at its head a distinguished individual , by birth a citizen of the Republic , Patricio Rivas , as its provisional President . It is the established policy of the United States to recognize all governments without question of their source or their organization , or of the means by which the governing persons attain their power , provided there be a government de facto accepted by the people of the country , and with reserve only of the time as to the recognition of revolutionary governments arising out of the subdivision of parent states with which we are in relations of amity . We do not go behind the fact of a foreign government exercising actual power to investigate questions of legitimacy we do not inquire into the causes which may have led to a change of government . To us it is indifferent whether a successful revolution has been aided by foreign intervention or not whether insurrection has overthrown existing government , and another has been established in its place according to preexisting forms or in a manner adopted for the occasion by those whom we may find in the actual possession of power . All these matters we leave to the people and public authorities of the particular country to determine and their determination , whether it be by positive action or by ascertained acquiescence , is to us a sufficient warranty of the legitimacy of the new government . During the sixty seven years which have elapsed since the establishment of the existing Government of the United States , in all which time this Union has maintained undisturbed domestic tranquillity , we have had occasion to recognize governments de facto , founded either by domestic revolution or by military invasion from abroad , in many of the Governments of Europe . It is the more imperatively necessary to apply this rule to the Spanish American Republics , in consideration of the frequent and not seldom anomalous changes of organization or administration which they undergo and the revolutionary nature of most of these changes , of which the recent series of revolutions in the Mexican Republic is an example , where five successive revolutionary governments have made their appearance in the course of a few months and been recognized successively , each as the political power of that country , by the United States . When , therefore , some time since , a new minister from the Republic of Nicaragua presented himself , bearing the commission of President Rivas , he must and would have been received as such , unless he was found on inquiry subject to personal exception , but for the absence of satisfactory information upon the question whether President Rivas was in fact the head of an established Government of the Republic of Nicaragua , doubt as to which arose not only from the circumstances of his avowed association with armed emigrants recently from the United States , but that the proposed minister himself was of that class of persons , and not otherwise or previously a citizen of Nicaragua . Another minister from the Republic of Nicaragua has now presented himself , and has been received as such , satisfactory evidence appearing that he represents the Government de facto and , so far as such exists , the Government de jure of that Republic . That reception , while in accordance with the established policy of the United States , was likewise called for by the most imperative special exigencies , which require that this Government shall enter at once into diplomatic relations with that of Nicaragua . In the first place , a difference has occurred between the Government of President Rivas and the Nicaragua Transit Company , which involves the necessity of inquiry into rights of citizens of the United States , who allege that they have been aggrieved by the acts of the former and claim protection and redress at the hands of their Government . In the second place , the interoceanic communication by the way of Nicaragua is effectually interrupted , and the persons and property of unoffending private citizens of the United States in that country require the attention of their Government . Neither of these objects can receive due consideration without resumption of diplomatic intercourse with the Government of Nicaragua . Further than this , the documents communicated show that while the interoceanic transit by the way of Nicaragua is cut off , disturbances at Panama have occurred to obstruct , temporarily at least , that by the way of New Granada , involving the sacrifice of the lives and property of citizens of the United States . A special commissioner has been dispatched to Panama to investigate the facts of this occurrence with a view particularly to the redress of parties aggrieved . But measures of another class will be demanded for the future security of interoceanic communication by this as by the other routes of the Isthmus . It would be difficult to suggest a single object of interest , external or internal , more important to the United States than the maintenance of the communication , by land and sea , between the Atlantic and Pacific States and Territories of the Union . It is a material element of the national integrity and sovereignty . I have adopted such precautionary measures and have taken such action for the purpose of affording security to the several transit routes of Central America and to the persons and property of citizens of the United States connected with or using the same as are within my constitutional power and as existing circumstances have seemed to demand . Should these measures prove inadequate to the object , that fact will be communicated to Congress with such recommendations as the exigency of the case may indicate .<speech_sep>
