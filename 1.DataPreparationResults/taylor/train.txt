To the Senate of the United States I transmit to the Senate , in answer to a resolution of that body passed on the 17th instant , the accompanying reports of heads of Departments which contain all the official information in the possession of the Executive asked for by the resolution . On coming into office I found the military commandant of the Department of California exercising the functions of civil governor in that Territory , and left , as I was , to act under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , without the aid of any legislative provision establishing a government in that Territory , I thought it best not to disturb that arrangement , made under my predecessor , until Congress should take some action on that subject . I therefore did not interfere with the powers of the military commandant , who continued to exercise the functions of civil governor as before but I made no such appointment , conferred no such authority , and have allowed no increased compensation to the commandant for his services . With a view to the faithful execution of the treaty so far as lay in the power of the Executive , and to enable Congress to act at the present session with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible on all matters of interest in these Territories , I sent the Thomas Butler King as bearer of dispatches to California , and certain officers to California and New Mexico , whose duties are particularly defined in the accompanying letters of instruction addressed to them severally by the proper Departments . I did not hesitate to express to the people of those Territories my desire that each Territory should , if prepared to comply with the requisitions of the Constitution of the United States , form a plan of a State constitution and submit the same to Congress with a prayer for admission into the Union as a State , but I did not anticipate , suggest , or authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent of Congress , nor did I authorize any Government agent or officer to interfere with or exercise any influence or control over the election of delegates or over any convention in making or modifying their domestic institutions or any of the provisions of their proposed constitution . On the contrary , the instructions given by my orders were that all measures of domestic policy adopted by the people of California must originate solely with themselves that while the Executive of the United States was desirous to protect them in the formation of any government republican in its character , to be at the proper time submitted to Congress , yet it was to be distinctly understood that the plan of such a government must at the same time be the result of their own deliberate choice and originate with themselves , without the interference of the Executive . I am unable to give any information as to laws passed by any supposed government in California or of any census taken in either of the Territories mentioned in the resolution , as I have no information on those subjects . As already stated , I have not disturbed the arrangements which I found had existed under my predecessor . In advising an early application by the people of these Territories for admission as States I was actuated principally by an earnest desire to afford to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress the opportunity of avoiding occasions of bitter and angry dissensions among the people of the United States . Under the Constitution every State has the right of establishing and from time to time altering its municipal laws and domestic institutions independently of every other State and of the General Government , subject only to the prohibitions and guaranties expressly set forth in the Constitution of the United States . The subjects thus left exclusively to the respective States were not designed or expected to become topics of national agitation . Still , as under the Constitution Congress has power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the Territories of the United States , every new acquisition of territory has led to discussions on the question whether the system of involuntary servitude which prevails in many of the States should or should not be prohibited in that territory . The periods of excitement from this cause which have heretofore occurred have been safely passed , but during the interval , of whatever length , which may elapse before the admission of the Territories ceded by Mexico as States it appears probable that similar excitement will prevail to an undue extent . Under these circumstances I thought , and still think , that it was my duty to endeavor to put it in the power of Congress , by the admission of California and New Mexico as States , to remove all occasion for the unnecessary agitation of the public mind . It is understood that the people of the western part of California have formed a plan of a State constitution and will soon submit the same to the judgment of Congress and apply for admission as a State . This course on their part , though in accordance with , was not adopted exclusively in consequence of , any expression of my wishes , inasmuch as measures tending to this end had been promoted by the officers sent there by my predecessor , and were already in active progress of execution before any communication from me reached California . If the proposed constitution shall , when submitted to Congress , be found to be in compliance with the requisitions of the Constitution of the United States , I earnestly recommend that it may receive the sanction of Congress . The part of California not included in the proposed State of that name is believed to be uninhabited , except in a settlement of our countrymen in the vicinity of Salt Lake . A claim has been advanced by the State of Texas to a very large portion of the most populous district of the Territory commonly designated by the name of New Mexico . If the people of New Mexico had formed a plan of a State government for that Territory as ceded by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , and had been admitted by Congress as a State , our Constitution would have afforded the means of obtaining an adjustment of the question of boundary with Texas by a judicial decision . At present , however , no judicial tribunal has the power of deciding that question , and it remains for Congress to devise some mode for its adjustment . Meanwhile I submit to Congress the question whether it would be expedient before such adjustment to establish a Territorial government , which by including the district so claimed would practically decide the question adversely to the State of Texas , or by excluding it would decide it in her favor . In my opinion such a course would not be expedient , especially as the people of this Territory still enjoy the benefit and protection of their municipal laws originally derived from Mexico and have a military force stationed there to protect them against the Indians . It is undoubtedly true that the property , lives , liberties , and religion of the people of New Mexico are better protected than they ever were before the treaty of cession . Should Congress , when California shall present herself for incorporation into the Union , annex a condition to her admission as a State affecting her domestic institutions contrary to the wishes of her people , and even compel her temporarily to comply with it , yet the State could change her constitution at any time after admission when to her it should seem expedient . Any attempt to deny to the people of the State the right of self government in a matter which peculiarly affects themselves will infallibly be regarded by them as an invasion of their rights , and , upon the principles laid down in our own Declaration of Independence , they will certainly be sustained by the great mass of the American people . To assert that they are a conquered people and must as a State submit to the will of their conquerors in this regard will meet with no cordial response among American freemen . Great numbers of them are native citizens of the United States , not inferior to the rest of our countrymen in intelligence and patriotism , and no language of menace to restrain them in the exercise of an undoubted right , substantially guaranteed to them by the treaty of cession itself , shall ever be uttered by me or encouraged and sustained by persons acting under my authority . It is to be expected that in the residue of the territory ceded to us by Mexico the people residing there will at the time of their incorporation into the Union as a State settle all questions of domestic policy to suit themselves . No material inconvenience will result from the want for a short period of a government established by Congress over that part of the territory which lies eastward of the new State of California and the reasons for my opinion that New Mexico will at no very distant period ask for admission into the Union are rounded on unofficial information which , I suppose , is common to all who have cared to make inquiries on that subject . Seeing , then , that the question which now excites such painful sensations in the country will in the end certainly be settled by the silent effect of causes independent of the action of Congress , I again submit to your wisdom the policy recommended in my annual message of awaiting the salutary operation of those causes , believing that we shall thus avoid the creation of geographical parties and secure the harmony of feeling so necessary to the beneficial action of our political system . Connected , as the Union is , with the remembrance of past happiness , the sense of present blessings , and the hope of future peace and prosperity , every dictate of wisdom , every feeling of duty , and every emotion of patriotism tend to inspire fidelity and devotion to it and admonish us cautiously to avoid any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger it or impair its strength , the chief element of which is to be found in the regard and affection of the people for each other .<speech_sep>Elected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws , I appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution , and , in compliance with a time honored custom , to address those who are now assembled . The confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be the Chief Magistrate of a Republic holding a high rank among the nations of the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude but when I reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous duties and involves the weightiest obligations , I am conscious that the position which I have been called to fill , though sufficient to satisfy the loftiest ambition , is surrounded by fearful responsibilities . Happily , however , in the performance of my new duties I shall not be without able cooperation . The legislative and judicial branches of the Government present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments and matured experience , and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the Executive Departments individuals whose talents , integrity , and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the faithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to their charge . With such aids and an honest purpose to do whatever is right , I hope to execute diligently , impartially , and for the best interests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me . In the discharge of these duties my guide will be the Constitution , which I this day swear to preserve , protect , and defend . For the interpretation of that instrument I shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of the Government under the earlier Presidents , who had so large a share in its formation . To the example of those illustrious patriots I shall always defer with reverence , and especially to his example who was by so many titles the Father of his Country . To command the Army and Navy of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other officers to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary and to take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed these are the most important functions intrusted to the President by the Constitution , and it may be expected that I shall briefly indicate the principles which will control me in their execution . Chosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my Administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country , and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest , I this day renew the declarations I have heretofore made and proclaim my fixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the Government in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public policy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of our national existence . In reference to the Army and Navy , lately employed with so much distinction on active service , care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency , and in furtherance of that object the military and naval schools , sustained by the liberality of Congress , shall receive the special attention of the Executive . As American freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty , but at the same time we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations . In all disputes between conflicting governments it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral , while our geographical position , the genius of our institutions and our people , the advancing spirit of civilization , and , above all , the dictates of religion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations with all other powers . It is to be hoped that no international question can now arise which a government confident in its own strength and resolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise negotiation and it eminently becomes a government like our own , founded on the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their affections , to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before appealing to arms . In the conduct of our foreign relations I shall conform to these views , as I believe them essential to the best interests and the true honor of the country . The appointing power vested in the President imposes delicate and onerous duties . So far as it is possible to be informed , I shall make honesty , capacity , and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of office , and the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal . It shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to Congress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and protection to the great interests of agriculture , commerce , and manufactures , to improve our rivers and harbors , to provide for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt , to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all officers of the Government and the utmost economy in all public expenditures but it is for the wisdom of Congress itself , in which all legislative powers are vested by the Constitution , to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy . I shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that Union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections . In any action calculated to promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his country I will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the Government . In conclusion I congratulate you , my fellow citizens , upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of Divine Providence has conducted our common country . Let us invoke a continuance of the same protecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence we this day occupy , and let us seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our councils , by well directed attempts to assuage the bitterness which too often marks unavoidable differences of opinion , by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal principles , and by an enlarged patriotism , which shall acknowledge no limits but those of our own widespread Republic .<speech_sep>
