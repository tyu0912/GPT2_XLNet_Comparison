Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives In meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public Affairs . The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our Country with plenty , and with the means of a flourishing commerce . The progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American Stock abroad as well as at home . And the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes , have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated . This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources , but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add , as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our Citizens . The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary . In conforming to the powers vested in me by acts of the last Session , a loan of three millions of florins , towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place , has been completed in Holland . As well the celerity with which it has been filled , as the nature of the terms , considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe gives a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success . The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information . Since your last Sessions , I have received communications by which it appears , that the District of Kentucky , at present a part of Virginia , has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that State in consequence of which the District is to become a distinct member of the Union , in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added . For this sanction application is now made . I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you . The liberality and harmony , with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow citizens of Kentucky cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you . It has been heretofore known to Congress , that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the North West side of the Ohio . These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes , and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder , they have , instead of listening to the humane overtures92 made on the part of the United States , renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect . The lives of a number of valuable Citizens have thus been sacrificed , and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity . These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the Western Settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes , than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments . As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the Act , which empowers the President to call out the Militia for the protection of the frontiers . And I have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of Militia as were deemed sufficient . The event of the measure is yet unknown to me . The Secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded , as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended . The disturbed situation of Europe , and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers , whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States , reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings . It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war , among the Nations most concerned in active Commerce with this Country , to abridge the means , and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets . I recommend it to your serious reflexion how far and in what mode , it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies , by such encouragements to our own Navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms , which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of these great objects . Our fisheries , and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil . Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean . So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it distressful to us , that you will not think any deliberations misemployed , which may lead to its relief and protection . The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a Judiciary System have opened the doors of Justice to all descriptions of persons . You will consider in your wisdom , whether improvements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether a uniform process of execution on sentences issuing , from the federal Courts be not desireable through all the states . The patronage of our commerce , of our merchants and Seamen , has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign Countries . It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that Jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them , either by express Convention , or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence . The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases , the aid of the national authority to his Consuls established here . Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect . The establishment of the Militia of a mint of Standards of weights and measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which I presume you will resume of course , and which are abundantly urged by their own importance . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the Revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated , leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged . Allow me , moreover , to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the Interest of the debt funded , but , as far and as fast as the growing resources of the Country will permit , to exonerate it of the principal itself . The appropriation you have made of the Western Lands explains your dispositions on this subject And I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt , the more salutary will the measure be to every public interest , as well as the more satisfactory to our Constituents . Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives In pursuing the various and weighty business of the present Session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom , and animated by the love of your Country . In whatever belongs to my duty , you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire . It will be happy for us both , and our best reward , if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow Citizens , and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence .<speech_sep>Whereas it appears that a state of war exists between Austria , Prussia , Sardinia , Great Britain , and the United Netherlands , on the one part , and France on the other and the duty and interest of the United States require , that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers I have therefore thought fit by these presents , to declare the disposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid towards those powers respectively and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever , which may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition . And I do hereby also make known , that whosoever of the citizens of the United States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations , by committing , aiding or abetting hostilities against any of the said powers , or by carrying to any of them , those articles which are deemed contraband by the modern usage of nations , will not receive the protection of the United States against such punishment or forfeiture and further that I have given instructions to those officers to whom it belongs , to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons , who shall , within the cognizance of the Courts of the United States , violate the law of nations , with respect to the powers at war , or any of them .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives With the utmost attention I have considered your resolution of the 24th . instant , requesting me to lay before your House , a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United States who negotiated the Treaty with the King of Great Britain , together with the correspondence and other documents relative to that Treaty , excepting such of the said papers as any existing negotiation may render improper to be disclosed . In deliberating upon this subject , it was impossible for me to lose sight of the principle which some have avowed in its discussion or to avoid extending my views to the consequences which must flow from the admission of that principle . I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to withhold any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon the President as a duty to give , or which could be required of him by either House of Congress as a right And with truth I affirm , that it has been , as it will continue to be , while I have the honor to preside in the Government , my constant endeavour to harmonize with the other branches thereof so far as the trust delegated to me by the People of the United States , and my sense of the obligation it imposes to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution will permit . The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution and their success must often depend on secrecy and even when brought to a conclusion , a full disclosure of all the measures , demands , or eventual concessions , which may have been proposed or contemplated , would be extremely impolitic for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations or produce immediate inconveniences , perhaps danger and mischief , in relation to other powers . The necessity of such caution and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making Treaties in the President , with the advice and consent of the Senate , the principle on which that body was formed confining it to a small number of Members . To admit then a right in the House of Representatives to demand , and to have as a matter of course , all the Papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign power , would be to establish a dangerous precedent . It does not occur that the inspection of the papers asked for , be relative to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of Representatives , except that of an impeachment , which the resolution has not expressed . I repeat , that I have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of my station will permit , or the public good shall require to be disclosed and in fact , all the Papers affecting the negotiation with Great Britain were laid before the Senate , when the Treaty itself was communicated for their consideration and advice . The course which the debate has taken , on the resolution of the House , leads to some observations on the mode of making treaties under the Constitution of the United States . Having been a member of the General Convention , and knowing the principles on which the Constitution was formed , I have ever entertained but one opinion on this subject and from the first establishment of the Government to this moment , my conduct has exemplified that opinion , that the power of making treaties is exclusively vested in the President , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur , and that every treaty so made , and promulgated , thenceforward became the Law of the land . It is thus that the treaty making power has been understood by foreign Nations and in all the treaties made with them , we have declared , and they have believed , that when ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate , they became obligatory . In this construction of the Constitution every House of Representatives has heretofore acquiesced and until the present time , not a doubt or suspicion has appeared to my knowledge that this construction was not the true one . Nay , they have more than acquiesced for till now , without controverting the obligation of such treaties , they have made all the requisite provisions for carrying them into effect . There is also reason to believe that this construction agrees with the opinions entertained by the State Conventions , when they were deliberating on the Constitution especially by those who objected to it , because there was not required , in commercial treaties , the consent of two thirds of the whole number of the members of the Senate , instead of two thirds of the Senators present and because in treaties respecting territorial and certain other rights and claims , the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both houses respectively , was not made necessary . It is a fact declared by the General Convention , and universally understood , that the Constitution of the United States was the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession . And it is well known that under this influence the smaller States were admitted to an equal representation in the Senate with the larger States and that this branch of the government was invested with great powers for on the equal participation of those powers , the sovereignty and political safety of the smaller States were deemed essentially to depend . If other proofs than these , and the plain letter of the Constitution itself , be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration , they may be found in the journals of the General Convention , which I have deposited in the office of the department of State . In these journals it will appear that a proposition was made , that no Treaty should be binding on the United States which was not ratified by a Law and that the proposition was explicitly rejected . As therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding , that file assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty as the treaty with Great Britain exhibits in itself all the objects requiring legislative provision And on these the papers called for can throw no light And as it is essential to the due administration of the government , that the boundaries fixed by the constitution between the different departments should be preserved A just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my Office , under all the circumstances of this case , forbids a complyance with your request .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself , of congratulating you on the present favourable prospects of our public affairs . The recent accession of the important State of North Carolina to the Constitution of the United States of which official information has been received the rising credit and respectability of our Country the general and increasing good will towards the Government of the Union , and the concord , peace , and plenty , with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree , to our national prosperity . In resuming your consultations for the general good , you cannot but derive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last Session have been as satisfactory to your Constituents , as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope . Still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a Gracious Providence has placed within our reach , will in the course of the present important Session , call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism , firmness and wisdom . Among the many interesting objects , which will engage your attention , that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard . To be prepared for War is one of the most effectual means of perserving peace . A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite And their safety and interest require , that they should promote such manufactories , as tend to render them independent on others for essential , particularly for military supplies . The proper establishment of the Troops , which may be deemed indispensable , will be entitled to mature deliberation . In the arrangements , which may be made respecting it , it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the Officers and Soldiers with a due regard to oeconomy . There was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the Inhabitants of our Southern and Western frontiers from their depredations . But you will perceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall direct to be laid before you comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union and if necessary to punish aggressors . The interests of the United States requires that our intercourse with other nations should be facilitated , by such provisions as will enable me to fulfill my duty in that respect , in the manner which circumstances may render most conducive to the public good And to this end that the compensations to be made to the persons who may be employed , should according to the nature of their appointments , be defined by law and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs . Various considerations also render it expedient , that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of Citizens should be speedily ascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization . Uniformity in the Currency , Weights and Measures of the United States is an object of great importance , and will I am persuaded be duly attended to . The advancement of Agriculture , Commerce and Manufactures by all proper means , will not I trust need recommendation . But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad , as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our Country by a due attention to the Post Office and Post Roads . Nor am I less persuaded , that you will agree with me in opinion , that there is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of Science and Literature . Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness . In one in which the measures of Government receive their impression so immediately from the sense of the Community as in ours it is proportionably essential . To the security of a free Constitution it contributes in various ways By convincing those who are intrusted with the public administration , that every valuable end of Government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights to discern and provide against invasions of them to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of Society to discriminate the spirit of Liberty from that of licentiousness , cherishing the first , avoiding the last , and uniting a speedy , but temperate vigilance against encroachments , with an inviolable respect to the Laws . Whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording aids to seminaries of learning already established , by the institution of a national University , or by any other expedients , will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of the Legislature .<speech_sep>I trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have never met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation , and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy . The termination of the long , expensive , and distressing war in which we have been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region . In the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity . the object , it is believed , has been fully attained . The articles agreed upon will immediately be laid before the Senate for their consideration . The Creek and Cherokee Indians , who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontiers , have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties with us , and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them into effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken . But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders , which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks , which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger , which will be productive of further expense , and may occasion more effusion of blood . Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages , and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert general hostility . A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father , the late Emperor , and consequently the continuance of peace with that power . With peculiar satisfaction I add that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Day and Regency of that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the resolution of our unfortunate fellow citizens from a grievous captivity . The latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give , moreover , the pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation . While the event depending upon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained , it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which , securing amicably very essential interests of the United States , will at the same time lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate . Though not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives , you , gentlemen , are all apprised that a treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation has been negotiated with Great Britain , and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts part of one article . Agreeably thereto , and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation , I have added my sanction . The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown . When received , the subject will without delay be placed before Congress . This interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted , and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding , opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections . If by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity , on terms compatible with our national rights and honor , shall be the happy result , how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating , maturing , and establishing the prosperity of our country . Contemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of the United States , we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction . While many of the nations of Europe , with their American dependencies , have been involved in a contest unusually bloody , exhausting , and calamitous , in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens , which press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of government , our favored country , happy in a striking contrast , has enjoyed tranquillity a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty . Faithful to ourselves , we have violated no obligation to others . Our agriculture , commerce , and manufactures prosper beyond former example , the molestations of our trade to prevent a continuance of which , however , very pointed remonstrances have been made being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position . Our population advances with a celerity which , exceeding the most sanguine calculations , proportionally augments our strength and resources , and guarantees our future security . Every part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived , with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies , with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty , and with mild and wholesome laws , is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed , if ever before equaled Placed in a situation every way so auspicious , motives of commanding force impel us , with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our country , to unite our efforts to preserve , prolong , and improve our immense advantages . To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart . It is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order . The misled have abandoned their errors , and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the society . These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to , and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment . For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested , yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice , dignity , and safety may permit . Gentlemen Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session , a review of our military establishment is not the least important . It is called for by the events which have changed , and may be expected still further to change , the relative situation of our frontiers . In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted , that the war in Europe is not yet terminated , and that our Western posts , when recovered , will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them . A statement of our present military force will be laid before you by the Department of War . With the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia . It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded . The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished . Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object , while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils . While we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes , it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations , namely , that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient . It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity , and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment , all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory . The frequent destruction of innocent women and children , who are chiefly the victims of retaliation , must continue to shock humanity , and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union . To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them . If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress , and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat , as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude , I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent . I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government . The accomplishment of this work , if practicable , will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The state of our revenue , with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress , will be submitted from the proper Department , together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year . Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination . Congress have demonstrated their sense to be , and it were superfluous to repeat mine , that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents . Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect , and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters . The progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building them , the state of the fortifications of our harbors , the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing our magazines with military stores , and the steps which have been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress . Temperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace , happiness , and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine .<speech_sep>I the President of the United States , by my own mouth , and by a written Speech signed with my own hand and sealed with the Seal of the U Speak to the Seneka Nation , and desire their attention , and that they would keep this Speech in remembrance of the friendship of the United States . I have received your Speech with satisfaction , as a proof of your confidence in the justice of the United States , and I have attentively examined the several objects which you have laid before me , whether delivered by your Chiefs at Tioga point in the last month to Colonel Pickering , or laid before me in the present month by the Cornplanter and the other Seneca Chiefs now in Philadelphia . In the first place I observe to you , and I request it may sink deep in your minds , that it is my desire , and the desire of the United States that all the miseries of the late war should be forgotten and buried forever . That in future the United States and the six Nations should be truly brothers , promoting each other s prosperity by acts of mutual friendship and justice . I am not uninformed that the six Nations have been led into some difficulties with respect to the sale of their lands since the peace . But I must inform you that these evils arose before the present government of the United States was established , when the separate States and individuals under their authority , undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands . But the case is now entirely altered . The general Government only has the power , to treat with the Indian Nations , and any treaty formed and held without its authority will not be binding . Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands . No State nor person can purchase your lands , unless at some public treaty held under the authority of the United States . The general government will never consent to your being defrauded . But it will protect you in all your just rights . Hear well , and let it be heard by every person in your Nation , That the President of the United States declares , that the general government considers itself bound to protect you in all the lands secured you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the 22d of October 1784 , excepting such parts as you may since had fairly sold to persons properly authorized to purchase of you . You complain that John Livingston and Oliver Phelps have obtained your lands , assisted by Street of Niagara , and they have not complied with their agreement . It appears upon enquiry of the Governor of New York , that John Livingston was not legally authorized to treat with you , and that every thing he did with you has been declared null and void , so that you may rest easy on that account . But it does not appear from any proofs yet in the possession of government , that Oliver Phelps has defrauded you . If however you should have any just cause of complaint against him , and can make satisfactory proof thereof , the federal Courts will be open to you for redress , as to all other persons . But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining lands , and I have therefore upon this point , meant to be sufficiently strong and clear . That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands . That you possess the right to sell , and the right of refusing to sell your lands . That therefore the sale of your lands in future , will depend entirely upon yourselves . But that when you may find it for your interest to sell any parts of your lands , the United States must be present by their Agent , and will be your security that you shall not be defrauded in the bargain you may make . It will however be important , that before you make any sales of your land that you should determine among yourselves , who are the persons among you that shall give sure conveyances thereof as shall be binding upon your Nation and forever preclude all disputes related to the validity of the sale . That besides the before mentioned security for your land , you will perceive by the law of Congress , for regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes , the fatherly care the United States intend to take of the Indians . For the particular meaning of this law , I refer you to the explanations given thereof by Colonel Pickering at Tioga , which with the law , are herewith delivered to you . You have said in your Speech That the game is going away from among you , and that you thought it the design of the great Spirit , that you should till the ground , but before you speak upon this subject , you want to know whether the United States meant to leave you any land to till You now know that all the lands secured to you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix , excepting such parts as you may since have fairly sold are yours , and that only your own acts can convey them away speak therefore your wishes on the subject of tilling the ground . The United States will be happy to afford you every assistance in the only business which will add to your numbers and happiness . The murders that have been committed upon some of your people , by the bad white men I sincerely lament and reprobate , and I earnestly hope that the real murderers will be secured , and punished as they deserve . This business has been sufficiently explained to you here , by the Governor of Pennsylvania , and by Colonel Pickering on behalf of the United States , at Tioga . The Senekas may be assured , that the rewards offered for apprehending the murderers , will be continued until they are secured for trial , and that when they shall be apprehended , that they will be tried and punished as if they had killed white men . Having answered the most material parts of your Speech , I shall inform you , that some bad Indians , and the outcast of several tribes who reside at the Miamee Village , have long continued their murders and depredations upon the frontiers , lying along the Ohio . That they have not only refused to listen to my voice inviting them to peace , but that upon receiving it , they renewed their incursions and murders with greater violence than ever . I have therefore been obliged to strike those bad people , in order to make them sensible of their madness . I sincerely hope they will hearken to reason , and not require to be further chastised . The United States desire to be the friends of the Indians , upon terms of justice and humanity . But they will not suffer the depredations of the bad Indians to go unpunished . My desire is that you would caution all the Senekas and six Nations , to . prevent their rash young men from joining the Miamee Indians . For the United States cannot distinguish the tribes to which bad Indians belong , and every tribe must take care of their own people . The merits of the Cornplanter , and his friendship for the United States are well known to me , and shall not be forgotten . And as a mark of the esteem of the United States , I have directed the Secretary of war to make him a present of Two hundred and Fifty Dollars , either in money or goods , as the Cornplanter shall like best . And he may depend upon the future care and kindness of the United States . And I have also directed the Secretary of War to make suitable presents to the other Chiefs present in Philadelphia . And also that some further tokens of friendship to be forwarded to the other Chiefs , now in their Nation . Remember my words Senekas , continue to be strong in your friendship for the United States , as the only rational ground of your future happiness , and you may rely upon their kindness and protection . An Agent shall soon be appointed to reside in some place convenient to the Senekas and six Nations . He will represent the United States . Apply to him on all occasions . If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the United States , mark that man as your enemy , for he will mean to deceive you and lead you into trouble . The United States will be true and faithful to their engagements .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate , and of the House of Representatives It is some abatement of the satisfaction , with which I meet you on the present occasion , that in felicitating you on a continuance of the National prosperity , generally , I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities , which have for some time past distressed our North Western frontier , have terminated . You will , I am persuaded , learn , with no less concern than I communicate it , that reiterated endeavors , toward effecting a pacification , have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility , on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest . An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier to stop the further effusion of blood to arrest the progress of expense to forward the prevalent wish of the Nation , for peace , has led , through various channels , to strenuous efforts , to accomplish these desirable purposes In making which efforts , I consulted less my own anticipations of the event , or the scruples , which some considerations were calculated to inspire , than the wish to find the object attainable or if not attainable , to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case . A detail of the measures , which have been pursued , and of their consequences , which will be laid before you , while it will confirm to you the want of success , thus far , will , I trust , evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised , have been employed . The issue of some of them , indeed , is still depending but a favourable one , though not to be despaired of , is not promised by anything that has yet happened . In the course of the attempts which have been made , some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service . A sanction commonly respected even among savages , has been found , in this instance , insufficient to protect from Massacre the emissaries of peace . It will , I presume , be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased . It must add to your concern , to be informed , that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes North of the Ohio , some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it . A part of the Cherokees , known by the name of Chickamagas , inhabitating five Villages on the Tennesee River , have been long in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements . It was hoped that the treaty of Holstin , made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 , would have prevented a repetition of such depredations . But the event has not answered this hope . The Chickamagas , aided by some Banditti of another tribe in their vicinity , have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the Citizens of the United States in that quarter . The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you . Hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed . It is not understood that any breach of Treaty , or aggression whatsoever , on the part of the United States , or their Citizens , is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter . I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war , in the event of a failure of pacific overtures . A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised , has been recruited , though the number is still incomplete . And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed . A delay of operations besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts . A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised , and some other points which have been suggested , will afford more precise information , as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be adviseable . In looking forward to the future expense of the operations , which may be found inevitable , I derive consolation from the information I receive , that the product of the revenues for the present year , is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community , for the service of the ensuing year . This , however , will be better ascertained in the course of the Session and it is proper to add , that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostility . I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier , and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory . To enable , by competent rewards , the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them , as agents , would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood . If , in addition to these expedients , an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes , and for carrying on trade with them , upon a scale equal to their wants , and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion , its influence in cementing their interests with our s could not but be considerable . The prosperous state of our Revenue has been intimated . This would be still more the case , were it not for the impediments , which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States . These impediments have lessened , and are lessening in local extent , and as applied to the community at large , the contentment with the law appears to be progressive . But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters , I judged a special interposition on my part , proper and adviseable and under this impression , have issued a proclamation , warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings , having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question , and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof , and securing obedience thereto . Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders and Congress may be assured , that nothing within Constitutional and legal limits , which may depend on me , shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws . In fulfilling this trust , I shall count intirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of Government , and upon the zealous support of all good Citizens . I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the Judiciary System . A representation from the Judges of the Supreme Court , which will be laid before you , points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced . In the course of the execution of the laws , considerations arise out of the structure of that System , which , in some cases , tend to relax their efficacy . As connected with this subject , provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the Courts of the United States , and supplementary definition of Offences against the Constitution and laws of the Union , and of the punishment for such Offences , will , it is presumed , be found worthy of particular attention . Observations on the value of peace with other Nations are unnecessary . It would be wise , however , by timely provisions , to guard against those acts of our own Citizens , which might tend to disturb it , and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign Nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them . I particularly recommend to your consideration the means of preventing those aggressions by our Citizens on the territory of other nations , and other infractions of the law of Nations , which , furnishing just subject of complaint , might endanger our peace with them . And in general , the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose , which takes place if not renewed , at the close of the present session . In execution of the Authority given by the legislature , measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint others have been employed at home . Provision has been made for the requisite buildings , and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment . There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them . The regulation of foreign Coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage , as being essential to their due operation , and to order in our money concerns , will , I doubt not , be resumed and completed . It is represented that some provisions in the law , which establishes the Post Office , operate , in experiment , against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the Country . Should this , upon due inquiry , be found to be the case , a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information , will , I doubt not , lead to the application of a remedy . 15 Note On December 31 Lear wrote to the Postmaster General In reply to your letter of this date requesting me to inform you of the facts or representations communicated to the President relative to newspapers , which led him to notice them in his Speech at the opening of the present session of Congress I have the honor to inform you that it was represented to the President in such a way as to place the fact beyond a doubt in his mind , that in consequence of the rate of postage imposed on the transmission of Newspapers by the Post office Law , many persons in Virginia who had heretofore taken Newspapers from this City , had declined receiving them any longer and that many others declared that they only continued to take them under a full persuasion that the rate of postage would be reduced during the present Session of Congress , and that if such reduction should not take place , they would desire the printers to stop their papers . In addition to these strong marks of disapprobation of the rate of postage on newspapers given by individuals , he was informed that the public mind , so far as it had been expressed in that quarter on the subject , appeared very anxious that an alteration should take place in that part of the post office Law which relates to the transmission of Newspapers . This letter is entered in the Letter Book in the Washington Papers . The adoption of a Constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified to me . The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the Nation to which it relates , and conducive to the general Order . It is proper likewise to inform you , that since my last communication on the subject , and in further execution of the Acts severally making provision for the public debt , and for the reduction thereof , three new loans have been effected , each for three millions of Florins . One at Antwerp , at the annual interest of four and one half per Cent , with an Allowance of four per Cent in lieu of all charges and the other two at Amsterdam , at the annual interest of four per Cent , with an allowance of five and one half per Cent in one case , and of five per Cent in the other in lieu of all charges . The rates of these loans , and the circumstances under which they have been made , are confirmations of the high state of our Credit abroad . Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied , the payment of the debts due to certain foreign Officers , according to the provision made during the last Session , has been embraced . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a Systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt , according to the right which has been reserved served to the Government . No measure can be more desireable , whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance , or to the general sentiment and wish of the Nation . Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States , pursuant to the eleventh section of the Act by which it is incorporated . In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular , it is expected a valuable saving will be made . Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year , and for such extraordinaries as may require provision , will demand , and , I doubt not , will engage your early attention . Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I content myself with recalling your attention , generally , to such objects , not particularized in my present , as have been suggested in my former communications to you . Various temporary laws will expire during the present Session . Among these , that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian Tribes , will merit particular notice . The results of your common deliberations , hitherto , will , I trust , be productive of solid and durable advantages to our Constituents such as , by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage , will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment to that constitution of Government , upon which , under Divine Providence , materially depend their Union , their safety and their happiness . Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends , there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency , than the careful cultivation of harmony , combined with a due regard to stability , in the public Councils .<speech_sep>
