To the House of Representatives It is with unaffected regret that I find myself constrained by clear conviction to return this bill 6060 , An act to regulate the immigration of aliens to and the residence of aliens in the United States without my signature . Not only do I feel it to be a very serious matter to exercise the power of veto in any case , because it involves opposing the single judgment of the President to the judgment of a majority of both the Houses of the Congress , a step which no man who realizes his own liability to error can take without great hesitation , but also because this particular bill is in so many important respects admirable , well conceived , and desirable . Its enactment into law would undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and improve the methods of handling the important branch of the public service to which it relates . But candor and a sense of duty with regard to the responsibility so clearly imposed upon me by the Constitution in matters of legislation leave me no choice but to dissent . In two particulars of vital consequence this bill embodies a radical departure from the traditional and long established policy of this country , a policy in which our people have conceived the very character of their Government to be expressed , the very mission and spirit of the Nation in respect of its relations to the peoples of the world outside their borders . It seeks to all but close entirely the gates of asylum which have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the right and opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceived to be the natural and inalienable rights of men and it excludes those to whom the opportunities of elementary education have been denied , without regard to their character , their purposes , or their natural capacity . Restrictions like these , adopted earlier in our history as a Nation , would very materially have altered the course and cooled the humane ardors of our politics . The right of political asylum has brought to this country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land , and who has yet become an ornament to our citizenship and to our public councils . The children and the compatriots of these illustrious Americans must stand amazed to see the representatives of their Nation now resolved , in the fullness of our national strength and at the maturity of our great institutions , to risk turning such men back from our shores without test of quality or purpose . It is difficult for me to believe that the full effect of this feature of the bill was realized when it was framed and adopted , and it is impossible for me to assent to it in the form in which it is here cast . The literacy test and the tests and restrictions which accompany it constitute an even more radical change in the policy of the Nation . Hitherto we have generously kept our doors open to all who were not unfitted by reason of disease or incapacity for self support or such personal records and antecedents as were likely to make them a menace to our peace and order or to the wholesome and essential relationships of life . In this bill it is proposed to turn away from tests of character and of quality and impose tests which exclude and restrict for the new tests here embodied are not tests of quality or of character or of personal fitness , but tests of opportunity . Those who come seeking opportunity are not to be admitted unless they have already had one of the chief of the opportunities they seek , the opportunity of education . The object of such provisions is restriction , not selection . If the people of this country have made up their minds to limit the number of immigrants by arbitrary tests and so reverse the policy of all the generations of Americans that have gone before them , it is their right to do so . I am their servant and have no license to stand in their way . But I do not believe that they have . I respectfully submit that no one can quote their mandate to that effect . Has any political party ever avowed a policy of restriction in this fundamental matter , gone to the country on it , and been commissioned to control its legislation Does this bill rest upon the conscious and universal assent and desire of the American people I doubt it . It is because I doubt it that I make bold to dissent from it . I am willing to abide by the verdict , but not until it has been rendered . Let the platforms of parties speak out upon this policy and the people pronounce their wish . The matter is too fundamental to be settled otherwise . I have no pride of opinion in this question . I am not foolish enough to profess to know the wishes and ideals of America better than the body of her chosen representatives know them . I only want instruction direct from those whose fortunes , with ours and all men s , are involved .<speech_sep>GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRES In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of communicating to you from time to time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your consideration such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedient , I shall continue the practice , which I hope has been acceptable to you , of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general public policy with which it seems necessary and feasible to deal at the present session of the Congress . I realize the limitations of time under which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my suggestions as few as possible but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once . In the first place , it seems to me imperatively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public dangers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed , and which still unhappily continue to exist , between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers , conductors and trainmen . I then recommended First , immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the House of Representatives and now awaiting action by the Senate in order that the Commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which are , with its present constitution and means of action , practically impossible . Second , the establishment of an eight hour day as the legal basis alike of work and wages in the employment of all railway employes who are actually engaged in the work of operating trains in interstate transportation . Third , the authorization of the appointment by the President of a small body of men to observe actual results in experience of the adoption of the eight hour day in railway transportation alike for the men and for the railroads . Fourth , explicit approval by the Congress of the consideration by the Interstate Commerce Commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been offset by administrative readjustments and economies , should the facts disclosed justify the increase . Fifth , an amendment of the existing Federal statute which provides for the mediation , conciliation and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that , in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail , a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted . And , sixth , the lodgment in the hands of the Executive of the power , in case of military necessity , to take control of such portions and such rolling stock of the railways of the country as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes , with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and administrative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use . The second and third of these recommendations the Congress immediately acted on it established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and it authorized the appointment of a commission to observe and report upon the practical results , deeming these the measures most immediately needed but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consideration of them . The fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to renew . The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the Congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission s authority or its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either . The other suggestions the increase in the Interstate Commerce Commission s membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes , and the grant to the Executive of the power to control and operate the railways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew . The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing . Those who have entrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard , I believe , to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them . Not only does the Interstate Commerce Commission now find it practically impossible , with its present membership and organization , to perform its great functions promptly and thoroughly , but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting . It must first be perfected as an administrative instrument . The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitration and conciliation which the Congress can easily and promptly supply . And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the Executive to make immediate and uninterrupted use of the railroads for the concentration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed . This is a program of regulation , prevention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it . With regard to one of its items , the increase in the efficiency of the Interstate Commerce Commission , the House of Representatives has already acted its action needs only the concurrence of the Senate . I would hesitate to recommend , and I dare say the Congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it , that any man in any I occupation should be obliged by law to continue in an employment which he desired to leave . To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurisprudence , which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce . But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concerted action of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted , which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation , is not to propose any such principle . It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial processes of the nation , at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employe and employer , time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits , and opportunity to consider all practicable means of conciliation or arbitration . I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by society of the necessary processes of its very life . There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done . It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous regard for the interests and liberties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of society itself . Three matters of capital importance await the action of the Senate which have already been acted upon by the House of Representatives the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in promoting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Rico and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections , commonly called the Corrupt Practices Act . I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law . Their urgency lies in the manifest circumstances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but necessary . Even delay would seriously jeopard the interests of the country and of the Government . Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer , because at least two years will elapse before another election in which Federal offices are to be filled but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent observation , and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience and a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it . Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose . I shall not argue at length the desirability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted effort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade . That enterprise will presently , will immediately assume , has indeed already assumed a magnitude unprecedented in our experience . We have not the necessary instrumentalities for its prosecution it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws . We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license . The thing must be done now , because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay . The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Porto Rico is brief and conclusive . The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just . We have created expectations of extended privilege which we have not satisfied . There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily remove . We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular . We ought to do it at once . At the last session of the Congress a bill was passed by the Senate which provides for the promotion of vocational and industrial education , which is of vital importance to the whole country because it concerns a matter , too long neglected , upon which the thorough industrial preparation of the country for the critical years of economic development immediately ahead of us in very large measure depends . May I not urge its early and favorable consideration by the House of Representatives and its early enactment into law It contains plans which affect all interests and all parts of the country , and I am sure that there is no legislation now pending before the Congress whose passage the country awaits with more thoughtful approval or greater impatience to see a great and admirable thing set in the way of being done . There are other matters already advanced to the stage of conference between the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak . Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found an action taken upon them . Inasmuch as this is , gentlemen , probably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty fourth Congress , I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satisfaction I have co operated with you in the many measures of constructive policy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country . It has been a privilege to labor in such company . I take the liberty of congratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare serviceableness and distinction .<speech_sep>The session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session of the Sixty third Congress , a Congress , I venture to say , which will long be remembered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done , in loyal response to the thought and needs of the country . I should like in this address to review the notable record and try to make adequate assessment of it but no doubt we stand too near the work that has been done and are ourselves too much part of it to play the part of historians toward it . Our program of legislation with regard to the regulation of business is now virtually complete . It has been put forth , as we intended , as a whole , and leaves no conjecture as to what is to follow . The road at last lies clear and firm before business . It is a road which it can travel without fear or embarrassment . It is the road to ungrudged , unclouded success . In it every honest man , every man who believes that the public interest is part of his own interest , may walk with perfect confidence . Moreover , our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past . While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age have been altered by war . What we have done for our own land and our own people we did with the best that was in us , whether of character or of intelligence , with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the principles upon which we were acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult undertaking but it is done . It has passed from our hands . It is now an established part of the legislation of the country . Its usefulness , its effects will disclose themselves in experience . What chiefly strikes us now , as we look about us during these closing days of a year which will be forever memorable in the history of the world , is that we face new tasks , have been facing them these six months , must face them in the months to come , face them without partisan feeling , like men who have forgotten everything but a common duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself and to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and anxious . War has interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes of production . In Europe it is destroying men and resources wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and appalling , There is reason to fear that the time is near , if it be not already at hand , when several of the countries of Europe will find it difficult to do for their people what they have hitherto been always easily able to do , many essential and fundamental things . At any rate , they will need our help and our manifold services as they have never needed them before and we should be ready , more fit and ready than we have ever been . It is of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually supplied with innumerable articles of manufacture and commerce of which they are in constant need and without which their economic development halts and stands still can now get only a small part of what they formerly imported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets . This is particularly true of our own neighbors , the States , great and small , of Central and South America . Their lines of trade have hitherto run chiefly athwart the seas , not to our ports but to the ports of Great Britain and of the older continent of Europe . I do not stop to inquire why , or to make any comment on probable causes . What interests us just now is not the explanation but the fact , and our duty and opportunity in the presence of it . Here are markets which we must supply , and we must find the means of action . The United States , this great people for whom we speak and act , should be ready , as never before , to serve itself and to serve mankind ready with its resources , its energies , its forces of production , and its means of distribution . It is a very practical matter , a matter of ways and means . We have the resources , but are we fully ready to use them And , if we can make ready what we have , have we the means at hand to distribute it We are not fully ready neither have we the means of distribution . We are willing , but we are not fully able . We have the wish to serve and to serve greatly , generously but we are not prepared as we should be . We are not ready to mobilize our resources at once . We are not prepared to use them immediately and at their best , without delay and without waste . To speak plainly , we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our merchant marine . And now , when we need ships , we have not got them . We have year after year debated , without end or conclusion , the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ores and forests and water powers of our national domain in the rich States of the West , when we should have acted and they are still locked up . The key is still turned upon them , the door shut fast at which thousands of vigorous men , full of initiative , knock clamorously for admittance . The water power of our navigable streams outside the national domain also , even in the eastern States , where we have worked and planned for generations , is still not used as it might be , because we will and we will not because the laws we have made do not intelligently balance encouragement against restraint . We withhold by regulation . I have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omissions , even at this short session of a Congress which would certainly seem to have done all the work that could reasonably be expected of it . The time and the circumstances are extraordinary , and so must our efforts be also . Fortunately , two great measures , finely conceived , the one to unlock , with proper safeguards , the resources of the national domain , the other to encourage the use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the generation of power , have already passed the House of Representatives and are ready for immediate consideration and action by the Senate . With the deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage . In them both we turn our backs upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine policy of use and conservation , in the best sense of those words . We owe the one measure not only to the people of that great western country for whose free and systematic development , as it seems to me , our legislation has done so little , but also to the people of the Nation as a whole and we as clearly owe the other fulfillment of our repeated promises that the water power of the country should in fact as well as in name be put at the disposal of great industries which can make economical and profitable use of it , the rights of the public being adequately guarded the while , and monopoly in the use prevented . To have begun such measures and not completed them would indeed mar the record of this great Congress very seriously . I hope and confidently believe that they will be completed . And there is another great piece of legislation which awaits and should receive the sanction of the Senate I mean the bill which gives a larger measure of self government to the people of the Philippines . How better , in this time of anxious questioning and perplexed policy , could we show our confidence in the principles of liberty , as the source as well as the expression of life , how better could we demonstrate our own self possession and steadfastness in the courses of justice and disinterestedness than by thus going calmly forward to fulfill our promises to a dependent people , who will now look more anxiously than ever to see whether we have indeed the liberality , the unselfishness , the courage , the faith we have boasted and professed . I can not believe that the Senate will let this great measure of constructive justice await the action of another Congress . Its passage would nobly crown the record of these two years of memorable labor . But I think that you will agree with me that this does not complete the toll of our duty . How are we to carry our goods to the empty markets of which I have spoken if we have not the ships How are we to build tip a great trade if we have not the certain and content means of transportation upon which all profitable and useful commerce depends And how are we to get the ships if we wait for the trade to develop without them To correct the many mistakes by which we have discouraged and all but destroyed the merchant marine of the country , to retrace the steps by which we have . . it seems almost deliberately , withdrawn our flag from the seas . . except where , here and there , a ship of war is bidden carry it or some wandering yacht displays it , would take a long time and involve many detailed items of legislation , and tile trade which we ought immediately to handle would disappear or find other channels while we debated the items . The case is not unlike that which confronted us when our own continent was to be opened up to settlement and industry , and we needed long lines of railway , extended means of transportation prepared beforehand , if development was not to lag intolerably and wait interminably . We lavishly subsidized the building of transcontinental railroads . We look back upon that with regret now , because the subsidies led to many scandals of which we are ashamed but we know that the railroads had to be built , and if we had it to do over again we should of course build them , but in another way . Therefore I propose another way of providing the means of transportation , which must precede , not tardily follow , the development of our trade with our neighbor states of America . It may seem a reversal of the natural order of things , but it is true , that the routes of trade must be actually opened by many ships and regular sailings and moderate charges before streams of merchandise will flow freely and profitably through them . Hence the pending shipping bill , discussed at the last session but as yet passed by neither House . In my judgment such legislation is imperatively needed and can not wisely be postponed . The Government must open these gates of trade , and open them wide open them before it is altogether profitable to open them , or altogether reasonable to ask private capital to open them at a venture . It is not a question of the Government monopolizing the field . It should take action to make it certain that transportation at reasonable rates will be promptly provided , even where the carriage is not at first profitable and then , when the carriage has become sufficiently profitable to attract and engage private capital , and engage it in abundance , the Government ought to withdraw . I very earnestly hope that the Congress will be of this opinion , and that both Houses will adopt this exceedingly important bill . The great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with , and it is a matter of deep regret that the difficulties of the subject have seemed to render it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this session . But it can not be perfected yet , and therefore there are no other constructive measures the necessity for which I will at this time call your attention to but I would be negligent of a very manifest duty were I not to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the proposed convention for safety at sea awaits its confirmation and that the limit fixed in the convention itself for its acceptance is the last day of the present month . The conference in which this convention originated was called by the United States the representatives of the United States played a very influential part indeed in framing the provisions of the proposed convention and those provisions are in themselves for the most part admirable . It would hardly be consistent with the part we have played in the whole matter to let it drop and go by the board as if forgotten and neglected . It was ratified in May by the German Government and in August by the Parliament of Great Britain . It marks a most hopeful and decided advance in international civilization . We should show our earnest good faith in a great matter by adding our own acceptance of it . There is another matter of which I must make special mention , if I am to discharge my conscience , lest it should escape your attention . It may seem a very small thing . It affects only a single item of appropriation . But many human lives and many great enterprises hang upon it . It is the matter of making adequate provision for the survey and charting of our coasts . It is immediately pressing and exigent in connection with the immense coast line of Alaska , a coast line greater than that of the United States themselves , though it is also very important indeed with regard to the older coasts of the continent . We can not use our great Alaskan domain , ships will not ply thither , if those coasts and their many hidden dangers are not thoroughly surveyed and charted . The work is incomplete at almost every point . Ships and lives have been lost in threading what were supposed to be well known main channels . We have not provided adequate vessels or adequate machinery for the survey and charting . We have used old vessels that were not big enough or strong enough and which were so nearly unseaworthy that our inspectors would not have allowed private owners to send them to sea . This is a matter which , as I have said , seems small , but is in reality very great . Its importance has only to be looked into to be appreciated . Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics , much discussed out of doors , upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear , definite , and steadfast One of these is economy in government expenditures . The duty of economy is not debatable . It is manifest and imperative . In the appropriations we pass we are spending the money of the great people whose servants we are , not our own . We are trustees and responsible stewards in the spending . The only thing debatable and upon which we should be careful to make our thought and purpose clear is the kind of economy demanded of us . I assert with the greatest confidence that the people of the United States are not jealous of the amount their Government costs if they are sure that they get what they need and desire for the outlay , that the money is being spent for objects of which they approve , and that it is being applied with good business sense and management . Governments grow , piecemeal , both in their tasks and in the means by which those tasks are to be performed , and very few Governments are organized , I venture to say , as wise and experienced business men would organize them if they had a clean sheet of paper to write upon . Certainly the Government of the United States is not . I think that it is generally agreed that there should be a systematic reorganization and reassembling of its parts so as to secure greater efficiency and effect considerable savings in expense . But the amount of money saved in that way would , I believe , though no doubt considerable in itself , running , it may be , into the millions , be relatively small , small , I mean , in proportion to the total necessary outlays of the Government . It would be thoroughly worth effecting , as every saving would , great or small . Our duty is not altered by the scale of the saving . But my point is that the people of the United States do not wish to curtail the activities of this Government they wish , rather , to enlarge them and with every enlargement , with the mere growth , indeed , of the country itself , there must come , of course , the inevitable increase of expense . The sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected , and ought to be effected , by a careful study and assessment of the tasks to be performed and the money spent ought to be made to yield the best possible returns in efficiency and achievement . And , like good stewards , we should so account for every dollar of our appropriations as to make it perfectly evident what it was spent for and in what way it was spent . It is not expenditure but extravagance that we should fear being criticized for not paying for the legitimate enterprise and undertakings of a great Government whose people command what it should do , but adding what will benefit only a few or pouring money out for what need not have been undertaken at all or might have been postponed or better and more economically conceived and carried out . The Nation is not niggardly it is very generous . It will chide us only if we forget for whom we pay money out and whose money it is we pay . These are large and general standards , but they are not very difficult of application to particular cases . The other topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the principles of our national life and policy . It is the subject of national defense . It can not be discussed without first answering some very searching questions . It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war . What is meant by being prepared Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief notice to put a nation in the field , a nation of men trained to arms Of course we are not ready to do that and we shall never be in time of peace so long as we retain our present political principles and institutions . And what is it that it is suggested we should be prepared to do To defend ourselves against attack We have always found means to do that , and shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling our people away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military service in times of peace . Allow me to speak with great plainness and directness upon this great matter and to avow my convictions with deep earnestness . I have tried to know what America is , what her people think , what they are , what they most cherish and hold dear . I hope that some of their finer passions are in my own heart , some of the great conceptions and desires which gave birth to this Government and which have made the voice of this people a voice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world , and that , speaking my own thoughts , I shall , at least in part , speak theirs also , however faintly and inadequately , upon this vital matter . We are at peace with all the world . No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a just and candid interpretation of realities can say that there is reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or the integrity of our territory is threatened . Dread of the power of any other nation we are incapable of . We are not jealous of rivalry in the fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement . We mean to live our own lives as we will but we mean also to let live . We are , indeed , a true friend to all the nations of the world , because we threaten none , covet the possessions of none , desire the overthrow of none . Our friendship can be accepted and is accepted without reservation , because it is offered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect . Therein lies our greatness . We are the champions of peace and of concord . And we should be very jealous of this distinction which we have sought to earn . just now we should be particularly jealous of it because it is our dearest present hope that this character and reputation may presently , in God s providence , bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been vouchsafed any nation , the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a healing settlement of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted the friendship of nations . This is the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self possession , our influence by preserving our ancient principles of action . From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments . We never have had , and while we retain our present principles and ideals we never shall have , a large standing army . If asked , Are you ready to defend yourselves we reply , Most assuredly , to the utmost and yet we shall not turn America into a military camp . We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves . There is another sort of energy in us . It will know how to declare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise . And especially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful to make our moral insurance against the spread of the conflagration very definite and certain and adequate indeed . Let us remind ourselves , therefore , of the only thing we can do or will do . We must depend in every time of national peril , in the future as in the past , not upon a standing army , nor yet upon a reserve army , but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms . It will be right enough , right American policy , based upon our accustomed principles and practices , to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the training may be made familiar with the use of modern arms , the rudiments of drill and maneuver , and the maintenance and sanitation of camps . We should encourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our young men will learn to value . It is right that we should provide it not only , but that we should make it as attractive as possible , and so induce our young men to undergo it at such times as they can command a little freedom and can seek the physical development they need , for mere health s sake , if for nothing more . Every means by which such things can be stimulated is legitimate , and such a method smacks of true American ideas . It is right , too , that the National Guard of the States should be developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the established policy of our Government . And this , also , not because the time or occasion specially calls for such measures , but because it should be our constant policy to make these provisions for our national peace and safety . More than this carries with it a reversal of the whole history and character of our polity . More than this , proposed at this time , permit me to say , would mean merely that we had lost our self possession , that we had been thrown off our balance by a war with which we have nothing to do , whose causes can not touch us , whose very existence affords us opportunities of friendship and disinterested service which should make us ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for trouble . This is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a government like ours were raised up , the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting concord which is based on justice and fair and generous dealing . A powerful navy we have always regarded as our proper and natural means of defense , and it has always been of defense that we have thought , never of aggression or of conquest . But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas , in the future as in the past and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in that . Our ships are our natural bulwarks . When will the experts tell us just what kind we should construct and when will they be right for ten years together , if the relative efficiency of craft of different kinds and uses continues to change as we have seen it change under our very eyes in these last few months But I turn away from the subject . It is not new . There is no new need to discuss it . We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some amongst us are nervous and excited . We shall easily and sensibly agree upon a policy of defense . The question has not changed its aspects because the times are not normal . Our policy will not be for an occasion . It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing , which we will pursue at all seasons , without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the world , the abiding friendship of states , and the unhampered freedom of all with whom we deal . Let there be no misconception . The country has been misinformed . We have not been negligent of national defense . We are not unmindful of the great responsibility resting upon us . We shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new circumstance and what is needed will be adequately done . I close , as I began , by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of peace which challenge our best powers and invite us to build what will last , the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times with free hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we possess . To develop our life and our resources to supply our own people , and the people of the world as their need arises , from the abundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trade to enrich the commerce of our own States and of the world with the products of our mines , our farms , and our factories , with the creations of our thought and the fruits of our character , this is what will hold our attention and our enthusiasm steadily , now and in the years to come , as we strive to show in our life as a nation what liberty and the inspirations of an emancipated spirit may do for men and for societies , for individuals , for states , and for mankind .<speech_sep>My Fellow Countrymen I suppose that every thoughtful man in America has asked himself , during these last troubled weeks , what influence the European war may exert upon the United States , and I take the liberty of addressing a few words to you in order to point out that it is entirely within our own choice what its effects upon us will be and to urge very earnestly upon you the sort of speech and conduct which will best safeguard the Nation against distress and disaster . The effect of the war upon the United States will depend upon what American citizens say and do . Every man who really loves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality , which is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned . The spirit of the Nation in this critical matter will be determined largely by what individuals and society and those gathered in public meetings do and say , upon what newspapers and magazines contain , upon what ministers utter in their pulpits , and men proclaim as their opinions on the street . The people of the United States are drawn from many nations , and chiefly from the nations now at war . It is natural and inevitable that there should be the utmost variety of sympathy and desire among them with regard to the issues and circumstances of the conflict . Some will wish one nation , others another , to succeed in the momentous struggle . It will be easy to excite passion and difficult to allay it . Those responsible for exciting it will assume a heavy responsibility , responsibility for no less a thing than that the people of the United States , whose love of their country and whose loyalty to its Government should unite them as Americans all , bound in honor and affection to think first of her and her interests , may be divided in camps of hostile opinion , hot against each other , involved in the war itself in impulse and opinion if not in action . Such divisions among us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace , the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation , not as a partisan , but as a friend . I venture , therefore , my fellow countrymen , to speak a solemn word of warning to you against that deepest , most subtle , most essential breach of neutrality which may spring out of partisanship , out of passionately taking sides . The United States must be neutral in fact as well as in name during these days that are to try men s souls . We must be impartial in thought as well as in action , must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another . My thought is of America . I am speaking , I feel sure , the earnest wish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great country of ours , which is , of course , the first in our thoughts and in our hearts , should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a Nation fit beyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment , the dignity of self control , the efficiency of dispassionate action a Nation that neither sits in judgment upon others nor is disturbed in her own counsels and which keeps herself fit and free to do what is honest and disinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the world . Shall we not resolve to put upon ourselves the restraints which will bring to our people the happiness and the great and lasting influence for peace we covet for them<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Congress In my report on the state of the Union , which I had the privilege of reading to you on the 2d of December last , I ventured to reserve for discussion at a later date the subject of additional legislation regarding the very difficult and intricate matter of trusts and monopolies . The time now seems opportune to turn to that great question not only because the currency legislation , which absorbed your attention and the attention of the country in December , is now disposed of , but also because opinion seems to be clearing about us with singular rapidity in this other great field of action . In the matter of the currency it cleared suddenly and very happily after the much debated Act was passed in respect of the monopolies which have multiplied about us and in regard to the various means by which they have been organized and maintained it seems to be coming to a clear and all but universal agreement in anticipation of our action , as if by way of preparation , making the way easier to see and easier to set out upon with confidence and without confusion of counsel . Legislation has its atmosphere like everything else , and the atmosphere of accommodation and mutual understanding which we now breathe with so much refreshment is matter of sincere congratulation . It ought to make our task very much less difficult and embarrassing than it would have been had we been obliged to continue to act amidst the atmosphere of suspicion and antagonism which has so long made it impossible to approach such questions with dispassionate fairness . Constructive legislation , when successful , is always the embodiment of convincing experience , and of the mature public opinion which finally springs out of that experience . Legislation is a business of interpretation , not of origination and it is now plain what the opinion is to which we must give effect in this matter . It is not recent or hasty opinion . It springs out of the experience of a whole generation . It has clarified itself by long contest , and those who for a long time battled with it and sought to change it are now frankly and honorably yielding to it and seeking to conform their actions to it . The great business men who organized and financed monopoly and those who administered it in actual everyday transactions have year after year , until now , either denied its existence or justified it as necessary for the effective maintenance and development of the vast business processes of the country in the modern circumstances of trade and manufacture and finance but all the while opinion has made head against them . The average business man is convinced that the ways of liberty are also the ways of peace and the ways of success as well and at last the masters of business on the great scale have begun to yield their preference and purpose , perhaps their judgment also , in honorable surrender . What we are purposing to do , therefore , is , happily , not to hamper or interfere with business as enlightened business men prefer to do it , or in any sense to put it under the ban . The antagonism between business and government is over . We are now about to give expression to the best business judgment of America , to what we know to be the business conscience and honor of the land . The Government and business men are ready to meet each other half way in a common effort to square business methods with both public opinion and the law . The best informed men of the business world condemn the methods and processes and consequences of monopoly as we condemn them and the instinctive judgment of the vast majority of business men everywhere goes with them . We shall now be their spokesmen . That is the strength of our position and the sure prophecy of what will ensue when our reasonable work is done . When serious contest ends , when men unite in opinion and purpose , those who are to change their ways of business joining with those who ask for the change , it is possible to effect it in the way in which prudent and thoughtful and patriotic men would wish to see it brought about with as few , as slight , as easy and simple business readjustments as possible in the circumstances , nothing essential disturbed , nothing torn up by the roots , no parts rent asunder which can be left in wholesome combination . Fortunately , no measures of sweeping or novel change are necessary . It will be understood that our object is not to unsettle business or anywhere seriously to break its established courses athwart . On the contrary , we desire the laws we are now about to pass to be the bulwarks and safeguards of industry against the forces that have disturbed it . What we have to do can be done in a new spirit , in thoughtful moderation , without revolution of any untoward kind . We are all agreed that private monopoly is indefensible and intolerable , and our program is founded upon that conviction . It will be a comprehensive but not a radical or unacceptable program and these are its items , the changes which opinion deliberately sanctions and for which business waits It waits with acquiescence , in the first place , for laws which will effectually prohibit and prevent such interlockings of the personnel of the directorates of great corporations banks and railroads , industrial , commercial , and public service bodies as in effect result in making those who borrow and those who lend practically one and the same , those who sell and those who buy but the same persons trading with one another under different names and in different combinations , and those who affect to compete in fact partners and masters of some whole field of business . Sufficient time should be allowed , of course , in which to effect these changes of organization without inconvenience or confusion . Such a prohibition will work much more than a mere negative good by correcting the serious evils which have arisen because , for example , the men who have been the directing spirits of the great investment banks have usurped the place which belongs to independent industrial management working in its own behoof . It will bring new men , new energies , a new spirit of initiative , new blood , into the management of our great business enterprises . It will open the field of industrial development and origination to scores of men who have been obliged to serve when their abilities entitled them to direct . It will immensely hearten the young men coming on and will greatly enrich the business activities of the whole country . In the second place , business men as well as those who direct public affairs now recognize , and recognize with painful clearness , the great harm and injustice which has been done to many , if not all , of the great railroad systems of the country by the way in which they have been financed and their own distinctive interests subordinated to the interests of the men who financed them and of other business enterprises which those men wished to promote . The country is ready , therefore , to accept , and accept with relief as well as approval , a law which will confer upon the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to superintend and regulate the financial operations by which the railroads are henceforth to be supplied with the money they need for their proper development to meet the rapidly growing requirements of the country for increased and improved facilities of transportation . We cannot postpone action in this matter without leaving the railroads exposed to many serious handicaps and hazards and the prosperity of the railroads and the prosperity of the country are inseparably connected . Upon this question those who are chiefly responsible for the actual management and operation of the railroads have spoken very plainly and very earnestly , with a purpose we ought to be quick to accept . It will be one step , and a very important one , toward the necessary separation of the business of production from the business of transportation . The business of the country awaits also , has long awaited and has suffered because it could not obtain , further and more explicit legislative definition of the policy and meaning of the existing antitrust law . Nothing hampers business like uncertainty . Nothing daunts or discourages it like the necessity to take chances , to run the risk of falling under the condemnation of the law before it can make sure just what the law is . Surely we are sufficiently familiar with the actual processes and methods of monopoly and of the many hurtful restraints of trade to make definition possible , at any rate up to the limits of what experience has disclosed . These practices , being now abundantly disclosed , can be explicitly and item by item forbidden by statute in such terms as will practically eliminate uncertainty , the law itself and the penalty being made equally plain . And the business men of the country desire something more than that the menace of legal process in these matters be made explicit and intelligible . They desire the advice , the definite guidance and information which can be supplied by an administrative body , an interstate trade commission . The opinion of the country would instantly approve of such a commission . It would not wish to see it empowered to make terms with monopoly or in any sort to assume control of business , as if the Government made itself responsible . It demands such a commission only as an indispensable instrument of information and publicity , as a clearing house for the facts by which both the public mind and the managers of great business undertakings should be guided , and as an instrumentality for doing justice to business where the processes of the courts or the natural forces of correction outside the courts are inadequate to adjust the remedy to the wrong in a way that will meet all the equities and circumstances of the case . Producing industries , for example , which have passed the point up to which combination may be consistent with the public interest and the freedom of trade , cannot always be dissected into their component units as readily as railroad companies or similar organizations can be . Their dissolution by ordinary legal process may oftentimes involve financial consequences likely to overwhelm the security market and bring upon it breakdown and confusion . There ought to be an administrative commission capable of directing and shaping such corrective processes , not only in aid of the courts but also by independent suggestion , if necessary . Inasmuch as our object and the spirit of our action in these matters is to meet business half way in its processes of self correction and disturb its legitimate course as little as possible , we ought to see to it , and the judgment of practical and sagacious men of affairs everywhere would applaud us if we did see to it , that penalties and punishments should fall , not upon business itself , to its confusion and interruption , but upon the individuals who use the instrumentalities of business to do things which public policy and sound business practice condemn . Every act of business is done at the command or upon the initiative of some ascertainable person or group of persons . These should be held individually responsible and the punishment should fall upon them , not upon the business organization of which they make illegal use . It should be one of the main objects of our legislation to divest such persons of their corporate cloak and deal with them as with those who do not represent their corporations , but merely by deliberate intention break the law . Business men the country through would , I am sure , applaud us if we were to take effectual steps to see that the officers and directors of great business bodies were prevented from bringing them and the business of the country into disrepute and danger . Other questions remain which will need very thoughtful and practical treatment . Enterprises , in these modern days of great individual fortunes , are oftentimes interlocked , not by being under the control of the same directors , but by the fact that the greater part of their corporate stock is owned by a single person or group of persons who are in some way ultimately related in interest . We are agreed , I take it , that holding companies should be prohibited , but what of the controlling private ownership of individuals or actually cooperative groups of individuals Shall the private owners of capital stock be suffered to be themselves in effect holding companies We do not wish , I suppose , to forbid the purchase of stocks by any person who pleases to buy them in such quantities as he can afford , or in any way arbitrarily to limit the sale of stocks to bona fide purchasers . Shall we require the owners of stock , when their voting power in several companies which ought to be independent of one another would constitute actual control , to make election in which of them they will exercise their right to vote This question I venture for your consideration . There is another matter in which imperative considerations of justice and fair play suggest thoughtful remedial action . Not only do many of the combinations effected or sought to be effected in the industrial world work an injustice upon the public in general they also directly and seriously injure the individuals who are put out of business in one unfair way or another by the many dislodging and exterminating forces of combination . I hope that we shall agree in giving private individuals who claim to have been injured by these processes the right to found their suits for redress upon the facts and judgments proved and entered in suits by the Government where the Government has upon its own initiative sued the combinations complained of and won its suit , and that the statute of limitations shall be suffered to run against such litigants only from the date of the conclusion of the Government s action . It is not fair that the private litigant should be obliged to set up and establish again the facts which the Government has proved . He cannot afford , he has not the power , to make use of such processes of inquiry as the Government has command of . Thus shall individual justice be done while the processes of business are rectified and squared with the general conscience . I have laid the case before you , no doubt as it lies in your own mind , as it lies in the thought of the country . What must every candid man say of the suggestions I have laid before you , of the plain obligations of which I have reminded you That these are new things for which the country is not prepared No but that they are old things , now familiar , and must of course be undertaken if we are to square our laws with the thought and desire of the country . Until these things are done , conscientious business men the country over will be unsatisfied . They are in these things our mentors and colleagues . We are now about to write the additional articles of our constitution of peace , the peace that is honor and freedom and prosperity .<speech_sep>GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRES The year that has elapsed since I last stood before you to fulfil my constitutional duty to give to the Congress from time to time information on the state of the Union has been so crowded with great events , great processes , and great results that I cannot hope to give you an adequate picture of its transactions or of the far reaching changes which have been wrought of our nation and of the world . You have yourselves witnessed these things , as I have . it is too soon to assess them and we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them are less qualified than men of another generation will be to say what they mean , or even what they have been . But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute , in a sense , part of the public business with which it is our duty to deal . To state them is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which must grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine . A year ago we had sent 145 , 918 men overseas . Since then we have sent 1 , 950 , 513 , an average of 162 , 542 each month , the number in fact rising , in May last , to 245 , 951 , in June to 278 , 760 , in July to 307 , 182 , and continuing to reach similar figures in August and September , in August 289 , 570 and in September 257 , 438 . No such movement of troops ever took place before , across three thousand miles of sea , followed by adequate equipment and supplies , and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of attack , dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult to guard against . In all this movement only seven hundred and fifty eight men were lost by enemy attack , six hundred and thirty of whom were upon a single English transport which was sunk near the Orkney Islands . I need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and material . It is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting organization of the industries of the country and of all its productive activities more complete , more thorough in method and effective in result , more spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any other great belligerent had been able to effect . We profited greatly by the experience of the nations which had already been engaged for nearly three years in the exigent and exacting business , their every resource and every executive proficiency taxed to the utmost . We were their pupils . But we learned quickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of cooperation that justify our great pride that we were able to serve the world with unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment . But it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation , supply , equipment and despatch that I would dwell upon , but the mettle and quality of the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept the seas , and the spirit of the nation that stood behind them . No soldiers or sailors ever proved themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test . Those of us who played some part in directing the great processes by which the war was pushed irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight our thoughts with the story of what our men did . Their officers understood the grim and exacting task they had undertaken and performed it with an audacity , efficiency , and unhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with imperishable distinction at every turn , whether the enterprise were great or small , from their great chiefs , Pershing and Sims , down to the youngest lieutenant and their men were worthy of them , such men as hardly need to be commanded , and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence of those who know just what it is they would accomplish . I am proud to be the fellowcountryman of men of such stuff and valor . Those of us who stayed at home did our duty the war could not have been won or the gallant men who fought it given their opportunity to win it otherwise but for many a long day we shall think ourselves accurs d we were not there , and hold our manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with these at Mihiel or Thierry . The memory of those days of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves and each will have his favorite memory . Old men forget yet all shall be forgot , but he will remember with advantages what feats he did that day What we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went in force into the line of battle just at the critical moment when the whole fate of the world seemed to hang in the balance and threw their fresh strength into the ranks of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle , turn it once for all , so that thenceforth it was back , back , back for their enemies , always back , never again forward After that it was only a scant four months before the commanders of the Central Empires knew themselves beaten and now their very empires are in liquidation And throughout it all how fine the spirit of the nation was what unity of purpose , what untiring zeal What elevation of purpose ran through all its splendid display of strength , its untiring accomplishment I have said that those of us who stayed at home to do the work of organization and supply will always wish that we had been with the men whom we sustained by our labor but we can never be ashamed . It has been an inspiring thing to be here in the midst of fine men who had turned aside from every private interest of their own and devoted the whole of their trained capacity to the tasks that supplied the sinews of the whole great undertaking The patriotism , the unselfishness , the thoroughgoing devotion and distinguished capacity that marked their toilsome labors , day after day , month after month , have made them fit mates and comrades of the men in the trenches and on the sea . And not the men here in Washington only . They have but directed the vast achievement . Throughout innumerable factories , upon innumerable farms , in the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines , wherever the stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared , in the shipyards , on the railways , at the docks , on the sea , in every labor that was needed to sustain the battle lines , men have vied with each other to do their part and do it well . They can look any man at arms in the face , and say , We also strove to win and gave the best that was in us to make our fleets and armies sure of their triumph And what shall we say of the women , of their instant intelligence , quickening every task that they touched their capacity for organization and cooperation , which gave their action discipline and enhanced the effectiveness of everything they attempted their aptitude at tasks to which they had . never before set their hands their utter selfsacrifice alike in what they did and in what they gave Their contribution to the great result is beyond appraisal . They have added a new lustre to the annals of American womanhood . The least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in political rights as they have proved themselves their equals in every field of practical work they have entered , whether for themselves or for their country . These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of justice . Besides the immense practical services they have rendered the women of the country have been the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which our people have voluntarily assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the world and the armies upon every front with food and everything else that we had that might serve the common cause . The details of such a story can never be fully written , but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we can say that we are the kinsmen of such . And now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was made . It has come , come in its completeness , and with the pride and inspiration of these days of achievement quick within us , we turn to the tasks of peace again , a peace secure against the violence of irresponsible monarchs and ambitious military coteries and made ready for a new order , for new foundations of justice and fair dealing . We are about to give order and organization to this peace not only for ourselves but for the other peoples of the world as well , so far as they will suffer us to serve them . It is international justice that we seek , not domestic safety merely . Our thoughts have dwelt of late upon Europe , upon Asia , upon the near and the far East , very little upon the acts of peace and accommodation that wait to be performed at our own doors . While we are adjusting our relations with the rest of the world is it not of capital importance that we should clear away all grounds of misunderstanding with our immediate neighbors and give proof of the friendship we really feel I hope that the members of the Senate will permit me to speak once more of the unratified treaty of friendship and adjustment with the Republic of Colombia . I very earnestly urge upon them an early and favorable action upon that vital matter . I believe that they will feel , with me , that the stage of affairs is now set for such action as will be not only just but generous and in the spirit of the new age upon which we have so happily entered . So far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return to peace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment . That problem is less serious for us than it may turn out too he for the nations which have suffered the disarrangements and the losses of war longer than we . Our people , moreover , do not wait to be coached and led . They know their own business , are quick and resourceful at every readjustment , definite in purpose , and self reliant in action . Any leading strings we might seek to put them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled because they would pay no attention to them and go their own way . All that we can do as their legislative and executive servants is to mediate the process of change here , there , and elsewhere as we may . I have heard much counsel as to the plans that should be formed and personally conducted to a happy consummation , but from no quarter have I seen any general scheme of reconstruction emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited business men and self reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience . While the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the industries of the country in the services it was necessary for them to render , by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the materials needed , by which to check undertakings that could for the time be dispensed with and stimulate those that were most serviceable in war , by which to gain for the purchasing departments of the Government a certain control over the prices of essential articles and materials , by which to restrain trade with alien enemies , make the most of the available shipping , and systematize financial transactions , both public and private , so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion , by which , in short , to put every material energy of the country in harness to draw the common load and make of us one team in the accomplishment of a great task . But the moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off . Raw materials upon which the Government had kept its hand for fear there should not be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been released and put into the general market again . Great industrial plants whose whole output and machinery had been taken over for the uses of the Government have been set free to return to the uses to which they were put before the war . It has not been possible to remove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuffs and of shipping , because the world has still to be fed from our granaries and the ships are still needed to send supplies to our men overseas and to bring the men back as fast as the disturbed conditions on the other side of the water permit but even there restraints are being relaxed as much as possible and more and more as the weeks go by Never before have there been agencies in existence in this country which knew so much of the field of supply , of labor , and of industry as the War Industries Board , the War Trade Board , the Labor Department , the Food Administration , and the Fuel Administration have known since their labors became thoroughly systematized and they have not been isolated agencies they have been directed by men who represented the permanent Departments of the Government and so have been the centres of unified and cooperative action . It has been the policy of the Executive , therefore , since the armistice was assured which is in effect a complete submission of the enemy to put the knowledge of these bodies at the disposal of the business men of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point and in every matter where it was desired . It is surprising how fast the process of return to a peace footing has moved in the three weeks since the fighting stopped . It promises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted and any aid that may be offered . It will not be easy to direct it any better than it will direct itself . The American business man is of quick initiative . The ordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not , however , provide immediate employment for all of the men of our returning armies . Those who are of trained capacity , those who are skilled workmen , those who have acquired familiarity with established businesses , those who are ready and willing to go to the farms , all those whose aptitudes are known or will be sought out by employers will find no difficulty , it is safe to say , in finding place and employment . But there will be others who will be at a loss where to gain a livelihood unless pains are taken to guide them and put them in the way of work . There will be a large floating residuum of labor which should not be left wholly to shift for itself . It seems to me important , therefore , that the development of public works of every sort should be promptly resumed , in order that opportunities should be created for unskilled labor in particular , and that plans should be made for such developments of our unused lands and our natural resources as we have hitherto lacked stirnulation to undertake . I particularly direct your attention to the very practical plans which the Secretary of the Interior has developed in his annual report and before your Committees for the reclamation of arid , swamp , and cutover lands which might , if the States were willing and able to cooperate , redeem some three hundred million acres of land for cultivation . There are said to be fifteen or twenty million acres of land in the West , at present arid , for whose reclamation water is available , if properly conserved . There are about two hundred and thirty million acres from which the forests have been cut but which have never yet been cleared for the plow and which lie waste and desolate . These lie scattered all over the Union . And there are nearly eighty million acres of land that lie under swamps or subject to periodical overflow or too wet for anything but grazing , which it is perfectly feasible to drain and protect and redeem . The Congress can at once direct thousands of the returning soldiers to the reclamation of the arid lands which it has already undertaken , if it will but enlarge the plans and appropriations which it has entrusted to the Department of the Interior . It is possible in dealing with our unused land to effect a great rural and agricultural development which will afford the best sort of opportunity to men who want to help themselves and the Secretary of the Interior has thought the possible methods out in a way which is worthy of your most friendly attention . I have spoken of the control which must yet for a while , perhaps for a long long while , be exercised over shipping because of the priority of service to which our forces overseas are entitled and which should also be accorded the shipments which are to save recently liberated peoples from starvation and many devasted regions from permanent ruin . May I not say a special word about the needs of Belgium and northern France No sums of money paid by way of indemnity will serve of themselves to save them from hopeless disadvantage for years to come . Something more must be done than merely find the money . If they had money and raw materials in abundance to morrow they could not resume their place in the industry of the world to morrow , the very important place they held before the flame of war swept across them . Many of their factories are razed to the ground . Much of their machinery is destroyed or has been taken away . Their people are scattered and many of their best workmen are dead . Their markets will be taken by others , if they are not in some special way assisted to rebuild their factories and replace their lost instruments of manufacture . They should not be left to the vicissitudes of the sharp competition for materials and for industrial facilities which is now to set in . I hope , therefore , that the Congress will not be unwilling , if it should become necessary , to grant to some such agency as the War Trade Board the right to establish priorities of export and supply for the benefit of these people whom we have been so happy to assist in saving from the German terror and whom we must not now thoughtlessly leave to shift for themselves in a pitiless competitive market . For the steadying , and facilitation of our own domestic business readjustments nothing is more important than the immediate determination of the taxes that are to be levied for 1918 , 1919 , and 1920 . As much of the burden of taxation must be lifted from business as sound methods of financing the Government will permit , and those who conduct the great essential industries of the country must be told as exactly as possible what obligations to the Government they will be expected to meet in the years immediately ahead of them . It will be of serious consequence to the country to delay removing all uncertainties in this matter a single day longer than the right processes of debate justify . It is idle to talk of successful and confident business reconstruction before those uncertainties are resolved . If the war had continued it would have been necessary to raise at least eight billion dollars by taxation payable in the year 1919 but the war has ended and I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that it will be safe to reduce the amount to six billions . An immediate rapid decline in the expenses of the Government is not to be looked for . Contracts made for war supplies will , indeed , be rapidly cancelled and liquidated , but their immediate liquidation will make heavy drains on the Treasury for the months just ahead of us . The maintenance of our forces on the other side of the sea is still necessary . A considerable proportion of those forces must remain in Europe during the period of occupation , and those which are brought home will be transported and demobilized at heavy expense for months to come . The interest on our war debt must of course be paid and provision made for the retirement of the obligations of the Government which represent it . But these demands will of course fall much below what a continuation of military operations would have entailed and six billions should suffice to supply a sound foundation for the financial operations of the year . I entirely concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending that the two billions needed in addition to the four billions provided by existing law be obtained from the profits which have accrued and shall accrue from war contracts and distinctively war business , but that these taxes be confined to the war profits accruing in 1918 , or in 1919 from business originating in war contracts . I urge your acceptance of his recommendation that provision be made now , not subsequently , that the taxes to be paid in 1920 should be reduced from six to four billions . Any arrangements less definite than these would add elements of doubt and confusion to the critical period of industrial readjustment through which the country must now immediately pass , and which no true friend of the nation s essential business interests can afford to be responsible for creating or prolonging . Clearly determined conditions , clearly and simply charted , are indispensable to the economic revival and rapid industrial development which may confidently be expected if we act now andsweep all interrogation points away . I take it for granted that the Congress will carry out the naval programme which was undertaken before we entered the war . The Secretary of the Navy has submitted to your Committees for authorization that part of the programme which covers the building plans of the next three years . These plans have been prepared along the lines and in accordance with the policy which the Congress established , not under the exceptional conditions of the war , but with the intention of adhering to a definite method of development for the navy . I earnestly recommend the uninterrupted pursuit of that policy . It would clearly be unwise for us to attempt to adjust our programmes to a future world policy as yet undetermined . The question which causes me the greatest concern is the question of the policy to be adopted towards the railroads . I frankly turn to you for counsel upon it . I have no confident judgment of my own . I do not see how any thoughtful man can have who knows anything of the complexity of the problem . It is a problem which must be studied , studied immediately , and studied without bias or prejudice . Nothing can be gained by becoming partisans of any particular plan of settlement . It was necessary that the administration of the railways should be taken over by the Government so long as the war lasted . It would have been impossible otherwise to establish and carry through under a single direction the necessary priorities of shipment . It would have been impossible otherwise to combine maximum production at the factories and mines and farms with the maximum possible car supply to take the products to the ports and markets impossible to route troop shipments and freight shipments without regard to the advantage or disadvantage of the roads employed impossible to subordinate , when necessary , all questions of convenience to the public necessity impossible to give the necessary financial support to the roads from the public treasury . But all these necessities have now been served , and the question is , What is best for the railroads and for the public in the future Exceptional circumstances and exceptional methods of administration were not needed to convince us that the railroads were not equal to the immense tasks of transportation imposed upon them by the rapid and continuous development of the industries of the country . We knew that already . And we knew that they were unequal to it partly because their full cooperation was rendered impossible by law and their competition made obligatory , so that it has been impossible to assign to them severally the traffic which could best be carried by their respective lines in the interest of expedition and national economy . We may hope , I believe , for the formal conclusion of the war by treaty by the time Spring has come . The twentyone months to which the present control of the railways is limited after formal proclamation of peace shall have been made will run at the farthest , I take it for granted , only to the January of 1921 . The full equipment of the railways which the federal administration had planned could not be completed within any such period . The present law does not permit the use of the revenues of the several roads for the execution of such plans except by formal contract with their directors , some of whom will consent while some will not , and therefore does not afford sufficient authority to undertake improvements upon the scale upon which it would be necessary to undertake them . Every approach to this difficult subject matter of decision brings us face to face , therefore , with this unanswered question What is it right that we should do with the railroads , in the interest of the public and in fairness to their owners Let me say at once that I have no answer ready . The only thing that is perfectly clear to me is that it is not fair either to the public or to the owners of the railroads to leave the question unanswered and that it will presently become my duty to relinquish control of the roads , even before the expiration of the statutory period , unless there should appear some clear prospect in the meantime of a legislative solution . Their release would at least produce one element of a solution , namely certainty and a quick stimulation of private initiative . I believe that it will be serviceable for me to set forth as explicitly as possible the alternative courses that lie open to our choice . We can simply release the roads and go back to the old conditions of private management , unrestricted competition , and multiform regulation by both state and federal authorities or we can go to the opposite extreme and establish complete government control , accompanied , if necessary , by actual government ownership or we can adopt an intermediate course of modified private control , under a more unified and affirmative public regulation and under such alterations of the law as will permit wasteful competition to be avoided and a considerable degree of unification of administration to be effected , as , for example , by regional corporations under which the railways of definable areas would be in effect combined in single systems . The one conclusion that I am ready to state with confidence is that it would be a disservice alike to the country and to the owners of the railroads to return to the old conditions unmodified . Those are conditions of restraint without development . There is nothing affirmative or helpful about them . What the country chiefly needs is that all its means of transportation should be developed , its railways , its waterways , its highways , and its countryside roads . Some new element of policy , therefore , is absolutely necessary necessary for the service of the public , necessary for the release of credit to those who are administering the railways , necessary for the protection of their security holders . The old policy may be changed much or little , but surely it cannot wisely be left as it was . I hope that the Congress will have a complete and impartial study of the whole problem instituted at once and prosecuted as rapidly as possible . I stand ready and anxious to release the roads from the present control and I must do so at a very early date if by waiting until the statutory limit of time is reached I shall be merely prolonging the period of doubt and uncertainty which is hurtful to every interest concerned . I welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join in Paris the representatives of the governments with which we have been associated in the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of discussing with them the main features of the treaty of peace . I realize the great inconveniences that will attend my leaving the country , particularly at this time , but the conclusion that it was my paramount duty to go has been forced upon me by considerations which I hope will seem as conclusive to you as they have seemed to me . The Allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I outlined to the Congress on the eighth of January last , as the Central Empires also have , and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their interpretation and application , and it is highly desirable that I should give it in order that the sincere desire of our Government to contribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlements that will be of common benefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully manifest . The peace settlements which are now to be agreed upon are of transcendent importance both to us and to the rest of the world , and I know of no business or interest which should take precedence of them . The gallant men of our armed forces on land and sea have consciously fought for the ideals which they knew to be the ideals of their country I have sought to express those ideals they have accepted my statements of them as the substance of their own thought and purpose , as the associated governments have accepted them I owe it to them to see to it , so far as in me lies , that no false or mistaken interpretation is put upon them , and no possible effort omitted to realize them . It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life s blood to obtain . I can think of no call to service which could transcend this . I shall be in close touch with you and with affairs on this side the water , and you will know all that I do . At my request , the French and English governments have absolutely removed the censorship of cable news which until within a fortnight they had maintained and there is now no censorship whatever exercised at this end except upon attempted trade communications with enemy countries . It has been necessary to keep an open wire constantly available between Paris and the Department of State and another between France and the Department of War . In order that this might be done with the least possible interference with the other uses of the cables , I have temporarily taken over the control of both cables in order that they may be used as a single system . I did so at the advice of the most experienced cable officials , and I hope that the results will justify my hope that the news of the next few months may pass with the utmost freedom and with the least possible delay from each side of the sea to the other . May I not hope , Gentlemen of the Congress , that in the delicate tasks I shall have to perform on the other side of the sea , in my efforts truly and faithfully to interpret the principles and purposes of the country we love , I may have the encouragement and the added strength of your united support I realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty I am undertaking I am poignantly aware of its grave responsibilities . I am the servant of the nation . I can have no private thought or purpose of my own in performing such an errand . I go to give the best that is in me to the common settlements which I must now assist in arriving at in conference with the other working heads of the associated governments . I shall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement . I shall not be inaccessible . The cables and the wireless will render me available for any counsel or service you may desire of me , and I shall be happy in the thought that I am constantly in touch with the weighty matters of domestic policy with which we shall have to deal . I shall make my absence as brief as possible and shall hope to return with the happy assurance that it has been possible to translate into action the great ideals for which America has striven .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Senate On the eighteenth of December last I addressed an identic note to the governments of the nations now at war requesting them to state , more definitely than they had yet been stated by either group of belligerents , the terms upon which they would deem it possible to make peace . I spoke on behalf of humanity and of the rights of all neutral nations like our own , many of whose most vital interests the war puts in constant jeopardy . The Central Powers united in a reply which stated merely that they were ready to meet their antagonists in conference to discuss terms of peace . The Entente Powers have replied much more definitely and have stated , in general terms , indeed , but with sufficient definiteness to imply details , the arrangements , guarantees , and acts of reparation which they deem to be the indispensable conditions of a satisfactory settlement . We are that much nearer a definite discussion of the peace which shall end the present war . We are that much nearer the discussion of the international concert which must thereafter hold the world at peace . In every discussion of the peace that must end this war it is taken for granted that that peace must be followed by some definite concert of power which will make it virtually impossible that any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm us again . Every lover of mankind , every sane and thoughtful man must take that for granted . I have sought this opportunity to address you because I thought that I owed it to you , as the council associated with me in the final determination of our international obligations , to disclose to you without reserve the thought and purpose that have been taking form in my mind in regard to the duty of our Government in the days to come when it will be necessary to lay afresh and upon a new plan the foundations of peace among the nations . It is inconceivable that the people of the United States should play no part in that great enterprise . To take part in such a service will be the opportunity for which they have sought to prepare themselves by the very principles and purposes of their polity and the approved practices of their Government ever since the days when they set up a new nation in the high and honorable hope that it might in all that it was and did show mankind the way to liberty . They cannot in honor withhold the service to which they are now about to be challenged . They do not wish to withhold it . But they owe it to themselves and to the other nations of the world to state the conditions under which they will feel free to render it . That service is nothing less than this , to add their authority and their power to the authority and force of other nations to guarantee peace and justice throughout the world . Such a settlement cannot now be long postponed . It is right that before it comes this Government should frankly formulate the conditions upon which it would feel justified in asking our people to approve its formal and solemn adherence to a League for Peace . I am here to attempt to state those conditions . The present war must first be ended but we owe it to candor and to a just regard for the opinion of mankind to say that , so far as our participation in guarantees of future peace is concerned , it makes a great deal of difference in what way and upon what terms it is ended . The treaties and agreements which bring it to an end must embody terms which will create a peace that is worth guaranteeing and preserving , a peace that will win the approval of mankind , not merely a peace that will serve the several interests and immediate aims of the nations engaged . We shall have no voice in determining what those terms shall be , but we shall , I feel sure , have a voice in determining whether they shall be made lasting or not by the guarantees of a universal covenant and our judgment upon what is fundamental and essential as a condition precedent to permanency should be spoken now , not afterwards when it may be too late . No covenant of cooperative peace that does not include the peoples of the New World can suffice to keep the future safe against war and yet there is only one sort of peace that the peoples of America could join in guaranteeing . The elements of that peace must be elements that engage the confidence and satisfy the principles of the American governments , elements consistent with their political faith and with the practical convictions which the peoples of America have once for all embraced and undertaken to defend . I do not mean to say that any American government would throw any obstacle in the way of any terms of peace the governments now at war might agree upon , or seek to upset them when made , whatever they might be . I only take it for granted that mere terms of peace between the belligerents will not satisfy even the belligerents themselves . Mere agreements may not make peace secure . It will be absolutely necessary that a force be created as a guarantor of the permanency of the settlement so much greater than the force of any nation now engaged or any alliance hitherto formed or projected that no nation , no probable combination of nations could face or withstand it . If the peace presently to be made is to endure , it must be a peace made secure by the organized major force of mankind . The terms of the immediate peace agreed upon will determine whether it is a peace for which such a guarantee can be secured . The question upon which the whole future peace and policy of the world depends is this Is the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace , or only for a new balance of power If it be only a struggle for a new balance of power , who will guarantee , who can guarantee , the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement Only a tranquil Europe can be a stable Europe . There must be , not a balance of power , but a community of power not organized rivalries , but an organized common peace . Fortunately we have received very explicit assurances on this point . The statesmen of both of the groups of nations now arrayed against one another have said , in terms that could not be misinterpreted , that it was no part of the purpose they had in mind to crush their antagonists . But the implications of these assurances may not be equally clear to all may not be the same on both sides of the water . I think it will be serviceable if I attempt to set forth what we understand them to be . They imply , first of all , that it must be a peace without victory . It is not pleasant to say this . I beg that I may be permitted to put my own interpretation upon it and that it may be understood that no other interpretation was in my thought . I am seeking only to face realities and to face them without soft concealments . Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser , a victor s terms imposed upon the vanquished . It would be accepted in humiliation , under duress , at an intolerable sacrifice , and would leave a sting , a resentment , a bitter memory upon which terms of peace would rest , not permanently , but only as upon quicksand . Only a peace between equals can last . Only a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit . The right state of mind , the right feeling between nations , is as necessary for a lasting peace as is the just settlement of vexed questions of territory or of racial and national allegiance . The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded if it is to last must be an equality of rights the guarantees exchanged must neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations and small , between those that are powerful and those that are weak . Right must be based upon the common strength , not upon the individual strength , of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend . Equality of territory or of resources there of course cannot be nor any other sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the peoples themselves . But no one asks or expects anything more than an equality of rights . Mankind is looking now for freedom of life , not for equipoises of power . And there is a deeper thing involved than even equality of right among organized nations . No peace can last , or ought to last , which does not recognize and accept the principle that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed , and that no right anywhere exists to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property . I take it for granted , for instance , if I may venture upon a single example , that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united , independent , and autonomous Poland , and that henceforth inviolable security of life , of worship , and of industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own . I speak of this , not because of any desire to exalt an abstract political principle which has always been held very dear by those who have sought to build up liberty in America , but for the same reason that I have spoken of the other conditions of peace which seem to me clearly indispensable , because I wish frankly to uncover realities . Any peace which does not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be upset . It will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of mankind . The ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly and constantly against it , and all the world will sympathize . The world can be at peace only if its life is stable , and there can be no stability where the will is in rebellion , where there is not tranquillity of spirit and a sense of justice , of freedom , and of right . So far as practicable , moreover , every great people now struggling towards a full development of its resources and of its powers should be assured a direct outlet to the great highways of the sea . Where this cannot be done by the cession of territory , it can no doubt be done by the neutralization of direct rights of way under the general guarantee which will assure the peace itself . With a right comity of arrangement no nation need be shut away from free access to the open paths of the world s commerce . And the paths of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free . The freedom of the seas is the sine qua non of peace , equality , and cooperation . No doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the rules of international practice hitherto thought to be established may be necessary in order to make the seas indeed free and common in practically all circumstances for the use of mankind , but the motive for such changes is convincing and compelling . There can be no trust or intimacy between the peoples of the world without them . The free , constant , unthreatened intercourse of nations is an essential part of the process of peace and of development . It need not be difficult either to define or to secure the freedom of the seas if the governments of the world sincerely desire to come to an agreement concerning it . It is a problem closely connected with the limitation of naval armaments and the cooperation of the navies of the world in keeping the seas at once free and safe . And the question of limiting naval armaments opens the wider and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of armies and of all programs of military preparation . Difficult and delicate as these questions are , they must be faced with the utmost candor and decided in a spirit of real accommodation if peace is to come with healing in its wings , and come to stay . Peace cannot be had without concession and sacrifice . There can be no sense of safety and equality among the nations if great preponderating armaments are henceforth to continue here and there to be built up and maintained . The statesmen of the world must plan for peace and nations must adjust and accommodate their policy to it as they have planned for war and made ready for pitiless contest and rivalry . The question of armaments , whether on land or sea , is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind . I have spoken upon these great matters without reserve and with the utmost explicitness because it has seemed to me to be necessary if the world s yearning desire for peace was anywhere to find free voice and utterance . Perhaps I am the only person in high authority amongst all the peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing back . I am speaking as an individual , and yet I am speaking also , of course , as the responsible head of a great government , and I feel confident that I have said what the people of the United States would wish me to say . May I not add that I hope and believe that I am in effect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and of every program of liberty I would fain believe that I am speaking for the silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin they see to have come already upon the persons and the homes they hold most dear . And in holding out the expectation that the people and Government of the United States will join the other civilized nations of the world in guaranteeing the permanence of peace upon such terms as I have named I speak with the greater boldness and confidence because it is clear to every man who can think that there is in this promise no breach in either our traditions or our policy as a nation , but a fulfilment , rather , of all that we have professed or striven for . I am proposing , as it were , that the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of the world that no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or people , but that every people should be left free to determine its own polity , its own way of development , unhindered , unthreatened , unafraid , the little along with the great and powerful . I am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances which would draw them into competitions of power , catch them in a net of intrigue and selfish rivalry , and disturb their own affairs with influences intruded from without . There is no entangling alliance in a concert of power . When all unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose all act in the common interest and are free to live their own lives under a common protection . I am proposing government by the consent of the governed that freedom of the seas which in international conference after conference representatives of the United States have urged with the eloquence of those who are the convinced disciples of liberty and that moderation of armaments which makes of armies and navies a power for order merely , not an instrument of aggression or of selfish violence . These are American principles , American policies . We could stand for no others . And they are also the principles and policies of forward looking men and women everywhere , of every modern nation , of every enlightened community . They are the principles of mankind and must prevail .<speech_sep>My Fellow Countrymen The entrance of our own beloved country into the grim and terrible war for democracy and human rights which has shaken the world creates so many problems of national life and action which call for immediate consideration and settlement that I hope you will permit me to address to you a few words of earnest counsel and appeal with regard to them . We are rapidly putting our navy upon an effective war footing and are about to create and equip a great army , but these are the simplest parts of the great task to which we have addressed ourselves . There is not a single selfish element , so far as I can see , in the cause we are fighting for . We are fighting for what we believe and wish to be the rights of mankind and for the future peace and security of the world . To do this great thing worthily and successfully we must devote ourselves to the service without regard to profit or material advantage and with an energy and intelligence that will rise to the level of the enterprise itself . We must realize to the full how great the task is and how many things , how many kinds and elements of capacity and service and self sacrifice , it involves . These , then , are the things we must do , and do well , besides fighting , the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our seamen not only , but also for a large part of the nations with whom we have now made common cause , in whose support and by whose sides we shall be fighting . We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to the other side of the sea , submarines or no submarines , what will every day be needed there , and abundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories with which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea but also to clothe and support our people for whom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer work , to help clothe and equip the armies with which we are coordinating in Europe , and to keep the looms and manufactories there in raw material coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here and there rails for worn out railways back of the fighting fronts locomotives and rolling stock to take the place of those every day going to pieces mules , horses , cattle for labor and for military service everything with which the people of England and France and Italy and Russia have usually supplied themselves but cannot now afford the men , the materials , or the machinery to make . It is evident to every thinking man that our industries , on the farms , in the shipyards , in the mines , in the factories , must be made more prolific and more efficient than ever and that they must be more economically managed and better adapted to the particular requirements of our task than they have been and what I want to say is that the men and the women who devote their thought and their energy to these things will be serving the country and conducting the fight for peace and freedom just as truly and just as effectively as the men on the battlefield or in the trenches . The industrial forces of the country , men and women alike , will be a great national , a great international , Service Army , a notable and honored host engaged in the service of the nation and the world , the efficient friends and saviors of free men everywhere . Thousands , nay , hundreds of thousands , of men otherwise liable to military service will of right and of necessity be excused from that service and assigned to the fundamental , sustaining work of the fields and factories and mines , and they will be as much part of the great patriotic forces of the nation as the men under fire . I take the liberty , therefore , of addressing this word to the farmers of the country and to all who work on the farms The supreme need of our own nation and of the nations with which we are coordinating is an abundance of supplies , and especially of food stuffs . The importance of an adequate food supply , especially for the present year , is superlative . Without abundant food , alike for the armies and the peoples now at war , the whole great enterprise upon which we have embarked will break down and fail . The world s food reserves are low . Not only during the present emergency but for some time after peace shall have come both our own people and a large proportion of the people of Europe must rely upon the harvests in America . Upon the farmers of this country , therefore , in large measure , rests the fate of the war and the fate of the nations . May the nation not count upon them to omit no step that will increase the production of their land or that will bring about the most effectual coordination in the sale and distribution of their products The time is short . It is of the most imperative importance that everything possible be done and done immediately to make sure of large harvests . I call upon young men and old alike and upon the able bodied boys of the land to accept and act upon this duty to turn in hosts to the farms and make certain that no pains and no labor is lacking in this great matter . I particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant food stuffs as well as cotton . They can show their patriotism in no better or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of the present price of cotton and helping , helping upon a great scale , to feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their liberties and for our own . The variety of their crops will be the visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty . The Government of the United States and the governments of the several States stand ready to coordinate . They will do everything possible to assist farmers in securing an adequate supply of seed , an adequate force of laborers when they are most needed , at harvest time , and the means of expediting shipments of fertilizers and farm machinery , as well as of the crops themselves when harvested . The course of trade shall be as unhampered as it is possible to make it and there shall be no unwarranted manipulation of the nation s food supply by those who handle it on its way to the consumer . This is our opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency of a great Democracy and we shall not fall short of it This let me say to the middlemen of every sort , whether they are handling our food stuffs or our raw materials of manufacture or the products of our mills and factories The eyes of the country will be especially upon you . This is your opportunity for signal service , efficient and disinterested . The country expects you , as it expects all others , to forego unusual profits , to organize and expedite shipments of supplies of every kind , but especially of food , with an eye to the service you are rendering and in the spirit of those who enlist in the ranks , for their people , not for themselves . I shall confidently expect you to deserve and win the confidence of people of every sort and station . To the men who run the railways of the country , whether they be managers or operative employees , let me say that the railways are the arteries of the nation s life and that upon them rests the immense responsibility of seeing to it that those arteries suffer no obstruction of any kind , no inefficiency or slackened power . To the merchant let me suggest the motto , Small profits and quick service and to the shipbuilder the thought that the life of the war depends upon him . The food and the war supplies must be carried across the seas no matter how many ships are sent to the bottom . The places of those that go down must be supplied and supplied at once . To the miner let me say that he stands where the farmer does the work of the world waits on him . If he slackens or fails , armies and statesmen are helpless . He also is enlisted in the great Service Army . The manufacturer does not need to be told , I hope , that the nation looks to him to speed and perfect every process and I want only to remind his employees that their service is absolutely indispensable and is counted on by every man who loves the country and its liberties . Let me suggest , also , that everyone who creates or cultivates a garden helps , and helps greatly , to solve the problem of the feeding of the nations and that every housewife who practices strict economy puts herself in the ranks of those who serve the nation . This is the time for America to correct her unpardonable fault of wastefulness and extravagance . Let every man and every woman assume the duty of careful , provident use and expenditure as a public duty , as a dictate of patriotism which no one can now expect ever to be excused or forgiven for ignoring . In the hope that this statement of the needs of the nation and of the world in this hour of supreme crisis may stimulate those to whom it comes and remind all who need reminder of the solemn duties of a time such as the world has never seen before , I beg that all editors and publishers everywhere will give as prominent publication and as wide circulation as possible to this appeal . I venture to suggest , also , to all advertising agencies that they would perhaps render a very substantial and timely service to the country if they would give it widespread repetition . And I hope that clergymen will not think the theme of it an unworthy or inappropriate subject of comment and homily from their pulpits . The supreme test of the nation has come . We must all speak , act , and serve together<speech_sep>Senator James , Gentlemen of the Notification Committee , Fellow Citizens I cannot accept the leadership and responsibility which the National Democratic Convention has again , in such generous fashion , asked me to accept without first expressing my profound gratitude to the party for the trust it reposes in me after four years of fiery trial in the midst of affairs of unprecedented difficulty , and the keen sense of added responsibility with which this honor fills I had almost said burdens me as I think of the great issues of national life and policy involved in the present and immediate future conduct of our Government . I shall seek , as I have always sought , to justify the extraordinary confidence thus reposed in me by striving to purge my heart and purpose of every personal and of every misleading party motive and devoting every energy I have to the service of the nation as a whole , praying that I may continue to have the counsel and support of all forward looking men at every turn of the difficult business . For I do not doubt that the people of the United States will wish the Democratic Party to continue in control of the Government . They are not in the habit of rejecting those who have actually served them for those who are making doubtful and conjectural promises of service . Least of all are they likely to substitute those who promised to render them particular services and proved false to that promise for those who have actually rendered those very services . Boasting is always an empty business , which pleases nobody but the boaster , and I have no disposition to boast of what the Democratic Party has accomplished . It has merely done its duty . It has merely fulfilled its explicit promises . But there can be no violation of good taste in calling attention to the manner in which those promises have been carried out or in adverting to the interesting fact that many of the things accomplished were what the opposition party had again and again promised to do but had left undone . Indeed that is manifestly part of the business of this year of reckoning and assessment . There is no means of judging the future except by assessing the past . Constructive action must be weighed against destructive comment and reaction . The Democrats either have or have not understood the varied interests of the country . The test is contained in the record . What is that record What were the Democrats called into power to do What things had long waited to be done , and how did the Democrats do them It is a record of extraordinary length and variety , rich in elements of many kinds , but consistent in principle throughout and susceptible of brief recital . The Republican Party was put out of power because of failure , practical failure and moral failure because it had served special interests and not the country at large because , under the leadership of its preferred and established guides , of those who still make its choices , it had lost touch with the thoughts and the needs of the nation and was living in a past age and under a fixed illusion , the illusion of greatness . It had framed tariff laws based upon a fear of foreign trade , a fundamental doubt as to American skill , enterprise , and capacity , and a very tender regard for the profitable privileges of those who had gained control of domestic markets and domestic credits and yet had enacted anti trust laws which hampered the very things they meant to foster , which were stiff and inelastic , and in part unintelligible . It had permitted the country throughout the long period of its control to stagger from one financial crisis to another under the operation of a national banking law of its own framing which made stringency and panic certain and the control of the larger business operations of the country by the bankers of a few reserve centers inevitable had made as if it meant to reform the law but had faint heartedly failed in the attempt , because it could not bring itself to do the one thing necessary to make the reform genuine and effectual , namely , break up the control of small groups of bankers . It had been oblivious , or indifferent , to the fact that the farmers , upon whom the country depends for its food and in the last analysis for its prosperity , were without standing in the matter of commercial credit , without the protection of standards in their market transactions , and without systematic knowledge of the markets themselves that the laborers of the country , the great army of men who man the industries it was professing to father and promote , carried their labor as a mere commodity to market , were subject to restraint by novel and drastic process in the courts , were without assurance of compensation for industrial accidents , without federal assistance in accommodating labor disputes , and without national aid or advice in finding the places and the industries in which their labor was most needed . The country had no national system of road construction and development . Little intelligent attention was paid to the army , and not enough to the navy . The other republics of America distrusted us , because they found that we thought first of the profits of American investors and only as an afterthought of impartial justice and helpful friendship . Its policy was provincial in all things its purposes were out of harmony with the temper and purpose of the people and the timely development of the nation s interests . So things stood when the Democratic Party came into power . How do they stand now Alike in the domestic field and in the wide field of the commerce of the world , American business and life and industry have been set free to move as they never moved before . The tariff has been revised , not on the principle of repelling foreign trade , but upon the principle of encouraging it , upon something like a footing of equality with our own in respect of the terms of competition , and a Tariff Board has been created whose function it will be to keep the relations of American with foreign business and industry under constant observation , for the guidance alike of our business men and of our Congress . American energies are now directed towards the markets of the world . The laws against trusts have been clarified by definition , with a view to making it plain that they were not directed against big business but only against unfair business and the pretense of competition where there was none and a Trade Commission has been created with powers of guidance and accommodation which have relieved business men of unfounded fears and set them upon the road of hopeful and confident enterprise . By the Federal Reserve Act the supply of currency at the disposal of active business has been rendered elastic , taking its volume , not from a fixed body of investment securities , but from the liquid assets of daily trade and these assets are assessed and accepted , not by distant groups of bankers in control of unavailable reserves , but by bankers at the many centers of local exchange who are in touch with local conditions everywhere . Effective measures have been taken for the re creation of an American merchant marine and the revival of the American carrying trade indispensable to our emancipation from the control which foreigners have so long exercised over the opportunities , the routes , and the methods of our commerce with other countries . The Interstate Commerce Commission is about to be reorganized to enable it to perform its great and important functions more promptly and more efficiently . We have created , extended and improved the service of the parcels post . So much we have done for business . What other party has understood the task so well or executed it so intelligently and energetically What other party has attempted it at all The Republican leaders , apparently , know of no means of assisting business but protection . How to stimulate it and put it upon a new footing of energy and enterprise they have not suggested . For the farmers of the country we have virtually created commercial credit , by means of the Federal Reserve Act and the Rural Credits Act . They now have the standing of other business men in the money market . We have successfully regulated speculation in futures and established standards in the marketing of grains . By an intelligent Warehouse Act we have assisted to make the standard crops available as never before both for systematic marketing and as a security for loans from the banks . We have greatly added to the work of neighborhood demonstration on the farm itself of improved methods of cultivation , and , through the intelligent extension of the functions of the Department of Agriculture , have made it possible for the farmer to learn systematically where his best markets are and how to get at them . The workingmen of America have been given a veritable emancipation , by the legal recognition of a man s labor as part of his life , and not a mere marketable commodity by exempting labor organizations from processes of the courts which treated their members like fractional parts of mobs and not like accessible and responsible individuals by releasing our seamen from involuntary servitude by making adequate provision for compensation for industrial accidents by providing suitable machinery for mediation and conciliation in industrial disputes and by putting the Federal Department of Labor at the disposal of the workingman when in search of work . We have effected the emancipation of the children of the country by releasing them from hurtful labor . We have instituted a system of national aid in the building of highroads such as the country has been feeling after for a century . We have sought to equalize taxation by means of an equitable income tax . We have taken the steps that ought to have been taken at the outset to open up the resources of Alaska . We have provided for national defense upon a scale never before seriously proposed upon the responsibility of an entire political party . We have driven the tariff lobby from cover and obliged it to substitute solid argument for private influence . This extraordinary recital must sound like a platform , a list of sanguine promises but it is not . It is a record of promises made four years ago and now actually redeemed in constructive legislation . These things must profoundly disturb the thoughts and confound the plans of those who have made themselves believe that the Democratic Party neither understood nor was ready to assist the business of the country in the great enterprises which it is its evident and inevitable destiny to undertake and carry through . The breaking up of the lobby must especially disconcert them for it was through the lobby that they sought and were sure they had found the heart of things . The game of privilege can be played successfully by no other means . This record must equally astonish those who feared that the Democratic Party had not opened its heart to comprehend the demands of social justice . We have in four years come very near to carrying out the platform of the Progressive Party as well as our own for we also are progressives . There is one circumstance connected with this program which ought to be very plainly stated . It was resisted at every step by the interests which the Republican Party had catered to and fostered at the expense of the country , and these same interests are now earnestly praying for a reaction which will save their privileges , for the restoration of their sworn friends to power before it is too late to recover what they have lost . They fought with particular desperation and infinite resourcefulness the reform of the banking and currency system , knowing that to be the citadel of their control and most anxiously are they hoping and planning for the amendment of the Federal Reserve Act by the concentration of control in a single bank which the old familiar group of bankers can keep under their eye and direction . But while the big men who used to write the tariffs and command the assistance of the Treasury have been hostile , all but a few with vision , the average business man knows that he has been delivered , and that the fear that was once every day in his heart , that the men who controlled credit and directed enterprise from the committee rooms of Congress would crush him , is there no more , and will not return , unless the party that consulted only the big men should return to power , the party of masterly inactivity and cunning resourcefulness in standing pat to resist change . The Republican Party is just the party that cannot meet the new conditions of a new age . It does not know the way and it does not wish new conditions . It tried to break away from the old leaders and could not . They still select its candidates and dictate its policy , still resist change , still hanker after the old conditions , still know no methods of encouraging business but the old methods . When it changes its leaders and its purposes and brings its ideas up to date it will have the right to ask the American people to give it power again but not until then . A new age , an age of revolutionary change , needs new purposes and new ideas . In foreign affairs we have been guided by principles clearly conceived and consistently lived up to . Perhaps they have not been fully comprehended because they have hitherto governed international affairs only in theory , not in practice . They are simple , obvious , easily stated , and fundamental to American ideals . We have been neutral not only because it was the fixed and traditional policy of the United States to stand aloof from the politics of Europe and because we had had no part either of action or of policy in the influences which brought on the present war , but also because it was manifestly our duty to prevent , if it were possible , the indefinite extension of the fires of hate and desolation kindled by that terrible conflict and seek to serve mankind by reserving cur strength and our resources for the anxious and difficult days of restoration and healing which must follow , when peace will have to build its house anew . The rights of our own citizens of course became involved that was inevitable . Where they did this was our guiding principle that property rights can be vindicated by claims for damages and no modern nation can decline to arbitrate such claims but the fundamental rights of humanity cannot be . The loss of life is irreparable . Neither can direct violations of a nation s sovereignty await vindication in suits for damages . The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance . It at once makes the quarrel in part our own . These are plain principles and we have never lost sight of them or departed from them , whatever the stress or the perplexity of circumstance or the provocation to hasty resentment . The record is clear and consistent throughout and stands distinct and definite for anyone to judge who wishes to know the truth about it . The seas were not broad enough to keep the infection of the conflict out of our own politics . The passions and intrigues of certain active groups and combinations of men amongst us who were born under foreign flags injected the poison of disloyalty into our own most critical affairs , laid violent hands upon many of our industries , and subjected us to the shame of divisions of sentiment and purpose in which America was contemned and forgotten . It is part of the business of this year of reckoning and settlement to speak plainly and act with unmistakable purpose in rebuke of these things , in order that they may be forever hereafter impossible . I am the candidate of a party , but I am above all things else an American citizen . I neither seek the favor nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element amongst us which puts loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the United States . While Europe was at war our own continent , one of our own neighbors , was shaken by revolution . In that matter , too , principle was plain and it was imperative that we should live up to it if we were to deserve the trust of any real partisan of the right as free men see it . We have professed to believe , and we do believe , that the people of small and weak states have the right to expect to be dealt with exactly as the people of big and powerful states would be . We have acted upon that principle in dealing with the people of Mexico . Our recent pursuit of bandits into Mexican territory was no violation of that principle . We ventured to enter Mexican territory only because there were no military forces in Mexico that could protect our border from hostile attack and our own people from violence , and we have committed there no single act of hostility or interference even with the sovereign authority of the Republic of Mexico herself . It was a plain case of the violation of our own sovereignty which could not wait to be vindicated by damages and for which there was no other remedy . The authorities of Mexico were powerless to prevent it . Many serious wrongs against the property , many irreparable wrongs against the persons of Americans have been committed within the territory of Mexico herself during this confused revolution , wrongs which could not be effectually checked so long as there was no constituted power in Mexico which was in a position to check them . We could not act directly in that matter ourselves without denying Mexicans the right to any revolution at all which disturbed us and making the emancipation of her own people await our own interest and convenience . For it is their emancipation that they are seeking , blindly , it may be , and as yet ineffectually , but with profound and passionate purpose and within their unquestionable right , apply what true American principle you will , any principle that an American would publicly avow . The people of Mexico have not been suffered to own their own country or direct their own institutions . Outsiders , men out of other nations and with interests too often alien to their own , have dictated what their privileges and opportunities should be and who should control their land , their lives , and their resources , some of them Americans , pressing for things they could never have got in their own country . The Mexican people are entitled to attempt their liberty from such influences and so long as I have anything to do with the action of our great Government I shall do everything in my power to prevent anyone standing in their way . I know that this is hard for some persons to understand but it is not hard for the plain people of the United States to understand . It is hard doctrine only for those who wish to get something for themselves out of Mexico . There are men , and noble women , too , not a few , of our own people , thank God whose fortunes are invested in great properties in Mexico who yet see the case with true vision and assess its issues with true American feeling . The rest can be left for the present out of the reckoning until this enslaved people has had its day of struggle towards the light . I have heard no one who was free from such influences propose interference by the United States with the internal affairs of Mexico . Certainly no friend of the Mexican people has proposed it . The people of the United States are capable of great sympathies and a noble pity in dealing with problems of this kind . As their spokesman and representative , I have tried to act in the spirit they would wish me show . The people of Mexico are striving for the rights that are fundamental to life and happiness , 15 , 000 , 000 oppressed men , overburdened women , and pitiful children in virtual bondage in their own home of fertile lands and inexhaustible treasure Some of the leaders of the revolution may often have been mistaken and violent and selfish , but the revolution itself was inevitable and is right . The unspeakable Huerta betrayed the very comrades he served , traitorously overthrew the government of which he was a trusted part , impudently spoke for the very forces that had driven his people to the rebellion with which he had pretended to sympathize . The men who overcame him and drove him out represent at least the fierce passion of reconstruction which lies at the very heart of liberty and so long as they represent , however imperfectly , such a struggle for deliverance , I am ready to serve their ends when I can . So long as the power of recognition rests with me the Government of the United States will refuse to extend the hand of welcome to any one who obtains power in a sister republic by treachery and violence . No permanency can be given the affairs of any republic by a title based upon intrigue and assassination . I declared that to be the policy of this Administration within three weeks after I assumed the presidency . I here again vow it . I am more interested in the fortunes of oppressed men and pitiful women and children than in any property rights whatever . Mistakes I have no doubt made in this perplexing business , but not in purpose or object . More is involved than the immediate destinies of Mexico and the relations of the United States with a distressed and distracted people . All America looks on . Test is now being made of us whether we be sincere lovers of popular liberty or not and are indeed to be trusted to respect national sovereignty among our weaker neighbors . We have undertaken these many years to play big brother to the republics of this hemisphere . This is the day of our test whether we mean , or have ever meant , to play that part for our own benefit wholly or also for theirs . Upon the outcome of that test its outcome in their minds , not in ours depends every relationship of the United States with Latin America , whether in politics or in commerce and enterprise . These are great issues and lie at the heart of the gravest tasks of the future , tasks both economic and political and very intimately inwrought with many of the most vital of the new issues of the politics of the world . The republics of America have in the last three years been drawing together in a new spirit of accommodation , mutual understanding , and cordial cooperation . Much of the politics of the world in the years to come will depend upon their relationships with one another . It is a barren and provincial statesmanship that loses sight of such things The future , the immediate future , will bring us squarely face to face with many great and exacting problems which will search us through and through whether we be able and ready to play the part in the world that we mean to play . It will not bring us into their presence slowly , gently , with ceremonious introduction , but suddenly and at once , the moment the war in Europe is over . They will be new problems , most of them many will be old problems in a new setting and with new elements which we have never dealt with or reckoned the force and meaning of before . They will require for their solution new thinking , fresh courage and resourcefulness , and in some matters radical reconsiderations of policy . We must be ready to mobilize our resources alike of brains and of materials . It is not a future to be afraid of . It is , rather , a future to stimulate and excite us to the display of the best powers that are in us . We may enter it with confidence when we are sure that we understand it , and we have provided ourselves already with the means of understanding it . Look first at what it will be necessary that the nations of the world should do to make the days to come tolerable and fit to live and work in and then look at our part in what is to follow and our own duty of preparation . For we must be prepared both in resources and in policy . There must be a just and settled peace , and we here in America must contribute the full force of our enthusiasm and of our authority as a nation to the organization of that peace upon world wide foundations that cannot easily be shaken . No nation should be forced to take sides in any quarrel in which its own honor and integrity and the fortunes of its own people are not involved but no nation can any longer remain neutral as against any wilful disturbance of the peace of the world . The effects of war can no longer be confined to the areas of battle . No nation stands wholly apart in interest when the life and interests of all nations are thrown into confusion and peril . If hopeful and generous enterprise is to be renewed , if the healing and helpful arts of life are indeed to be revived when peace comes again , a new atmosphere of justice and friendship must be generated by means the world has never tried before . The nations of the world must unite in joint guarantees that whatever is done to disturb the whole world s life must first be tested in the court of the whole world s opinion before it is attempted . These are the new foundations the world must build for itself , and we must play our part in the reconstruction , generously and without too much thought of our separate interests . We must make ourselves ready to play it intelligently , vigorously , and well . One of the contributions we must make to the world s peace is this We must see to it that the people in our insular possessions are treated in their own lands as we would treat them here , and make the rule of the United States mean the same thing everywhere , the same justice , the same consideration for the essential rights of men . Besides contributing our ungrudging moral and practical support to the establishment of peace throughout the world we must actively and intelligently prepare ourselves to do our full service in the trade and industry which are to sustain and develop the life of the nations in the days to come . We have already been provident in this great matter and supplied ourselves with the instrumentalities of prompt adjustment . We have created , in the Federal Trade Commission , a means of inquiry and of accommodation in the field of commerce which ought both to coordinate the enterprises of our traders and manufacturers and to remove the barriers of misunderstanding and of a too technical interpretation of the law . In the new Tariff Commission we have added another instrumentality of observation and adjustment which promises to be immediately serviceable . The Trade Commission substitutes counsel and accommodation for the harsher processes of legal restraint , and the Tariff Commission ought to substitute facts for prejudices and theories . Our exporters have for some time had the advantage of working in the new light thrown upon foreign markets and opportunities of trade by the intelligent inquiries and activities of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce which the Democratic Congress so wisely created in 1912 . The Tariff Commission completes the machinery by which we shall be enabled to open up our legislative policy to the facts as they develop . We can no longer indulge our traditional provincialism . We are to play a leading part in the world drama whether we wish it or not . We shall lend , not borrow act for ourselves , not imitate or follow organize and initiate , not peep about merely to see where we may get in . We have already formulated and agreed upon a policy of law which will explicitly remove the ban now supposed to rest upon cooperation amongst our exporters in seeking and securing their proper place in the markets of the world . The field will be free , the instrumentalities at hand . It will only remain for the masters of enterprise amongst us to act in energetic concert , and for the Government of the United States to insist upon the maintenance throughout the world of those conditions of fairness and of even handed justice in the commercial dealings of the nations with one another upon which , after all , in the last analysis , the peace and ordered life of the world must ultimately depend . At home also we must see to it that the men who plan and develop and direct our business enterprises shall enjoy definite and settled conditions of law , a policy accommodated to the freest progress . We have set the just and necessary limits . We have put all kinds of unfair competition under the ban and penalty of the law . We have barred monopoly . These fatal and ugly things being excluded , we must now quicken action and facilitate enterprise by every just means within our choice . There will be peace in the business world , and , with peace , revived confidence and life . We ought both to husband and to develop our natural resources , our mines , our forests , our water power . I wish we could have made more progress than we have made in this vital matter and I call once more , with the deepest earnestness and solicitude , upon the advocates of a careful and provident conservation , on the one hand , and the advocates of a free and inviting field for private capital , on the other , to get together in a spirit of genuine accommodation and agreement and set this great policy forward at once . We must hearten and quicken the spirit and efficiency of labor throughout our whole industrial system by everywhere and in all occupations doing justice to the laborer , not only by paying a living wage but also by making all the conditions that surround labor what they ought to be . And we must do more than justice . We must safeguard life and promote health and safety in every occupation in which they are threatened or imperilled . That is more than justice , and better , because it is humanity and economy . We must coordinate the railway systems of the country for national use , and must facilitate and promote their development with a view to that coordination and to their better adaptation as a whole to the life and trade and defense of the nation . The life and industry of the country can be free and unhampered only if these arteries are open , efficient , and complete . Thus shall we stand ready to meet the future as circumstance and international policy effect their unfolding , whether the changes come slowly or come fast and without preface . I have not spoken explicitly , Gentlemen , of the platform adopted at Louis but it has been implicit in all that I have said . I have sought to interpret its spirit and meaning . The people of the United States do not need to be assured now that that platform is a definite pledge , a practical program . We have proved to them that our promises are made to be kept . We hold very definite ideals . We believe that the energy and initiative of our people have been too narrowly coached and superintended that they should be set free , as we have set them free , to disperse themselves throughout the nation that they should not be concentrated in the hands of a few powerful guides and guardians , as our opponents have again and again , in effect if not in purpose , sought to concentrate them . We believe , moreover , who that looks about him now with comprehending eye can fail to believe that the day of Little Americanism , with its narrow horizons , when methods of protection and industrial nursing were the chief study of our provincial statesmen , are past and gone and that a day of enterprise has at last dawned for the United States whose field is the wide world . We hope to see the stimulus of that new day draw all America , the republics of both continents , on to a new life and energy and initiative in the great affairs of peace . We are Americans for Big America , and rejoice to look forward to the days in which America shall strive to stir the world without irritating it or drawing it on to new antagonisms , when the nations with which we deal shall at last come to see upon what deep foundations of humanity and justice our passion for peace rests , and when all mankind shall look upon our great people with a new sentiment of admiration , friendly rivalry and real affection , as upon a people who , though keen to succeed , seeks always to be at once generous and just and to whom humanity is dearer than profit or selfish power . Upon this record and in the faith of this purpose we go to the country .<speech_sep>Whereas the Congress of the United States in the exercise of the constitutional authority vested in them have resolved , by joint resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives bearing date this day That the state of war between the United States and the Imperial German Government which has been thrust upon the United States is hereby formally declared Whereas it is provided by Section 4067 of the Revised Statutes , as follows Whenever there is declared a war between the United States and any foreign nation or government , or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated , attempted , or threatened against the territory of the United States , by any foreign nation or government , and the President makes public proclamation of the event , all natives , citizens , denizens , or subjects of a hostile nation or government , being males of the age of fourteen years and upwards , who shall be within the United States , and not actually naturalized , shall be liable to be apprehended , restrained , secured , and removed as alien enemies .
