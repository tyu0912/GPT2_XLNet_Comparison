Chairman and Fellow Citizens We are assembled to celebrate the one hundred and thirty eighth anniversary of the birth of the United States . I suppose that we can more vividly realize the circumstances of that birth standing on this historic spot than it would be possible to realize them anywhere else . The Declaration of Independence was written in Philadelphia it was adopted in this historic building by which we stand . I have just had the privilege of sitting in the chair of the great man who presided over the deliberations of those who gave the declaration to the world . My hand rests at this moment upon the table upon which the declaration was signed . We can feel that we are almost in the visible and tangible presence of a great historic transaction . Have you ever read the Declaration of Independence or attended with close comprehension to the real character of it when you have heard it read If you have , you will know that it is not a Fourth of July oration . The Declaration of Independence was a document preliminary to war . It was a vital piece of practical business , not a piece of rhetoric and if you will pass beyond those preliminary passages which we are accustomed to quote about the rights of men and read into the heart of the document you will see that it is very express and detailed , that it consists of a series of definite specifications concerning actual public business of the day . Not the business of our day , for the matter with which it deals is past , but the business of that first revolution by which the Nation was set up , the business of 1776 . Its general statements , its general declarations cannot mean anything to us unless we append to it a similar specific body of particulars as to what we consider the essential business of our own day . Liberty does not consist , my fellow citizens , in mere general declarations of the rights of man . It consists in the translation of those declarations into definite action . Therefore , standing here where the declaration was adopted , reading its businesslike sentences , we ought to ask ourselves what there is in it for us . There is nothing in it for us unless we can translate it into the terms of our own conditions and of our own lives . We must reduce it to what the lawyers call a bill of particulars . It contains a bill of particulars , but the bill of particulars of 1776 . If we would keep it alive , we must fill it with a bill of particulars of the year 1914 . The task to which we have constantly to readdress ourselves is the task of proving that we are worthy of the men who drew this great declaration and know what they would have done in our circumstances . Patriotism consists in some very practical things practical in that they belong to the life of every day , that they wear no extraordinary distinction about them , that they are connected with commonplace duty . The way to be patriotic in America is not only to love America but to love the duty that lies nearest to our hand and know that in performing it we are serving our country . There are some gentlemen in Washington , for example , at this very moment who are showing themselves very patriotic in a way which does not attract wide attention but seems to belong to mere everyday obligations . The Members of the House and Senate who stay in hot Washington to maintain a quorum of the Houses and transact the all important business of the Nation are doing an act of patriotism . I honor them for it , and I am glad to stay there and stick by them until the work is done . It is patriotic , also , to learn what the facts of our national life are and to face them with candor . I have heard a great many facts stated about the present business condition of this country , for example a great many allegations of fact , at any rate , but the allegations do not tally with one another . And yet I know that truth always matches with truth and when I find some insisting that everything is going wrong and others insisting that everything is going right , and when I know from a wide observation of the general circumstances of the country taken as a whole that things are going extremely well , I wonder what those who are crying out that things are wrong are trying to do . Are they trying to serve the country , or are they trying to serve something smaller than the country Are they trying to put hope into the hearts of the men who work and toil every day , or are they trying to plant discouragement and despair in those hearts And why do they cry that everything is wrong and yet do nothing to set it right If they love America and anything is wrong amongst us , it is their business to put their hand with ours to the task of setting it right . When the facts are known and acknowledged , the duty of all patriotic men is to accept them in candor and to address themselves hopefully and confidently to the common counsel which is necessary to act upon them wisely and in universal concert . I have had some experiences in the last fourteen months which have not been entirely reassuring . It was universally admitted , for example , my fellow citizens , that the banking system of this country needed reorganization . We set the best minds that we could find to the task of discovering the best method of reorganization . But we met with hardly anything but criticism from the bankers of the country we met with hardly anything but resistance from the majority of those at least who spoke at all concerning the matter . And yet so soon as that act was passed there was a universal chorus of applause , and the very men who had opposed the measure joined in that applause . If it was wrong the day before it was passed , why was it right the day after it was passed Where had been the candor of criticism not only , but the concert of counsel which makes legislative action vigorous and safe and successful It is not patriotic to concert measures against one another it is patriotic to concert measures for one another . In one sense the Declaration of Independence has lost its significance . It has lost its significance as a declaration of national independence . Nobody outside of America believed when it was uttered that we could make good our independence now nobody anywhere would dare to doubt that we are independent and can maintain our independence . As a declaration of independence , therefore , it is a mere historic document . Our independence is a fact so stupendous that it can be measured only by the size and energy and variety and wealth and power of one of the greatest nations in the world . But it is one thing to be independent and it is another thing to know what to do with your independence . It is one thing to come to your majority and another thing to know what you are going to do with your life and your energies and one of the most serious questions for sober minded men to address themselves to in the United States is this What are we going to do with the influence and power of this great Nation Are we going to play the old role of using that power for our aggrandizement and material benefit only You know what that may mean . It may upon occasion mean that we shall use it to make the peoples of other nations suffer in the way in which we said it was intolerable to suffer when we uttered our Declaration of Independence . The Department of State at Washington is constantly called upon to back up the commercial enterprises and the industrial enterprises of the United States in foreign countries , and it at one time went so far in that direction that all its diplomacy came to be designated as dollar diplomacy . It was called upon to support every man who wanted to earn anything anywhere if he was an American . But there ought to be a limit to that . There is no man who is more interested than I am in carrying the enterprise of American business men to every quarter of the globe . I was interested in it long before I was suspected of being a politician . I have been preaching it year after year as the great thing that lay in the future for the United States , to show her wit and skill and enterprise and influence in every country in the world . But observe the limit to all that which is laid upon us perhaps more than upon any other nation in the world . We set this Nation up , at any rate we professed to set it up , to vindicate the rights of men . We did not name any differences between one race and another . We did not set up any barriers against any particular people . We opened our gates to all the world and said , Let all men who wish to be free come to us and they will be welcome . We said , This independence of ours is not a selfish thing for our own exclusive private use . It is for everybody to whom we can find the means of extending it . We cannot with that oath taken in our youth , we cannot with that great ideal set before us when we were a young people and numbered only a scant 3 , 000 , 000 , take upon ourselves , now that we are 100 , 000 , 000 strong , any other conception of duty than we then entertained . If American enterprise in foreign countries , particularly in those foreign countries which are not strong enough to resist us , takes the shape of imposing upon and exploiting the mass of the people of that country it ought to be checked and not encouraged . I am willing to get anything for an American that money and enterprise can obtain except the suppression of the rights of other men . I will not help any man buy a power which he ought not to exercise over his fellow beings . You know , my fellow countrymen , what a big question there is in Mexico . Eighty five per cent of the Mexican people have never been allowed to have any genuine participation in their own Government or to exercise any substantial rights with regard to the very land they live upon . All the rights that men most desire have been exercised by the other fifteen per cent . Do you suppose that that circumstance is not sometimes in my thought I know that the American people have a heart that will beat just as strong for those millions in Mexico as it will beat , or has beaten , for any other millions elsewhere in the world , and that when once they conceive what is at stake in Mexico they will know what ought to be done in Mexico . I hear a great deal said about the loss of property in Mexico and the loss of the lives of foreigners , and I deplore these things with all my heart . Undoubtedly , upon the conclusion of the present disturbed conditions in Mexico those who have been unjustly deprived of their property or in any wise unjustly put upon ought to be compensated . Men s individual rights have no doubt been invaded , and the invasion of those rights has been attended by many deplorable circumstances which ought sometime , in the proper way , to be accounted for . But back of it all is the struggle of a people to come into its own , and while we look upon the incidents in the foreground let us not forget the great tragic reality in the background which towers above the whole picture . A patriotic American is a man who is not niggardly and selfish in the things that he enjoys that make for human liberty and the rights of man . He wants to share them with the whole world , and he is never so proud of the great flag under which he lives as when it comes to mean to other people as well as to himself a symbol of hope and liberty . I would be ashamed of this flag if it ever did anything outside America that we would not permit it to do inside of America . The world is becoming more complicated every day , my fellow citizens . No man ought to be foolish enough to think that he understands it all . And , therefore , I am glad that there are some simple things in the world . One of the simple things is principle . Honesty is a perfectly simple thing . It is hard for me to believe that in most circumstances when a man has a choice of ways he does not know which is the right way and which is the wrong way . No man who has chosen the wrong way ought even to come into Independence Square it is holy ground which he ought not to tread upon . He ought not to come where immortal voices have uttered the great sentences of such a document as this Declaration of Independence upon which rests the liberty of a whole nation . And so I say that it is patriotic sometimes to prefer the honor of the country to its material interest . Would you rather be deemed by all the nations of the world incapable of keeping your treaty obligations in order that you might have free tolls for American ships The treaty under which we gave up that right may have been a mistaken treaty , but there was no mistake about its meaning . When I have made a promise as a man I try to keep it , and I know of no other rule permissible to a nation . The most distinguished nation in the world is the nation that can and will keep its promises even to its own hurt . And I want to say parenthetically that I do not think anybody was hurt . I cannot be enthusiastic for subsidies to a monopoly , but let those who are enthusiastic for subsidies ask themselves whether they prefer subsidies to unsullied honor . The most patriotic man , ladies and gentlemen , is sometimes the man who goes in the direction that he thinks right even when he sees half the world against him . It is the dictate of patriotism to sacrifice yourself if you think that that is the path of honor and of duty . Do not blame others if they do not agree with you . Do not die with bitterness in your heart because you did not convince the rest of the world , but die happy because you believe that you tried to serve your country by not selling your soul . Those were grim days , the days of 1776 . Those gentlemen did not attach their names to the Declaration of Independence on this table expecting a holiday on the next day , and that 4th of July was not itself a holiday . They attached their signatures to that significant document knowing that if they failed it was certain that every one of them would hang for the failure . They were committing treason in the interest of the liberty of 3 , 000 , 000 people in America . All the rest of the world was against them and smiled with cynical incredulity at the audacious undertaking . Do you think that if they could see this great Nation now they would regret anything that they then did to draw the gaze of a hostile world upon them Every idea must be started by somebody , and it is a lonely thing to start anything . Yet if it is in you , you must start it if you have a man s blood in you and if you love the country that you profess to be working for . I am sometimes very much interested when I see gentlemen supposing that popularity is the way to success in America . The way to success in this great country , with its fair judgments , is to show that you are not afraid of anybody except God and his final verdict . If I did not believe that , I would not believe in democracy . If I did not believe that , I would not believe that people can govern themselves . If I did not believe that the moral judgment would be the last judgment , the final judgment , in the minds of men as well as the tribunal of God , I could not believe in popular government . But I do believe these things , and , therefore , I earnestly believe in the democracy not only of America but of every awakened people that wishes and intends to govern and control its own affairs . It is very inspiring , my friends , to come to this that may be called the original fountain of independence and liberty in American and here drink draughts of patriotic feeling which seem to renew the very blood in one s veins . Down in Washington sometimes when the days are hot and the business presses intolerably and there are so many things to do that it does not seem possible to do anything in the way it ought to be done , it is always possible to lift one s thought above the task of the moment and , as it were , to realize that great thing of which we are all parts , the great body of American feeling and American principle . No man could do the work that has to be done in Washington if he allowed himself to be separated from that body of principle . He must make himself feel that he is a part of the people of the United States , that he is trying to think not only for them , but with them , and then he cannot feel lonely . He not only cannot feel lonely but he cannot feel afraid of anything . My dream is that as the years go on and the world knows more and more of America it will also drink at these fountains of youth and renewal that it also will turn to America for those moral inspirations which lie at the basis of all freedom that the world will never fear America unless it feels that it is engaged in some enterprise which is inconsistent with the rights of humanity and that America will come into the full light of the day when all shall know that she puts human rights above all other rights and that her flag is the flag not only of America but of humanity . What other great people has devoted itself to this exalted ideal To what other nation in the world can all eyes look for an instant sympathy that thrills the whole body politic when men anywhere are fighting for their rights I do not know that there will ever be a declaration of independence and of grievances for mankind , but I believe that if any such document is ever drawn it will be drawn in the spirit of the American Declaration of Independence , and that America has lifted high the light which will shine unto all generations and guide the feet of mankind to the goal of justice and liberty and peace .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Congress It is my duty to call your attention to a situation which has arisen in our dealings with General Victoriano Huerta at Mexico City which calls for action , and to ask your advice and cooperation in acting upon it . On the 9th of April a paymaster of the S . Dolphin landed at the Iturbide Bridge landing at Tampico with a whaleboat and boat s crew to take off certain supplies needed by his ship , and while engaged in loading the boat was arrested by an officer and squad of men of the army of General Huerta . Neither the paymaster nor anyone of the boat s crew was armed . Two of the men were in the boat when the arrest took place and were obliged to leave it and submit to be taken into custody , notwithstanding the fact that the boat carried , both at her bow and at her stern , the flag of the United States . The officer who made the arrest was proceeding up one of the streets of the town with his prisoners when met by an officer of higher authority , who ordered him to return to the landing and await orders and within an hour and a half from the time of the arrest orders were received from the commander of the Huertista forces at Tampico for the release of the paymaster and his men . The release was followed by apologies from the commander and later by an expression of regret by General Huerta himself . General Huerta urged that martial law obtained at the time at Tampico that orders had been issued that no one should be allowed to land at the Iturbide Bridge and that our sailors had no right to land there . Our naval commanders at the port had not been notified of any such prohibition and , even if they had been , the only justifiable course open to the local authorities would have been to request the paymaster and his crew to withdraw and to lodge a protest with the commanding officer of the fleet . Admiral Mayo regarded the arrest as so serious an affront that he was not satisfied with the apologies offered , but demanded that the flag of the United States be saluted with special ceremony by the military commander of the port . The incident cannot be regarded as a trivial one , especially as two of the men arrested were taken from the boat itself that is to say , from the territory of the United States but had it stood by itself it might have been attributed to the ignorance or arrogance of a single officer . Unfortunately , it was not an isolated case . A series of incidents have recently occurred which cannot but create the impression that the representatives of General Huerta were willing to go out of their way to show disregard for the dignity and rights of this Government and felt perfectly safe in doing what they pleased , making free to show in many ways their irritation and contempt . A few days after the incident at Tampico an orderly from the S . Minnesota was arrested at Vera Cruz while ashore in uniform to obtain the ship s mail , and was for a time thrown into jail . An official dispatch from this Government to its embassy at Mexico City was withheld by the authorities of the telegraphic service until peremptorily demanded by our charge d affaires in person . So far as I can learn , such wrongs and annoyances have been suffered to occur only against representatives of the United States . I have heard of no complaints from other Governments of similar treatment . Subsequent explanations and formal apologies did not and could not alter the popular impression , which it is possible it had been the object of the Huertista authorities to create , that the Government of the United States was being singled out , and might be singled out with impunity , for slights and affronts in retaliation for its refusal to recognize the pretensions of General Huerta to be regarded as the constitutional provisional President of the Republic of Mexico . The manifest danger of such a situation was that such offenses might grow from bad to worse until something happened of so gross and intolerable a sort as to lead directly and inevitably to armed conflict . It was necessary that the apologies of General Huerta and his representatives should go much further , that they should be such as to attract the attention of the whole population to their significance , and such as to impress upon General Huerta himself the necessity of seeing to it that no further occasion for explanations and professed regrets should arise . therefore , felt it my duty to sustain Admiral Mayo in the whole of his demand and to insist that the flag of the United States should be saluted in such a way as to indicate a new spirit and attitude on the part of the Huertistas . Such a salute General Huerta has refused , and I have come to ask your approval and support in the course I now purpose to pursue . This Government can , I earnestly hope , in no circumstances be forced into war with the people of Mexico . Mexico is torn by civil strife . If we are to accept the tests of its own constitution , it has no government . General Huerta has set his power up in the City of Mexico , such as it is , without right and by methods for which there can be no justification . Only part of the country is under his control . If armed conflict should unhappily come as a result of his attitude of personal resentment toward this Government , we should be fighting only General Huerta and those who adhere to him and give him their support , and our object would be only to restore to the people of the distracted Republic the opportunity to set up again their own laws and their own government . But I earnestly hope that war is not now in question . I believe that I speak for the American people when I say that we do not desire to control in any degree the affairs of our sister Republic . Our feeling for the people of Mexico is one of deep and genuine friendship , and everything that we have so far done or refrained from doing has proceeded from our desire to help them , not to hinder or embarrass them . We would not wish even to exercise the good offices of friendship without their welcome and consent . The people of Mexico are entitled to settle their own domestic affairs in their own way , and we sincerely desire to respect their right . The present situation need have none of the grave implications of interference if we deal with it promptly , firmly , and wisely . No doubt I could do what is necessary in the circumstances to enforce respect for our Government without recourse to the Congress , and yet not exceed my constitutional powers as President but I do not wish to act in a matter possibly of so grave consequence except in close conference and cooperation with both the Senate and House . therefore , come to ask your approval that I should use the armed forces of the United States in such ways and to such an extent as may be necessary to obtain from General Huerta and his adherents the fullest recognition of the rights and dignity of the United States , even amidst the distressing conditions now unhappily obtaining in Mexico . There can in what we do be no thought of aggression or of selfish aggrandizement . We seek to maintain the dignity and authority of the United States only because we wish always to keep our great influence unimpaired for the uses of liberty , both in the United States and wherever else it may be employed for the benefit of mankind .<speech_sep>TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES I sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this session of the Congress . I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this time . Happily , I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly second . In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs growing out of Federal control , I shall take the liberty at a later date of addressing you . I hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a budget system . That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not independently of each other , but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related to the nation s income , there can be no doubtI believe the burden of preparing the budget must , in the nature of the case , if the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided , rest upon the executive . The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved or amended by a single committee of each House of Congress and no single appropriation should be made by the Congress , except such as may have been included in the budget prepared by the executive or added by the particular committee of Congress charged with the budget legislation . Another and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended . Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appropriations . No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely , economically and effectively . The auditors should be highly trained officials with permanent tenure in the Treasury Department , free of obligations to or motives of consideration for this or any subsequent administration , and authorized and empowered to examine into and make report upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the Government . Their reports should be made to the Congress and to the Secretary of the Treasury . I trust that the Congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation . Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity . These taxes performed indispensable service during the war . They must , however , be simplified , not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense , but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite . With reference to the details of the Revenue Law , the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of the law recommendations which have my approval and support . It is of the utmost importance that in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920 payable in the calendar year 1921 . The Congress might well consider whether the higher rates of income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of revenue , and whether they may not , on the contrary , be destructive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency . There is a point at which in peace times high rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy , remove the incentive to new enterprises , encourage extravagant expenditures and produce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evils . The problem is not an easy one . A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of America in the world s affairs . The prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy between two schools of political and economic thought , the one believers in protection of American industries , the other believers in tariff for revenue only , must be sbordinated to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly changed conditions . Before the war America was heavily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payments she had to make to foreign countries on American securities held abroad , the expenditures of American travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges she had to pay to others , about balanced the value of her pre war favorable balance of trade . During the war America s exports nave been greatly stimulated , and increased prices have increased their value . On the other hand , she has purchased a large proportion of the American securities previously held abroad , has loaned some 9 , 000 , 000 , 000 to foreign governments , and has built her own ships . Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly increased and Europe has been deprived of the means of meeting it heretofore existing . Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade in peace times by imports into this country of gold or of goods , or by establishing new credits . Europe is in no position at the present time to ship gold to us nor could we contemplate large further imports of gold into this country without concern . The time has nearly passed for international governmental loans and it will take time to develop in this country a market for foreign securities . Anything , therefore , which would tend to prevent foreign countries from settling for our exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from paying for our exports and therefore of preventing the exports from being made . The productivity of the country , greatly stimulated by the war , must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries , and any measures taken to prevent imports will inevitably curtail exports , force curtailment of production , load the banking machinery of the country with credits to carry unsold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment . If we want to sell , we must be prepared to buy . Whatever , therefore , may have been our views during the period of growth of American business concerning tariff legislation , we must now adjust our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of the fact that American business is full grown and that America is the greatest capitalist in the world . No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of America . The provincial standards and policies of the past , which have held American business as if in a strait jacket , must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live , a day full of hope and promise for American business , if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking . The recent war has ended our isolation and thrown upon us a great duty and responsibility . The United States must share the expanding world market . The United States desires for itself only equal opportunity with the other nations of the world , and that through the process of friendly cooperation and fair competition the legitimate interests of the nations concerned may be successfully and equitably adjusted . There are other matters of importance upon which I urged action at the last session of Congress which are still pressing for solution . I am sure it is not necessary for me again to remind you that there is one immediate and very practicable question resulting from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit . It is a matter of recognition and relief to our soldiers . I can do no better than to quote from my last message urging this very action We must see to it that our returning soldiers are assisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country . This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organization created by the Department of Labor for placing men seeking work and it can also be done , in at least one very great field , by creating new opportunities for individual enterprise . The Secretary of the Interior has pointed out the way by which returning soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto undeveloped regions of the country which the Federal Government has already prepared , or can readily prepare , for cultivation and also on many of the cutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive the immediate and substantial support of the Congress . In the matter of tariff legislation , I beg to call your attention to the statements contained in my last message urging legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuffs industry in America Among the industries to which special consideration should be given is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals . Our complete dependence upon German supplies before the war made the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance . The close relation between the manufacture of dyestuffs , on the one hand , and of explosive and poisonous gases , on the other , moreover , has given the industry an exceptional significance and value . Although the United States will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the programme of international disarmament , it will , nevertheless , be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the successful maintenance of many strong and well equipped chemical plants . The German chemical industry , with which we will be brought into competition , was and may well be again , a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind . During the war the farmer performed a vital and willing service to the nation . By materially increasing the production of his land , he supplied America and the Allies with the increased amounts of food necessary to keep their immense armies in the field . He indispensably helped to win the war . But there is now scarcely less need of increasing the production in food and the necessaries of life . I ask the Congress to consider means of encouraging effort along these lines . The importance of doing everything possible to promote production along economical lines , to improve marketing , and to make rural life more attractive and healthful , is obvious . I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the Congress by the Secretary of Agriculture , to secure the essential facts required for the proper study of this question , through the proposed enlarged programmes for farm management studies and crop estimates . I would urge , also , the continuance of Federal participation in the building of good roads , under the terms of existing law and under the direction of present agencies the need of further action on the part of the States and the Federal Government to preserve and develop our forest resources , especially through the practice of better forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests better support for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems and fuller provision for sanitation in rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and medical facilities in these localities . Perhaps the way might be cleared for many of these desirable reforms by a fresh , comprehensive survey made of rural conditions by a conference composed of representatives of the farmers and of the agricultural agencies responsible for leadership . I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political restlessness in our body politic . The causes of this unrest , while various and complicated , are superficial rather than deep seated . Broadly , they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our Government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace permitting return to normal conditions , from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers pending such delay , from heartless profiteering resulting in the increase of the cost of living , and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators . With the return to normal conditions , this unrest will rapidly disappear . In the meantime , it does much evil . It seems to me that in dealing with this situation Congress should not be impatient or drastic but should seek rather to remove the causes . It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis , with ameliorated living conditions under the minimum of restrictions upon personal liberty that is consistent with our reconstruction problems . And it should arm the Federal Government with power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time tested institutions . With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change , however fundamental , there must be no interference , but towards passion and malevolence tendine to incite crime and insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency . Legislation to this end has been recommended by the Attorney General and should be enacted . In this direct connection , I would call your attention to my recommendations on August 8th , pointing out legislative measures which wouldbe effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living , which contributes so largely to this unrest . On only one of these recommendations has the Congress acted . If the Government s campaign is to be effective , it is necessary that the other steps suggested should be acted on at once . I renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present Food Control Act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in operation . The Attorney General has submitted a bill providing for an extension of this Act for a period of six months . As it now stands , it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace . It is imperative that it should be extended at once . The Department of justice has built up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing its provisions all of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provisions of this Act are extended . During this period the Congress will have an opportunity to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate shipment , if the requirements of the law are not compiled with . Some such regulation is imperatively necessary . The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented . There can be no doubt of either the necessity of the legitimacy of such measures . As I pointed out in my last message , publicity can accomplish a great deal in this campaign . The aims of the Government must be clearly brought to the attention of the consuming public , civic organizations and state officials , who are in a position to lend their assistance to our efforts . You have made available funds with which to carry on this campaign , but there is no provision in the law authorizing their expenditure for the purpose of making the public fully informed about the efforts of the Government . Specific recommendation has been made by the Attorney General in this regard . I would strongly urge upon you its immediate adoption , as it constitutes one of the preliminary steps to this campaign . I also renew my recommendation that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated , for example , by the laws of the State of New Jersey , which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage , prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period , and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt . It would materially add to the serviceability of the law , for the purpose we now have in view , if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went into storage . By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer . I would also renew my recommendation that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case , where their form or package makes it possible , be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer . We should formulate a law requiring a Federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license or in the conditions under which it is to be issued , specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing . Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the business of interstate shipment and in the methods of corporations which are engaged in it but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object immediately in hand , which is to lower the cost of living . No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite programme to bring about an improvement in the conditions of labor . There can be no settled conditions leading to increased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be antagonists instead of partners . Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the interests of the whole nation , as distinguished from the interests of a class , must be applied to the solution of this great and pressing problem . The failure of other nations to consider this matter in a vigorous way has produced bitterness and jealousies and antagonisms , the food of radicalism . The only way to keep men from agitating against grievances is to remove the grievances . An unwillingness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression . The seed of revolution is repression . The remedy for these things must not be negative in character . It must be constructive . It must comprehend the general interest . The real antidote for the unrest which manifests itself is not suppression , but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy . Congress has already shown its willingness to deal with these industrial wrongs by establishing the eight hour day as the standard in every field of labor . It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor . It has served the whole country by leading the way in developing the means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health in dangerous industries . It must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine democratization of industry , based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work , in whatever rank , to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare . It is with this purpose in mind that I called a conference to meet in Washington on December 1st , to consider these problems in all their broad aspects , with the idea of bringing about a better understanding between these two interests . The great unrest throughout the world , out of which has emerged a demand for an immediate consideration of the difficulties between capital and labor , bids us put our own house in order . Frankly , there can be no permanent and lasting settlements between capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been struggling through the years . The whole world gave its recognition and endorsement to these fundamental purposes in the League of Nations . The statesmen gathered at Versailles recognized the fact that world stability could not be had by reverting to industrial standards and conditions against which the average workman of the world had revolted . It is , therefore , the task of the statesmen of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world conditions and to seek to bring about , through legislation , conditions that will mean the ending of age long antagonisms between capital and labor and that will hopefully lead to the building up of a comradeship which will result not only in greater contentment among the mass of workmen but also bring about a greater production and a greater prosperity to business itself . To analyze the particulars in the demands of labor is to admit the justice of their complaint in many matters that lie at their basis . The workman demands an adequate wage , sufficient to permit him to live in comfort , unhampered by the fear of poverty and want in his old age . He demands the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surroundings , both in home and in workshop , surroundings that develop and do not retard his own health and wellbeing and the right to provide for his children s wants in the matter of health and education . In other words , it is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the lives of those dear to him tolerable and easy to bear . The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the covenant of the League of Nations offers us the way to industrial peace and conciliation . No other road lies open to us . Not to pursue this one is longer to invite enmities , bitterness , and antagonisms which in the end only lead to industrial and social disaster . The unwilling workman is not a profitable servant . An employee whose industrial life is hedged about by hard and unjust conditions , which he did not create and over which he has no control , lacks that fine spirit of enthusiasm and volunteer effort which are the necessary ingredients of a great producing entity . Let us be frank about this solemn matter . The evidences of world wide unrest which manifest themselves in violence throughout the world bid us pause and consider the means to be found to stop the spread of this contagious thing before it saps the very vitality of the nation itself . Do we gain strength by withholding the remedy Or is it not the business of statesmen to treat these manifestations of unrest which meet us on every hand as evidences of an economic disorder and to apply constructive remedies wherever necessary , being sure that in the application of the remedy we touch not the vital tissues of our industrial and economic life There can be no recession of the tide of unrest until constructive instrumentalities are set up to stem that tide . Governments must recognize the right of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have at their base the mutual protection and welfare of those engaged in all industries . Labor must not be longer treated as a commodity . It must be regarded as the activity of human beings , possessed of deep yearnings and desires . The busi ness man gives his best thought to the repair and replenishment of his machinery , so that its usefulness will not be impaired and its power to produce may always be at its height and kept in full vigor and motion . No less regard ought to be paid to the human machine , which after all propels the machinery of the world and is the great dynamic force that lies back of all industry and progress . Return to the old standards of wage and industry in employment are unthinkable . The terrible tragedy of war which has just ended and which has brought the world to the verge of chaos and disaster would be in vain if there should ensue a return to the conditions of the past . Europe itself , whence has come the unrest which now holds the world at bay , is an example of standpatism in these vital human matters which America might well accept as an example , not to be followed but studiously to be avoided . Europe made labor the differential , and the price of it all is enmity and antagonism and prostrated industry , The right of labor to live in peace and comfort must be recognized by governments and America should be the first to lay the foundation stones upon which industrial peace shall be built . Labor not only is entitled to an adequate wage , but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its investment and is entitled to protection at the hands of the Government in every emergency . No Government worthy of the name can play these elements against each other , for there is a mutuality of interest between them which the Government must seek to express and to safeguard at all cost . The right of individuals to strike is inviolate and ought not to be interfered with by any process of Government , but there is a predominant right and that is the right of the Government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class . The Government , when it asserts that right , seeks not to antagonize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and injury that might be done by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only Government itself has a right to exercise as a protection to all . In the matter of international disputes which have led to war , statesmen have sought to set up as a remedy arbitration for war . Does this not point the way for the settlement of industrial disputes , by the establishment of a tribunal , fair and just alike to all , which will settle industrial disputes which in the past have led to war and disaster America , witnessing the evil consequences which have followed out of such disputes between these contending forces , must not admit itself impotent to deal with these matters by means of peaceful processes . Surely , there must be some method of bringing together in a council of peace and amity these two great interests , out of which will come a happier day of peace and cooperation , a day that will make men more hopeful and enthusiastic in their various tasks , that will make for more comfort and happiness in living and a more tolerable condition among all classes of men . Certainly human intelligence can devise some acceptable tribunal for adjusting the differences between capital and labor . This is the hour of test and trial for America . By her prowess and strength , and the indomitable courage of her soldiers , she demonstrated her power to vindicate on foreign battlefields her conceptions of liberty and justice . Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concern be proclaimed to the world . There are those in this country who threaten direct action to force their will , upon a majority . Russia today , with its blood and terror , is a painful object lesson of the power of minorities . It makes little difference what minority it is whether capital or labor , or any other class no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country . We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while . We are a democracy , where the majority are the masters , or all the hopes and purposes of the men who founded this government have been defeated and forgotten . In America there is but one way by which great reforms can be accomplished and the relief sought by classes obtained , and that is through the orderly processes of representative government . Those who would propose any other method of reform are enemies of this country . America will not be daunted by threats nor lose her composure or calmness in these distressing times . We can afford , in the midst of this day of passion and unrest , to be self contained and sure . The instrument of all reform in America is the ballot . The road to economic and social reform in America is the straight road of justice to all classes and conditions of men . Men have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes . Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and revolution . The right road is the road of justice and orderly process .<speech_sep>President , Gentlemen of the American Bar Association I am very deeply gratified by the greeting that your president has given me and by your response to it . My only strength lies in your confidence . We stand now in a peculiar case . Our first thought , I suppose , as lawyers , is of international law , of those bonds of right and principle which draw the nations together and hold the community of the world to some standards of action . We know that we see in international law , as it were , the moral processes by which law itself came into existence . I know that as a lawyer I have myself at times felt that there was no real comparison between the law of a nation and the law of nations , because the latter lacked the sanction that gave the former strength and validity . And yet , if you look into the matter more closely , you will find that the two have the same foundations , and that those foundations are more evident and conspicuous in our day than they have ever been before . The opinion of the world is the mistress of the world and the processes of international law are the slow processes by which opinion works its will . What impresses me is the constant thought that that is the tribunal at the bar of which we all sit . I would call your attention , incidentally , to the circumstance that it does not observe the ordinary rules of evidence which has sometimes suggested to me that the ordinary rules of evidence had shown some signs of growing antique . Everything , rumor included , is heard in this court , and the standard of judgment is not so much the character of the testimony as the character of the witness . The motives are disclosed , the purposes are conjectured , and that opinion is finally accepted which seems to be , not the best founded in law , perhaps , but the best founded in integrity of character and of morals . That is the process which is slowly working its will upon the world and what we should be watchful of is not so much jealous interests as sound principles of action . The disinterested course is always the biggest course to pursue not only , but it is in the long run the most profitable course to pursue . If you can establish your character , you can establish your credit . What I wanted to suggest to this association , in bidding them very hearty welcome to the city , is whether we sufficiently apply these same ideas to the body of municipal law which we seek to administer . Citations seem to play so much larger a role now than principle . There was a time when the thoughtful eye of the judge rested upon the changes of social circumstances and almost palpably saw the law arise out of human life . Have we got to a time when the only way to change law is by statute The changing of law by statute seems to me like mending a garment with a patch , whereas law should grow by the life that is in it , not by the life that is outside of it . I once said to a lawyer with whom I was discussing some question of precedent , and in whose presence I was venturing to doubt the rational validity , at any rate , of the particular precedents he cited , After all , is not our object justice And he said , God forbid We should be very much confused if we made that our standard . Our standard is to find out what the rule has been and how the rule that has been applies to the case that is . I should hate to think that the law was based entirely upon has beens . I should hate to think that the law did not derive its impulse from looking forward rather than from looking backward , or , rather , that it did not derive its instruction from looking about and seeing what the circumstances of man actually are and what the impulses of justice necessarily are . Understand me , gentlemen , I am not venturing in this presence to impeach the law . For the present , by the force of circumstances , I am in part the embodiment of the law , and it would be very awkward to disavow myself . But I do wish to make this intimation , that in this time of world change , in this time when we are going to find out just how , in what particulars , and to what extent the real facts of human life and the real moral judgments of mankind prevail , it is worth while looking inside our municipal law and seeing whether the judgments of the law are made square with the moral judgments of mankind . For I believe that we are custodians , not of commands , but of a spirit . We are custodians of the spirit of righteousness , of the spirit of equal handed justice , of the spirit of hope which believes in the perfectibility of the law with the perfectibility of human life itself . Public life , like private life , would be very dull and dry if it were not for this belief in the essential beauty of the human spirit and the belief that the human spirit could be translated into action and into ordinance . Not entire . You cannot go any faster than you can advance the average moral judgments of the mass , but you can go at least as fast as that , and you can see to it that you do not lag behind the average moral judgments of the mass . I have in my life dealt with all sorts and conditions of men , and I have found that the flame of moral judgment burned just as bright in the man of humble life and limited experience as in the scholar and the man of affairs . And I would like his voice always to be heard , not as a witness , not as speaking in his own case , but as if he were the voice of men in general , in our courts of justice , as well as the voice of the lawyers , remembering what the law has been . My hope is that , being stirred to the depths by the extraordinary circumstances of the time in which we live , we may recover from those depths something of a renewal of that vision of the law with which men may be supposed to have started out in the old days of the oracles , who communed with the intimations of divinity .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Congress I have again asked the privilege of addressing you because we are moving through critical times during which it seems to me to be my duty to keep in close touch with the Houses of Congress , so that neither counsel nor action shall run at cross purposes between us . On the third of February I officially informed you of the sudden and unexpected action of the Imperial German Government in declaring its intention to disregard the promises it had made to this Government in April last and undertake immediate submarine operations against all commerce , whether of belligerents or of neutrals , that should seek to approach Great Britain and Ireland , the Atlantic coasts of Europe , or the harbors of the eastern Mediterranean , and to conduct those operations without regard to the established restrictions of international practice , without regard to any considerations of humanity even which might interfere with their object . That policy was forthwith put into practice . It has now been in active execution for nearly four weeks . Its practical results are not yet fully disclosed . The commerce of other neutral nations is suffering severely , but not , perhaps , very much more severely than it was already suffering before the first of February , when the new policy of the Imperial Government was put into operation . We have asked the cooperation of the other neutral governments to prevent these depredations , but so far none of them has thought it wise to join us in any common course of action . Our own commerce has suffered , is suffering , rather in apprehension than in fact , rather because so many of our ships are timidly keeping to their home ports than because American ships have been sunk . Two American vessels have been sunk , the Housatonic and the Lyman Law . The case of the Housatonic , which was carrying food stuffs consigned to a London firm , was essentially like the case of the Fry , in which , it will be recalled , the German Government admitted its liability for damages , and the lives of the crew , as in the case of the Fry , were safeguarded with reasonable care . The case of the Law , which was carrying lemon box staves to Palermo , disclosed a ruthlessness of method which deserves grave condemnation , but was accompanied by no circumstances which might not have been expected at any time in connection with the use of the submarine against merchantmen as the German Government has used it . In sum , therefore , the situation we find ourselves in with regard to the actual conduct of the German submarine warfare against commerce and its effects upon our own ships and people is substantially the same that it was when I addressed you on the third of February , except for the tying up of our shipping in our own ports because of the unwillingness of our shipowners to risk their vessels at sea without insurance or adequate protection , and the very serious congestion of our commerce which has resulted , a congestion which is growing rapidly more and more serious every day . This in itself might presently accomplish , in effect , what the new German submarine orders were meant to accomplish , so far as we are concerned . We can only say , therefore , that the overt act which I have ventured to hope the German commanders would in fact avoid has not occurred . But , while this is happily true , it must be admitted that there have been certain additional indications and expressions of purpose on the part of the German press and the German authorities which have increased rather than lessened the impression that , if our ships and our people are spared , it will be because of fortunate circumstances or because the commanders of the German submarines which they may happen to encounter exercise an unexpected discretion and restraint rather than because of the instructions under which those commanders are acting . It would be foolish to deny that the situation is fraught with the gravest possibilities and dangers . No thoughtful man can fail to see that the necessity for definite action may come at any time , if we are in fact , and not in word merely , to defend our elementary rights as a neutral nation . It would be most imprudent to be unprepared . I cannot in such circumstances be unmindful of the fact that the expiration of the term of the present Congress is immediately at hand , by constitutional limitation and that it would in all likelihood require an unusual length of time to assemble and organize the Congress which is to succeed it . I feel that I ought , in view of that fact , to obtain from you full and immediate assurance of the authority which I may need at any moment to exercise . No doubt I already possess that authority without special warrant of law , by the plain implication of my constitutional duties and powers but I prefer , in the present circumstances , not to act upon general implication . I wish to feel that the authority and the power of the Congress are behind me in whatever it may become necessary for me to do . We are jointly the servants of the people and must act together and in their spirit , so far as we can divine and interpret it . No one doubts what it is our duty to do . We must defend our commerce and the lives of our people in the midst of the present trying circumstances , with discretion but with clear and steadfast purpose . Only the method and the extent remain to be chosen , upon the occasion , if occasion should indeed arise . Since it has unhappily proved impossible to safeguard our neutral rights by diplomatic means against the unwarranted infringements they are suffering at the hands of Germany , there may be no recourse but to armed neutrality , which we shall know how to maintain and for which there is abundant American precedent . It is devoutly to be hoped that it will not be necessary to put armed force anywhere into action . The American people do not desire it , and our desire is not different from theirs . I am sure that they will understand the spirit in which I am now acting , the purpose I hold nearest my heart and would wish to exhibit in everything I do . I am anxious that the people of the nations at war also should understand and not mistrust us . I hope that I need give no further proofs and assurances than I have already given throughout nearly three years of anxious patience that I am the friend of peace and mean to preserve it for America so long as I am able . I am not now proposing or contemplating war or any steps that need lead to it . I merely request that you will accord me by your own vote and definite bestowal the means and the authority to safeguard in practice the right of a great people who are at peace and who are desirous of exercising none but the rights of peace to follow the pursuits of peace in quietness and good will , rights recognized time out of mind by all the civilized nations of the world . No course of my choosing or of theirs will lead to war . War can come only by the wilful acts and aggressions of others . You will understand why I can make no definite proposals or forecasts of action now and must ask for your supporting authority in the most general terms . The form in which action may become necessary cannot yet be foreseen . I believe that the people will be willing to trust me to act with restraint , with prudence , and in the true spirit of amity and good faith that they have themselves displayed throughout these trying months and it is in that belief that I request that you will authorize me to supply our merchant ships with defensive arms , should that become necessary , and with the means of using them , and to employ any other instrumentalities or methods that may be necessary and adequate to protect our ships and our people in their legitimate and peaceful pursuits on the seas . I request also that you will grant me at the same time , along with the powers I ask , a sufficient credit to enable me to provide adequate means of protection where they are lacking , including adequate insurance against the present war risks . I have spoken of our commerce and of the legitimate errands of our people on the seas , but you will not be misled as to my main thought , the thought that lies beneath these phrases and gives them dignity and weight . It is not of material interests merely that we are thinking . It is , rather , of fundamental human rights , chief of all the right of life itself . I am thinking , not only of the rights of Americans to go and come about their proper business by way of the sea , but also of something much deeper , much more fundamental than that . I am thinking of those rights of humanity without which there is no civilization . My theme is of those great principles of compassion and of protection which mankind has sought to throw about human lives , the lives of non combatants , the lives of men who are peacefully at work keeping the industrial processes of the world quick and vital , the lives of women and children and of those who supply the labor which ministers to their sustenance . We are speaking of no selfish material rights but of rights which our hearts support and whose foundation is that righteous passion for justice upon which all law , all structures alike of family , of state , and of mankind must rest , as upon the ultimate base of our existence and our liberty . I cannot imagine any man with American principles at his heart hesitating to defend these things .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas , Congress has enacted and the President has on the 18th day of May , 1917 , approved a law which contains the following provisions Section 5 . That all male persons between the ages of twenty one and thirty , both inclusive , shall be subject to registration in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the President , and upon proclamation by the President or other public notice given by him or by his direction , stating the time and place of such registration , it shall be the duty of all persons of the designated ages , except officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army , the Navy and the National Guard and Naval Militia while in the service of the United States , to present themselves for and submit to registration under the provisions of this act . And every such person shall be deemed to have notice of the requirements of this act upon the publication of said proclamation or other notice as aforesaid given by the President or by his direction . And any person who shall wilfully fail or refuse to present himself for registration or to submit thereto as herein provided , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall , upon conviction in the District Court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof , be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year , and shall thereupon be duly registered . Provided , that in the call of the docket preference shall be given , in courts trying the same , to the trial of criminal proceedings under this act . Provided , further , that persons shall be subject to registration as herein provided who shall have attained their twenty first birthday and who shall not have attained their thirty first birthday on or before the day set for the registration , and all persons so registered shall be and remain subject to draft into the forces hereby authorized unless exempted or excused therefrom , as in this act provided . Provided , further , that in the case of temporary absence from actual place of legal residence of any person liable to registration as provided herein , such registration may be made by mail under regulations to be prescribed by the President . Section 6 . That the President is hereby authorized to utilize the service of any or all departments and any or all officers or agents of the United States and of the several States , Territories and the District of Columbia and subdivisions thereof , in the execution of this act , and all officers and agents of the United States and of the several States , Territories and subdivisions thereof , and of the District of Columbia , and all persons designated or appointed under regulations prescribed by the President , whether such appointments are made by the President himself or by the Governor or other officer of any State or Territory to perform any duty in the execution of this act , are hereby required to perform such duty as the President shall order or direct , and all such officers and agents and persons so designated or appointed shall hereby have full authority for all acts done by them in the execution of this act , by the direction of the President . Correspondence in the execution of this act may be carried in penalty envelopes bearing the frank of the War Department . Any person charged , as herein provided , with the duty of carrying into effect any of the provisions of this act or the regulations made or directions given thereunder who shall fail or neglect to perform such duty , and any person charged with such duty or having and exercising any authority under said act , regulations or directions , who shall knowingly make or be a party to the making of any false or incorrect registration , physical examination , exemption , enlistment , enrolment or muster . And any person who shall make or be a party to the making of any false statement or certificate as to the fitness or liability of himself or any other person for service under the provisions of this act , or regulations made by the President thereunder , or otherwise evades or aids another to evade the requirements of this act or of said regulations , or who , in any manner , shall fail or neglect fully to perform any duty required of him in the execution of this act , shall , if not subject to military law , be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction in the District Court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year , or , if subject to military law , shall be tried by court martial and suffer such punishment as a court martial may direct . Now , Therefore , Woodrow Wilson , President of the United States , do call upon the Governor of each of the several States and Territories , the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia and all officers and agents of the several States and Territories , of the District of Columbia , and of the counties and municipalities therein , to perform certain duties in the execution of the foregoing law , which duties will be communicated to them directly in regulations of even date herewith . And I do further proclaim and give notice to all persons subject to registration in the several States and in the District of Columbia , in accordance with the above law , that the time and place of such registration shall be between 7 and 7 on the 5th day of June , 1917 , at the registration place in the precinct wherein they have their permanent homes . Those who shall have attained their twenty first birthday and who shall not have attained their thirty first birthday on or before the day here named are required to register , excepting only officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army , the Navy , the Marine Corps and the National Guard and Naval Militia while in the service of the United States , and officers in the Officers Reserve Corps and enlisted men in the enlisted Reserve Corps while in active service . In the Territories of Alaska , Hawaii and Porto Rico a day for registration will be named in a later proclamation . And I do hereby charge those who , through sickness , shall be unable to present themselves for registration that they apply on or before the day of registration to the County Clerk of the county where they may be for instructions as to how they may be registered by agent . Those who expect to be absent on the day named from the counties in which they have their permanent homes may register by mail , but their mailed registration cards must reach the places in which they have their permanent homes by the day named herein . They should apply as soon as practicable to the County Clerk of the county wherein they may be for instructions as to how they may accomplish their registration by mail . In case such persons as , through sickness or absence , may be unable to present themselves personally for registration shall be sojourning in cities of over 30 , 000 population , they shall apply to the City Clerk of the city wherein they may be sojourning rather than to the Clerk of the county . The Clerks of counties and of cities of over 30 , 000 population , in which numerous applications from the sick and from non residents are expected , are authorized to establish such sub agencies and to employ and deputize such clerical force as may be necessary to accommodate these applications . The Power against which we are arrayed has sought to impose its will upon the world by force . To this end it has increased armament until it has changed the face of war . In the sense in which we have been wont to think of armies there are no armies in this struggle , there are entire nations armed . Thus , the men who remain to till the soil and man the factories are no less a part of the army that is in France than the men beneath the battle flags . It must be so with us . It is not an army that we must shape and train for war it is a Nation . To this end our people must draw close in one compact front against a common foe . But this cannot be if each man pursues a private purpose . All must pursue one purpose . The Nation needs all men , but it needs each man , not in the field that will most pleasure him , but in the endeavor that will best serve the common good . Thus , though a sharpshooter pleases to operate a trip hammer for the forging of great guns , and an expert machinist desires to march with the flag , the Nation is being served only when the sharpshooter marches and the machinist remains at his levers . The whole Nation must be a team , in which each man shall play the part for which he is best fitted . To this end Congress has provided that the Nation shall be organized for war by selection , that each man shall be classified for service in the place to which it shall best serve the general good to call him . The significance of this cannot be overstated . It is a new thing in our history and a landmark in our progress . It is a new manner of accepting and vitalizing our duty to give ourselves with thoughtful devotion to the common purpose of us all . It is in no sense a conscription of the unwilling . It is , rather , selection from a Nation which has volunteered in mass . It is no more a choosing of those who shall march with the colors than it is a selection of those who shall serve an equally necessary and devoted purpose in the industries that lie behind the battle lines . The day here named is the time upon which all shall present themselves for assignment to their tasks . It is for that reason destined to be remembered as one of the most conspicuous moments in our history . It is nothing less than the day upon which the manhood of the country shall step forward in one solid rank in defense of the ideals to which this Nation is consecrated . It is important to those ideals , no less than to the pride of this generation in manifesting its devotion to them , that there be no gaps in the ranks . It is essential that the day be approached in thoughtful apprehension of its significance and that we accord to it the honor and the meaning that it deserves . Our industrial need prescribes that it be not made a technical holiday , but the stern sacrifice that is before us urges that it be carried in all our hearts as a great day of patriotic devotion and obligation , when the duty shall lie upon every man , whether he is himself to be registered or not , to see to it that the name of every male person of the designated ages is written on these lists of honor . In Witness Whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington this 18th day of May , in the year of our Lord , 1917 , and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty first .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Congress The Imperial German Government on the thirty first of January announced to this Government and to the governments of the other neutral nations that on and after the first day of February , the present month , it would adopt a policy with regard to the use of submarines against all shipping seeking to pass through certain designated areas of the high seas to which it is clearly my duty to call your attention . Let me remind the Congress that on the eighteenth of April last , in view of the sinking on the twenty fourth of March of the cross Channel passenger steamer Sussex by a German submarine , without summons or warning , and the consequent loss of the lives of several citizens of the United States who were passengers aboard her , this Government addressed a note to the Imperial German Government in which it made the following declaration If it is still the purpose of the Imperial Government to prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels of commerce by the use of submarines without regard to what the Government of the United States must consider the sacred and indisputable rules of international law and the universally recognized dictates of humanity , the Government of the United States is at last forced to the conclusion that there is but one course it can pursue . Unless the Imperial Government should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of submarine warfare against passenger and freight carrying vessels , the Government of the United States can have no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with the German Empire altogether . In reply to this declaration the Imperial German Government gave this Government the following assurance The German Government is prepared to do its utmost to confine the operations of war for the rest of its duration to the fighting forces of the belligerents , thereby also insuring the freedom of the seas , a principle upon which the German Government believes , now as before , to be in agreement with the Government of the United States . The German Government , guided by this idea , notifies the Government of the United States that the German naval forces have received the following orders In accordance with the general principles of visit and search and destruction of merchant vessels recognized by international law , such vessels , both within and without the area declared as naval war zone , shall not be sunk without warning and without saving human lives , unless these ships attempt to escape or offer resistance . But , it added , neutrals cannot expect that Germany , forced to fight for her existence , shall , for the sake of neutral interest , restrict the use of an effective weapon if her enemy is permitted to continue to apply at will methods of warfare violating the rules of international law . Such a demand would be incompatible with the character of neutrality , and the German Government is convinced that the Government of the United States does not think of making such a demand , knowing that the Government of the United States has repeatedly declared that it is determined to restore the principle of the freedom of the seas , from whatever quarter it has been violated . To this the Government of the United States replied on the eighth of May , accepting , of course , the assurances given , but adding , The Government of the United States feels it necessary to state that it takes it for granted that the Imperial German Government does not intend to imply that the maintenance of its newly announced policy is in any way contingent upon the course or result of diplomatic negotiations between the Government of the United States and any other belligerent Government , notwithstanding the fact that certain passages in the Imperial Government s note of the fourth instant might appear to be susceptible of that construction . In order , however , to avoid any possible misunderstanding , the Government of the United States notifies the Imperial Government that it cannot for a moment entertain , much less discuss , a suggestion that respect by German naval authorities for the rights of citizens of the United States upon the high seas should in any way or in the slightest degree be made contingent upon the conduct of any other Government affecting the rights of neutrals and non combatants . Responsibility in such matters is single , not joint absolute , not relative . To this note of the eighth of May the Imperial German Government made no reply . On the thirty first of January , the Wednesday of the present week , the German Ambassador handed to the Secretary of State , along with a formal note , a memorandum which contains the following statement The Imperial Government , therefore , does not doubt that the Government of the United States will understand the situation thus forced upon Germany by the Entente Allies brutal methods of war and by their determination to destroy the Central Powers , and that the Government of the United States will further realize that the now openly disclosed intentions of the Entente Allies give back to Germany the freedom of action which she reserved in her note addressed to the Government of the United States on May 4 , 1916 . Under these circumstances Germany will meet the illegal measures of her enemies by forcibly preventing after February 1 , 1917 , in a zone around Great Britain , France , Italy , and in the Eastern Mediterranean all navigation , that of neutrals included , from and to England and from and to France , etc . , etc . All ships met within the zone will be sunk . I think that you will agree with me that , in view of this declaration , which suddenly and without prior intimation of any kind deliberately withdraws the solemn assurance given in the Imperial Government s note of the fourth of May , 1916 , this Government has no alternative consistent with the dignity and honor of the United States but to take the course which , in its note of the eighteenth of April , 1916 , it announced that it would take in the event that the German Government did not declare and effect an abandonment of the methods of submarine warfare which it was then employing and to which it now purposes again to resort . I have , therefore , directed the Secretary of State to announce to His Excellency the German Ambassador that all diplomatic relations between the United States and the German Empire are severed , and that the American Ambassador at Berlin will immediately be withdrawn and , in accordance with this decision , to hand to His Excellency his passports . Notwithstanding this unexpected action of the German Government , this sudden and deeply deplorable renunciation of its assurances , given this Government at one of the most critical moments of tension in the relations of the two governments , I refuse to believe that it is the intention of the German authorities to do in fact what they have warned us they will feel at liberty to do . I cannot bring myself to believe that they will indeed pay no regard to the ancient friendship between their people and our own or to the solemn obligations which have been exchanged between them and destroy American ships and take the lives of American citizens in the willful prosecution of the ruthless naval program they have announced their intention to adopt . Only actual overt acts on their part can make me believe it even now . If this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent foresight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded if American ships and American lives should in fact be sacrificed by their naval commanders in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable understandings of international law and the obvious dictates of humanity , I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress , to ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary for the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas . I can do nothing less . I take it for granted that all neutral governments will take the same course . We do not desire any hostile conflict with the Imperial German Government . We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with the Government which speaks for them . We shall not believe that they are hostile to us unless and until we are obliged to believe it and we purpose nothing more than the reasonable defense of the undoubted rights of our people . We wish to serve no selfish ends . We seek merely to stand true alike in thought and in action to the immemorial principles of our people which I sought to express in my address to the Senate only two weeks ago , seek merely to vindicate our right to liberty and justice and an unmolested life . These are the bases of peace , not war . God grant we may not be challenged to defend them by acts of wilful injustice on the part of the Government of Germany<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Gentlemen of the Congress It is under the compulsion of what seems to me a clear and imperative duty that I have a second time this session sought the privilege of addressing you in person . I know , of course , that the heated season of the year is upon us , that work in these chambers and in the committee rooms is likely to become a burden as the season lengthens , and that every consideration of personal convenience and personal comfort , perhaps , in the cases of some of us , considerations of personal health even , dictate an early conclusion of the deliberations of the session but there are occasions of public duty when these things which touch us privately seem very small , when the work to be done is so pressing and so fraught with big consequence that we know that we are not at liberty to weigh against it any point of personal sacrifice . We are now in the presence of such an occasion . It is absolutely imperative that we should give the business men of this country a banking and currency system by means of which they can make use of the freedom of enterprise and of individual initiative which we are about to bestow upon them . We are about to set them free we must not leave them without the tools of action when they are free . We are about to set them free by removing the trammels of the protective tariff . Ever since the Civil War they have waited for this emancipation and for the free opportunities it will bring with it . It has been reserved for us to give it to them . Some fell in love , indeed , with the slothful security of their dependence upon the Government some took advantage of the shelter of the nursery to set up a mimic mastery of their own within its walls . Now both the tonic and the discipline of liberty and maturity are to ensue . There will be some readjustments of purpose and point of view . There will follow a period of expansion and new enterprise , freshly conceived . It is for us to determine now whether it shall be rapid and facile and of easy accomplishment . This it cannot be unless the resourceful business men who are to deal with the new circumstances are to have at hand and ready for use the instrumentalities and conveniences of free enterprise which independent men need when acting on their own initiative . It is not enough to strike the shackles from business . The duty of statesmanship is not negative merely . It is constructive also . We must show that we understand what business needs and that we know how to supply it . No man , however casual and superficial his observation of the conditions now prevailing in the country , can fail to see that one of the chief things business needs now , and will need increasingly as it gains in scope and vigor in the years immediately ahead of us , is the proper means by which readily to vitalize its credit , corporate and individual , and its originative brains . What will it profit us to be free if we are not to have the best and most accessible instrumentalities of commerce and enterprise What will it profit us to be quit of one kind of monopoly if we are to remain in the grip of another and more effective kind How are we to gain and keep the confidence of the business community unless we show that we know how both to aid and to protect it What shall we say if we make fresh enterprise necessary and also make it very difficult by leaving all else except the tariff just as we found it The tyrannies of business , big and little , lie within the field of credit . We know that . Shall we not act upon the knowledge Do we not know how to act upon it If a man cannot make his assets available at pleasure , his assets of capacity and character and resource , what satisfaction is it to him to see opportunity beckoning to him on every hand , when others have the keys of credit in their pockets and treat them as all but their own private possession It is perfectly clear that it is our duty to supply the new banking and currency system the country needs , and it will need it immediately more than it has ever needed it before . The only question is , When shall we supply it now , or later , after the demands shall have become reproaches that we were so dull and so slow Shall we hasten to change the tariff laws and then be laggards about making it possible and easy for the country to take advantage of the change There can be only one answer to that question . We must act now , at whatever sacrifice to ourselves . It is a duty which the circumstances forbid us to postpone . I should be recreant to my deepest convictions of public obligation did I not press it upon you with solemn and urgent insistence . The principles upon which we should act are also clear . The country has sought and seen its path in this matter within the last few years sees it more clearly now than it ever saw it before much more clearly than when the last legislative proposals on the subject were made . We must have a currency , not rigid as now , but readily , elastically responsive to sound credit , the expanding and contracting credits of everyday transactions , the normal ebb and flow of personal and corporate dealings . Our banking laws must mobilize reserves must not permit the concentration anywhere in a few hands of the monetary resources of the country or their use for speculative purposes in such volume as to hinder or impede or stand in the way of other more legitimate , more fruitful uses . And the control of the system of banking and of issue which our new laws are to set up must be public , not private , must be vested in the Government itself , so that the banks may be the instruments , not the masters , of business and of individual enterprise and initiative . The committees of the Congress to which legislation of this character is referred have devoted careful and dispassionate study to the means of accomplishing these objects . They have honored me by consulting me . They are ready to suggest action . I have come to you , as the head of the Government and the responsible leader of the party in power , to urge action now , while there is time to serve the country deliberately and as we should , in a clear air of common counsel . I appeal to you with a deep conviction of duty . I believe that you share this conviction . I therefore appeal to you with confidence . I am at your service without reserve to play my part in any way you may call upon me to play it in this great enterprise of exigent reform which it will dignify and distinguish us to perform and discredit us to neglect .<speech_sep>Ladies and Gentlemen I have not come here to day with a prepared address . The committee in charge of the exercises of the day have graciously excused me on the grounds of public obligations from preparing such an address , but I will not deny myself the privilege of joining with you in an expression of gratitude and admiration for the men who perished for the sake of the Union . They do not need our praise . They do not need that our admiration should sustain them . There is no immortality that is safer than theirs . We come not for their sakes but for our own , in order that we may drink at the same springs of inspiration from which they themselves selves drank . A peculiar privilege came to the men who fought for the Union . There is no other civil war in history , ladies and gentlemen , the stings of which were removed before the men who did the fighting passed from the stage of life . So that we owe these men something more than a legal reestablishment of the Union . We owe them the spiritual reestablishment of the Union as well for they not only reunited States , they reunited the spirits of men . That is their unique achievement , unexampled anywhere else in the annals of mankind , that the very men whom they overcame in battle join in praise and gratitude that the Union was saved . There is something peculiarly beautiful and peculiarly touching about that . Whenever a man who is still trying to devote himself to the service of the Nation comes into a presence like this , or into a place like this , his spirit must be peculiarly moved . A mandate is laid upon him which seems to speak from the very graves themselves . Those who serve this Nation , whether in peace or in war , should serve it without thought of themselves . I can never speak in praise of war , ladies and gentlemen you would not desire me to do so . But there is this peculiar distinction belonging to the soldier , that he goes into an enterprise out of which he himself cannot get anything at all . He is giving everything that he hath , even his life , in order that others may live , not in order that he himself may obtain gain and prosperity . And just so soon as the tasks of peace are performed in the same spirit of self sacrifice and devotion , peace societies will not be necessary . The very organization and spirit of society will be a guaranty of peace . Therefore this peculiar thing comes about , that we can stand here and praise the memory of these soldiers in the interest of peace . They set us the example of self sacrifice , which if followed in peace will make it unnecessary that men should follow war any more . We are reputed to be somewhat careless in our discrimination between words in the use of the English language , and yet it is interesting to note that there are some words about which we are very careful . We bestow the adjective great somewhat indiscriminately . A man who has made conquest of his fellow men for his own gain may display such genius in war , such uncommon qualities of organization and leadership that we may call him great , but there is a word which we reserve for men of another kind and about which we are very careful that is the word noble . We never call a man noble who serves only himself and if you will look about through all the nations of the world upon the statues that men have erected upon the inscribed tablets where they have wished to keep alive the memory of the citizens whom they desire most to honor you will find that almost without exception they have erected the statue to those who had a splendid surplus of energy and devotion to spend upon their fellow men . Nobility exists in America without patent . We have no House of Lords , but we have a house of fame to which we elevate those who are the noble men of our race , who , forgetful of themselves , study and serve the public interest , who have the courage to face any number and any kind of adversary , to speak what in their hearts they believe to be the truth . We admire physical courage , but we admire above all things else moral courage . I believe that soldiers will bear me out in saying that both come in time of battle . I take it that the moral courage comes in going into the battle , and the physical courage in staying in . There are battles which are just as hard to go into and just as hard to stay in as the battles of arms , and if the man will but stay and think never of himself there will come a time of grateful recollection when men will speak of him not only with admiration but with that which goes deeper , with affection and with reverence . So that this flag calls upon us daily for service , and the more quiet and self denying the service the greater the glory of the flag . We are dedicated to freedom , and that freedom means the freedom of the human spirit . All free spirits ought to congregate on an occasion like this to do homage to the greatness of America as illustrated by the greatness of her sons . It has been a privilege , ladies and gentlemen , to come and say these simple words , which I am sure are merely putting your thought into language . I thank you for the opportunity to lay this little wreath of mine upon these consecrated graves .<speech_sep>
