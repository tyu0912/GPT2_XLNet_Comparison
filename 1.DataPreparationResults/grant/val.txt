To the Senate and House of Representatives In submitting my seventh annual message to Congress , in this centennial year of our national existence as a free and independent people , it affords me great pleasure to recur to the advancement that has been made from the time of the colonies , one hundred years ago . We were then a people numbering only 3 , 000 , 000 . Now we number more than 40 , 000 , 000 . Then industries were confined almost exclusively to the tillage of the soil . Now manufactories absorb much of the labor of the country . Our liberties remain unimpaired the bondmen have been freed from slavery we have become possessed of the respect , if not the friendship , of all civilized nations . Our progress has been great in all the arts in science , agriculture , commerce , navigation , mining , mechanics , law , medicine , etc . and in general education the progress is likewise encouraging . Our thirteen States have become thirty eight , including Colorado which has taken the initiatory steps to become a State , and eight Territories , including the Indian Territory and Alaska , and excluding Colorado , making a territory extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific . On the south we have extended to the Gulf of Mexico , and in the west from the Mississippi to the Pacific . One hundred years ago the cotton gin , the steamship , the railroad , the telegraph , the reaping , sewing , and modern printing machines , and numerous other inventions of scarcely less value to our business and happiness were entirely unknown . In 1776 manufactories scarcely existed even in name in all this vast territory . In 1870 more than 2 , 000 , 000 persons were employed in manufactories , producing more than 2 , 100 , 000 , 000 of products in amount annually , nearly equal to our national debt . From nearly the whole of the population of 1776 being engaged in the one occupation of agriculture , in 1870 so numerous and diversified had become the occupation of our people that less than 6 , 000 , 000 out of more than 40 , 000 , 000 were so engaged . The extraordinary effect produced in our country by a resort to diversified occupations has built a market for the products of fertile lands distant from the seaboard and the markets of the world . The American system of locating various and extensive manufactories next to the plow and the pasture , and adding connecting railroads and steamboats , has produced in our distant interior country a result noticeable by the intelligent portions all all commercial nations . The ingenuity and skill of American mechanics have been demonstrated at home and abroad in a manner most flattering to their pride . But for the extraordinary genius and ability of our mechanics , the achievements of our agriculturists , manufacturers , and transporters throughout the country would have been impossible of attainment . The progress of the miner has also been great . Of coal our production has small now many millions of tons are mined annually . So with iron , which formed scarcely an appreciable part of our products half a century ago , we now produce more than the world consumed at the beginning of our national existence . Lead , zinc , and copper , from being articles of import , we may expect to be large exporters of in the near future . The development of gold and silver mines in the United States and Territories has not only been remarkable , but has had a large influence upon the business of all commercial nations . Our merchants in the last hundred years have had a success and have established a reputation for enterprise , sagacity , progress , and integrity unsurpassed by peoples of older nationalities . This good name is not confined to their homes , but goes out upon every sea and into every port where commerce enters . With equal pride we can point to our progress in all of the learned professions . As we are now about to enter upon our second centennial commenting our manhood as a nation it is well to look back upon the past and study what will be best to preserve and advance our future greatness From the fall of Adam for his transgression to the present day no nation has ever been free from threatened danger to its prosperity and happiness . We should look to the dangers threatening us , and remedy them so far as lies in our power . We are a republic whereof one man is as good as another before the law . Under such a form of government it is of the greatest importance that all should be possessed of education and intelligence enough to cast a vote with a right understanding of its meaning . A large association of ignorant men can not for any considerable period oppose a successful resistance to tyranny and oppression from the educated few , but will inevitably sink into acquiescence to the will of intelligence , whether directed by the demagogue or by priestcraft . Hence the education of the masses becomes of the first necessity for the preservation of our institutions . They are worth preserving , because they have secured the greatest good to the greatest proportion of the population of any form of government yet devised . All other forms of government approach it just in proportion to the general diffusion of education and independence of thought and action . As the primary step , therefore , to our advancement in all that has marked our progress in the past century , I suggest for your earnest consideration , and most earnestly recommend it , that a constitutional amendment be submitted to the legislatures of the several States for ratification , making it the duty of each of the several States to establish and forever maintain free public schools adequate to the education of all the children in the rudimentary branches within their respective limits , irrespective of sex , color , birthplace , or religions forbidding the teaching in said schools of religious , atheistic , or pagan tenets and prohibiting the granting of any school funds or school taxes , or any part thereof , either by legislative , municipal , or other authority , for the benefit or in aid , directly or indirectly , of any religious sect or denomination , or in aid or for the benefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatever . In connection with this important question I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil that , if permitted to continue , will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the nineteenth century . It is the accumulation of vast amounts of untaxed church property . In 1850 , I believe , the church property of the United States which paid no tax , municipal or State , amounted to about 83 , 000 , 000 . In 1860 the amount had doubled in 1875 it is about 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 . By 1900 , without check , it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding 3 , 000 , 000 , 000 . So vast a sum , receiving all the protection and benefits of Government without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same , will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes . In a growing country , where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United States , there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations , religious or otherwise , if allowed to retain real estate without taxation . The contemplation of so vast a property as here alluded to , without taxation , may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority and through blood . I would suggest the taxation of all property equally , whether church or corporation , exempting only the last resting place of the dead and possibly , with proper restrictions , church edifices . Our relations with most of the foreign powers continue on a satisfactory and friendly footing . Increased intercourse , the extension of commerce , and the cultivation of mutual interests have steadily improved our relations with the large majority of the powers of the world , rendering practicable the peaceful solution of questions which from time to time necessarily arise , leaving few which demand extended or particular notice . The correspondence of the Department of State with our diplomatic representatives abroad is transmitted herewith . I am happy to announce the passage of an act by the General Cortes of Portugal , proclaimed since the adjournment of Congress , for the abolition of servitude in the Portuguese colonies . It is to be hoped that such legislation may be another step toward the great consummation to be reached , when no man shall be permitted , directly or indirectly , under any guise , excuse , or form of law , to hold his fellow man in bondage . I am of opinion also that it is the duty of the United States , as contributing toward that end , and required by the spirit of the age in which we live , to provide by suitable legislation that no citizen of the United States shall hold slaves as property in any other country or be interested therein . Chile has made reparation in the case of the whale ship Good Return , seized without sufficient cause upward of forty years ago . Though she had hitherto denied her accountability , the denial was never acquiesced in by this Government , and the justice of the claim has been so earnestly contended for that it has been gratifying that she should have at last acknowledged it . The arbitrator in the case of the United States steamer Montijo , for the seizure and detention of which the Government of the United States of Colombia was held accountable , has decided in favor of the claim . This decision has settled a question which had been pending for several years , and which , while it continued open , might more or less disturb the good understanding which it is desirable should be maintained between the two Republics . A reciprocity treaty with the King of the Hawaiian Islands was concluded some months since . As it contains a stipulation that it shall not take effect until Congress shall enact the proper legislation for that purpose , copies of the instrument are herewith submitted , in order that , if such should be the pleasure of Congress , the necessary legislation upon the subject may be adopted . In March last an arrangement was made , through Cushing , our minister in Madrid , with the Spanish Government for the payment by the latter to the United States of the sum of 80 , 000 in coin , for the purpose of the relief of the families or persons of the ship s company and certain passengers of the Virginius . This sum was to have been paid in three installments at two months each . It is due to the Spanish Government that I should state that the payments were fully and spontaneously anticipated by that Government , and that the whole amount was paid within but a few days more than two months from the date of the agreement , a copy of which is herewith transmitted . In pursuance of the terms of the adjustment , I have directed the distribution of the amount among the parties entitled thereto , including the ship s company and such of the passengers as were American citizens . Payments are made accordingly , on the application by the parties entitled thereto . The past year has furnished no evidence of an approaching termination of the ruinous conflict which has been raging for seven years in the neighboring island of Cuba . The same disregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of humanity which has heretofore called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom has continued to blacken the sad scene . Desolation , ruin , and pillage are pervading the rich fields of one of the most fertile and productive regions of the earth , and the incendiary s torch , firing plantations and valuable factories and buildings , is the agent marking the alternate advance or retreat of contending parties . The protracted continuance of this strife seriously affects the interests of all commercial nations , but those of the United States more than others , by reason of close proximity , its larger trade and intercourse with Cuba , and the frequent and intimate personal and social relations which have grown up between its citizens and those of the island . Moreover , the property of our citizens in Cuba is large , and is rendered insecure and depreciated in value and in capacity of production by the continuance of the strife and the unnatural mode of its conduct . The same is true , differing only in degree , with respect to the interests and people of other nations and the absence of any reasonable assurance of a near termination of the conflict must of necessity soon compel the States thus suffering to consider what the interests of their own people and their duty toward themselves may demand . I have hoped that Spain would be enabled to establish peace in her colony , to afford security to the property and the interests of our citizens , and allow legitimate scope to trade and commerce and the natural productions of the island . Because of this hope , and from an extreme reluctance to interfere in the most remote manner in the affairs of another and a friendly nation , especially of one whose sympathy and friendship in the struggling infancy of our own existence must ever be remembered with gratitude , I have patiently and anxiously waited the progress of events . Our own civil conflict is too recent for us not to consider the difficulties which surround a government distracted by a dynastic rebellion at home at the same time that it has to cope with a separate insurrection in a distant colony . But whatever causes may have produced the situation which so grievously affects our interests , it exists , with all its attendant evils operating directly upon this country and its people . Thus far all the efforts of Spain have proved abortive , and time has marked no improvement in the situation . The armed bands of either side now occupy nearly the same ground as in the past , with the difference , from time to time , of more lives sacrificed , more property destroyed , and wider extents of fertile and productive fields and more and more of valuable property constantly wantonly sacrificed to the incendiary s torch . In contests of this nature , where a considerable body of people who have attempted to free themselves of the control of the superior government have reached such point in occupation of territory , in power , and in general organization as to constitute in fact a body politic having a government in substance as well as in name possessed of the elements of stability and equipped with the machinery for the administration of internal policy and the execution of its laws prepared and able to administer justice at home , as well as in its dealings with other powers , it is within the province of those other powers to recognize its existence as a new and independent nation . In such cases other nations simply deal with an actually existing condition of things , and recognize as one of the powers of the earth that body politic which , possessing the necessary elements , has in fact become a new power . In a word , the creation of a new state is a fact . To establish the condition of things essential to the recognition of this fact there must be a people occupying a known territory , united under some known and defined form of government , acknowledged by those subject thereto , in which the functions of government are administered by usual methods , competent to mete out justice to citizens and strangers , to afford remedies for public and for private wrongs , and able to assume the correlative international obligations and capable of performing the corresponding international duties resulting from its acquisition of the rights of sovereignty . A power should exist complete in its organization , ready to take and able to maintain its place among the nations of the earth . While conscious that the insurrection in Cuba has shown a strength and endurance which make it at least doubtful whether it be in the power of Spain to subdue it , it seems unquestionable that no such civil organization exists which may be recognized as an independent government capable of performing its international obligations and entitled to be treated as one of the powers of the earth . A recognition under such circumstances would be inconsistent with the facts , and would compel the power granting it soon to support by force the government to which it had really given its only claim of existence . In my judgment the United States should adhere to the policy and the principles which have heretofore been its sure and safe guides in like contests between revolted colonies and their mother country , and , acting only upon the clearest evidence , should avoid any possibility of suspicion or of imputation . A recognition of the independence of Cuba being , in my opinion , impracticable and indefensible , the question which next presents itself is that of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the contest . In a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question , and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba , dreadful and devastating as were its incidents , did not rise to the fearful dignity of war . Regarding it now , after this lapse of time , I am unable to see that any notable success or any marked or real advance on the part of the insurgents has essentially changed the character of the contest . It has acquired greater age , but not greater or more formidable proportions . It is possible that the acts of foreign powers , and even acts of Spain herself , of this very nature , might be pointed to in defense of such recognition . But now , as in its past history , the United States should carefully avoid the false lights which might lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of questionable propriety , and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule , which has been its guide , of doing only that which is right and honest and of good report . The question of according or of withholding rights of belligerency must be judged in every case in view of the particular attending facts . Unless justified by necessity , it is always , and justly , regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion . It is necessary , and it is required , when the interests and rights of another government or of its people are so far affected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of its relations to the parties thereto . But this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the sense of international law as war . Belligerence , too , is a fact . The mere existence of contending armed bodies and their occasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to . Applying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by publicists and writers on international law , and which have been observed by nations of dignity , honesty , and power when free from sensitive or selfish and unworthy motives , I fail to find in the insurrection the existence of such a substantial political organization , real , palpable , and manifest to the world , having the forms and capable of the ordinary functions of government toward its own people and to other states , with courts for the administration of justice , with a local habitation , possessing such organization of force , such material , such occupation of territory , as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footing of war , to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it . The contest , moreover , is solely on land the insurrection has not possessed itself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag , nor has it any means of communication with foreign powers except through the military lines of its adversaries . No apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels , both commercial and national , and upon the consular officers of other powers calls for the definition of their relations to the parties to the contest . Considered as a question of expediency , I regard the accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature as I regard it to be , at present , indefensible as a measure of right . Such recognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow from it difficult and complicated duties , and requires the exaction from the contending parties of the strict observance of their rights and obligations it confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels of both parties it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of war , which now may be transported freely and without interruption in the vessels of the United States , to detention and to possible seizure it would give rise to countless vexatious questions , would release the parent Government from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents , and would invest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas , a very large part of which , in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and between all of them and the States on the Pacific , passes through the waters which wash the shores of Cuba . The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail to lead , if not to abuses , certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful relations of the two States . There can be little doubt to what result such supervision would before long draw this nation . It would be unworthy of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection . Apart from any question of theoretical right , I am satisfied that while the accordance of belligerent rights to the insurgents in Cuba might give them a hope and an inducement to protract the struggle , it would be but a delusive hope , and would not remove the evils which this Government and its people are experiencing , but would draw the United States into complications which it has waited long and already suffered much to avoid . The recognition of independence or of belligerency being thus , in my judgment , equally inadmissible , it remains to consider what course shall be adopted should the conflict not soon be brought to an end by acts of the parties themselves , and should the evils which result therefrom , affecting all nations , and particularly the United States , continue . In such event I am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to assume the responsibility which devolves upon them , and to seriously consider the only remaining measures possible mediation and intervention , Owing , perhaps , to the large expanse of water separating the island from the peninsula , the want of harmony and of personal sympathy between the inhabitants of the colony and those sent thither to rule them , and want of adaptation of the ancient colonial system of Europe to the present times and to the ideas which the events of the past century have developed , the contending parties appear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence to suggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assume the part of peacemaker . In this view in the earlier days of the contest the good offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good faith , without any selfish purpose , in the interest of humanity and in sincere friendship for both parties , but were at the time declined by Spain , with the declaration , nevertheless , that at a future time they would be indispensable . No intimation has been received that in the opinion of Spain that time has been reached . And yet the strife continues , with all its dread horrors and all its injuries to the interests of the United States and of other nations . Each party seems quite capable of working great injury and damage to the other , as well as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of peace in the island but they seem incapable of reaching any adjustment , and both have thus far failed of achieving any success whereby one party shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other . Under these circumstances the agency of others , either by mediation or by intervention , seems to be the only alternative which must , sooner or later , be invoked for the termination of the strife . At the same time , while thus impressed I do not at this time recommend the adoption of any measure of intervention . I shall be ready at all times , and as the equal friend of both parties , to respond to a suggestion that the good offices of the United States will be acceptable to aid in bringing about a peace honorable to both . It is due to Spain , so far as this Government is concerned , that the agency of a third power , to which I have adverted , shall be adopted only as a last expedient . Had it been the desire of the United States to interfere in the affairs of Cuba , repeated opportunities for so doing have been presented within the last few years but we have remained passive , and have performed our whole duty and all international obligations to Spain with friendship , fairness , and fidelity , and with a spirit of patience and forbearance which negatives every possible suggestion of desire to interfere or to add to the difficulties with which she has been surrounded . The Government of Spain has recently submitted to our minister at Madrid certain proposals which it is hoped may be found to be the basis , if not the actual submission , of terms to meet the requirements of the particular griefs of which this Government has felt itself entitled to complain . These proposals have not yet reached me in their full text . On their arrival they will be taken into careful examination , and may , I hope , lead to a satisfactory adjustment of the questions to which they refer and remove the possibility of future occurrences such as have given rise to our just complaints . It is understood also that renewed efforts are being made to introduce reforms in the internal administration of the island . Persuaded , however , that a proper regard for the interests of the United States and of its citizens entitles it to relief from the strain to which it has been subjected by the difficulties of the questions and the wrongs and losses which arise from the contest in Cuba , and that the interests of humanity itself demand the cessation of the strife before the whole island shall be laid waste and larger sacrifices of life be made , I shall feel it my duty , should my hopes of a satisfactory adjustment and of the early restoration of peace and the removal of future causes of complaint be , unhappily , disappointed , to make a further communication to Congress at some period not far remote , and during the present session , recommending what may then seem to me to be necessary . The free zone , so called , several years since established by the Mexican Government in certain of the States of that Republic adjacent to our frontier , remains in full operation . It has always been materially injurious to honest traffic , for it operates as an incentive to traders in Mexico to supply without customs charges the wants of inhabitants on this side of the line , and prevents the same wants from being supplied by merchants of the United States , thereby to a considerable extent defrauding our revenue and checking honest commercial enterprise . Depredations by armed bands from Mexico on the people of Texas near the frontier continue . Though the main object of these incursions is robbery , they frequently result in the murder of unarmed and peaceably disposed persons , and in some instances even the United States post offices and mail communications have been attacked . Renewed remonstrances upon this subject have been addressed to the Mexican Government , but without much apparent effect . The military force of this Government disposable for service in that quarter is quite inadequate to effectually guard the line , even at those points where the incursions are usually made . An experiment of an armed vessel on the Rio Grande for that purpose is on trial , and it is hoped that , if not thwarted by the shallowness of the river and other natural obstacles , it may materially contribute to the protection of the herdsmen of Texas . The proceedings of the joint commission under the convention between the United States and Mexico of the 4th of July , 1868 , on the subject of claims , will soon be brought to a close . The result of those proceedings will then be communicated to Congress . I am happy to announce that the Government of Venezuela has , upon further consideration , practically abandoned its objection to pay to the United States that share of its revenue which some years since it allotted toward the extinguishment of the claims of foreigners generally . In thus reconsidering its determination that Government has shown a just sense of self respect which can not fail to reflect credit upon it in the eyes of all disinterested persons elsewhere . It is to be regretted , however , that its payments on account of claims of citizens of the United States are still so meager in amount , and that the stipulations of the treaty in regard to the sums to be paid and the periods when those payments were to take place should have been so signally disregarded . Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium , and of conventions with the Mexican Republic for the further extension of the joint commission respecting claims with the Hawaiian Islands for commercial reciprocity , and with the Ottoman Empire for extradition all of which have been duly proclaimed . The Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims has prosecuted its important duties very assiduously and very satisfactorily . It convened and was organized on the 22d day of July , 1874 , and by the terms of the act under which it was created was to exist for one year from that date . The act provided , however , that should it be found impracticable to complete the work of the court before the expiration of the year the President might by proclamation extend the time of its duration to a period not more than six months beyond the expiration of the one year . Having received satisfactory evidence that it would be impracticable to complete the work within the time originally fixed , I issued a proclamation a copy of which is presented herewith extending the time of duration of the court for a period of six months from and after the 22d day of July last . A report made through the clerk of the court communicated herewith shows the condition of the calendar on the 1st of November last and the large amount of work which has been accomplished . One thousand three hundred and eighty two claims have been presented , of which 682 had been disposed of at the date of the report . I am informed that 170 cases were decided during the month of November . Arguments are being made and decisions given in the remaining cases with all the dispatch consistent with the proper consideration of the questions submitted . Many of these claims are in behalf of mariners , or depend on the evidence of mariners , whose absence has delayed the taking or the return of the necessary evidence . It is represented to me that it will be impracticable for the court to finally dispose of all the cases before it within the present limit of its duration . Justice to the parties claimant , who have been at large expense in preparing their claims and obtaining the evidence in their support , suggests a short extension , to enable the court to dispose of all of the claims which have been presented . I recommend the legislation which may be deemed proper to enable the court to complete the work before it . I recommend that some suitable provision be made , by the creation of a special court or by conferring the necessary jurisdiction upon some appropriate tribunal , for the consideration and determination of the claims of aliens against the Government of the United States which have arisen within some reasonable limitation of time , or which may hereafter arise , excluding all claims barred by treaty provisions or otherwise . It has been found impossible to give proper consideration to these claims by the Executive Departments of the Government . Such a tribunal would afford an opportunity to aliens other than British subjects to present their claims on account of acts committed against their persons or property during the rebellion , as also to those subjects of Great Britain whose claims , having arisen subsequent to the 9th day of April , 1865 , could not be presented to the late commission organized pursuant to the provisions of the treaty of Washington . The electric telegraph has become an essential and indispensable agent in the transmission of business and social messages . Its operation on land , and within the limit of particular states , is necessarily under the control of the jurisdiction within which it operates . The lines on the high seas , however , are not subject to the particular control of any one government . In 1869 a concession was granted by the French Government to a company which proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to the United States . At that time there was a telegraphic connection between the United States and the continent of Europe through the possessions of Great Britain at either end of the line , under the control of an association which had , at large outlay of capital and at great risk , demonstrated the practicability of maintaining such means of communication . The cost of correspondence by this agency was great , possibly not too large at the time for a proper remuneration for so hazardous and so costly an enterprise . It was , however , a heavy charge upon a means of communication which the progress in the social and commercial intercourse of the world found to be a necessity , and the obtaining of this French concession showed that other capital than that already invested was ready to enter into competition , with assurance of adequate return for their outlay . Impressed with the conviction that the interests , not only of the people of the United States , but of the world at large , demanded , or would demand , the multiplication of such means of communication between separated continents , I was desirous that the proposed connection should be made but certain provisions of this concession were deemed by me to be objectionable , particularly one which gave for a long term of years the exclusive right of telegraphic communication by submarine cable between the shores of France and the United States . I could not concede that any power should claim the right to land a cable on the shores of the United States and at the same time deny to the United States , or to its citizens or grantees , an equal fight to land a cable on its shores . The right to control the conditions for the laying of a cable within the jurisdictional waters of the United States , to connect our shores with those of any foreign state , pertains exclusively to the Government of the United States , under such limitations and conditions as Congress may impose . In the absence of legislation by Congress I was unwilling , on the one hand , to yield to a foreign state the right to say that its grantees might land on our shores while it denied a similar right to our people to land on its shores , and , on the other hand , I was reluctant to deny to the great interests of the world and of civilization the facilities of such communication as were proposed . I therefore withheld any resistance to the landing of the cable on condition that the offensive monopoly feature of the concession be abandoned , and that the right of any cable which may be established by authority of this Government to land upon French territory and to connect with French land lines and enjoy all the necessary facilities or privileges incident to the use thereof upon as favorable terms as any other company be conceded . As the result thereof the company in question renounced the exclusive privilege , and the representative of France was informed that , understanding this relinquishment to be construed as granting the entire reciprocity and equal facilities which had been demanded , the opposition to the landing of the cable was withdrawn . The cable , under this French concession , was landed in the month of July , 1869 , and has been an efficient and valuable agent of communication between this country and the other continent . It soon passed under the control , however , of those who had the management of the cable connecting Great Britain with this continent , and thus whatever benefit to the public might have ensued from competition between the two lines was lost , leaving only the greater facilities of an additional line and the additional security in case of accident to one of them . But these increased facilities and this additional security , together with the control of the combined capital of the two companies , gave also greater power to prevent the future construction of other lines and to limit the control of telegraphic communication between the two continents to those possessing the lines already laid . Within a few months past a cable has been laid , known as the United States Direct Cable Company , connecting the United States directly with Great Britain . As soon as this cable was reported to be laid and in working order the rates of the then existing consolidated companies were greatly reduced . Soon , however , a break was announced in this new cable , and immediately the rates of the other line , which had been reduced , were again raised . This cable being now repaired , the rates appear not to be reduced by either line from those formerly charged by the consolidated companies . There is reason to believe that large amounts of capital , both at home and abroad , are ready to seek profitable investment in the advancement of this useful and most civilizing means of intercourse and correspondence . They await , however , the assurance of the means and conditions on which they may safely be made tributary to the general good . As these cable telegraph lines connect separate states , there are questions as to their organization and control which probably can be best , if not solely , settled by conventions between the respective states . In the absence , however , of international conventions on the subject , municipal legislation may secure many points which appear to me important , if not indispensable for the protection of the public against the extortions which may result from a monopoly of the right of operating cable telegrams or from a combination between several lines No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United States under the concession from another power which does not admit the right of any other line or lines , formed in the United States , to land and freely connect with and operate through its land lines . INo line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United States which is not , by treaty stipulation with the government from whose shores it proceeds , or by prohibition in its charter , or otherwise to the satisfaction of this Government , prohibited from consolidating or amalgamating with any other cable telegraph line , or combining therewith for the purpose of regulating and maintaining the cost of telegraphing . IIAll lines should be bound to give precedence in the transmission of the official messages of the governments of the two countries between which it may be laid . IA power should be reserved to the two governments , either conjointly or to each , as regards the messages dispatched from its shores , to fix a limit to the charges to be demanded for the transmission of messages . I present this subject to the earnest consideration of Congress . In the meantime , and unless Congress otherwise direct , I shall not oppose the landing of any telegraphic cable which complies with and assents to the points above enumerated , but will feel it my duty to prevent the landing of any which does not conform to the first and second points as stated , and which will not stipulate to concede to this Government the precedence in the transmission of its official messages and will not enter into a satisfactory arrangement with regard to its charges . Among the pressing and important subjects to which , in my opinion , the attention of Congress should be directed are those relating to fraudulent naturalization and expatriation . The United States , with great liberality , offers its citizenship to all who in good faith comply with the requirements of law . These requirements are as simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant as the high privilege to which he is admitted can or should permit . I do not propose any additional requirements to those which the law now demands but the very simplicity and the want of unnecessary formality in our law have made fraudulent naturalization not infrequent , to the discredit and injury of all honest citizens , whether native or naturalized . Cases of this character are continually being brought to the notice of the Government by our representatives abroad , and also those of persons resident in other countries , most frequently those who , if they have remained in this country long enough to entitle them to become naturalized , have generally not much overpassed that period , and have returned to the country of their origin , where they reside , avoiding all duties to the United States by their absence , and claiming to be exempt from all duties to the country of their nativity and of their residence by reason of their alleged naturalization . It is due to this Government itself and to the great mass of the naturalized citizens who entirely , both in name and in fact , become citizens of the United States that the high privilege of citizenship of the United States should not be held by fraud or in derogation of the laws and of the good name of every honest citizen . On many occasions it has been brought to the knowledge of the Government that certificates of naturalization are held and protection or interference claimed by parties who admit that not only they were not within the United States at the time of the pretended naturalization , but that they have never resided in the United States in others the certificate and record of the court show on their face that the person claiming to be naturalized had not resided the required time in the United States in others it is admitted upon examination that the requirements of law have not been complied with in some eases , even , such certificates have been matter of purchase . These are not isolated eases , arising at rare intervals , but of common occurrence , and which are reported from all quarters of the globe . Such occurrences can not , and do not , fail to reflect upon the Government and injure all honest citizens . Such a fraud being discovered , however , there is no practicable means within the control of the Government by which the record of naturalization can be vacated and should the certificate be taken up , as it usually is , by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the Government to whom it may have been presented , there is nothing to prevent the person claiming to have been naturalized from obtaining a new certificate from the court in place of that which has been taken from him . The evil has become so great and of such frequent occurrence that I can not too earnestly recommend that some effective measures be adopted to provide a proper remedy and means for the vacating of any record thus fraudulently made , and of punishing the guilty parties to the transaction . In this connection I refer also to the question of expatriation and the election of nationality . The United States was foremost in upholding the right of expatriation , and was principally instrumental in overthrowing the doctrine of perpetual allegiance . Congress has declared the right of expatriation to be a natural and inherent right of all people but while many other nations have enacted laws providing what formalities shall be necessary to work a change of allegiance , the United States has enacted no provisions of law and has in no respect marked out how and when expatriation may be accomplished by its citizens . Instances are brought to the attention of the Government where citizens of the United States , either naturalized or native born , have formally become citizens or subjects of foreign powers , but who , nevertheless , in the absence of any provisions of legislation on this question , when involved in difficulties or when it seems to be their interest , claim to be citizens of the United States and demand the intervention of a Government which they have long since abandoned and to which for years they have rendered no service nor held themselves in any way amenable . In other cases naturalized citizens , immediately after naturalization , have returned to their native country have become engaged in business have accepted offices or pursuits inconsistent with American citizenship , and evidence no intent to return to the United States until called upon to discharge some duty to the country where they are residing , when at once they assert their citizenship and call upon the representatives of the Government to aid them in their unjust pretensions . It is but justice to all bona fide citizens that no doubt should exist on such questions , and that Congress should determine by enactment of law how expatriation may be accomplished and change of citizenship be established . I also invite your attention to the necessity of regulating by law the status of American women who may marry foreigners , and of defining more fully that of children born in a foreign country of American parents who may reside abroad and also of some further provision regulating or giving legal effect to marriages of American citizens contracted in foreign countries . The correspondence submitted herewith shows a few of the constantly occurring questions on these points presented to the consideration of the Government . There are few subjects to engage the attention of Congress on which more delicate relations or more important interests are dependent . In the month of July last the building erected for the Department of State was taken possession of and occupied by that Department . I am happy to announce that the archives and valuable papers of the Government in the custody of that Department are now safely deposited and properly cared for . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts from customs for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1874 , to have been 163 , 103 , 833 . 69 , and for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1875 , to have been 157 , 267 , 722 . 35 , a decrease for the last fiscal year of 5 , 936 , 111 . 34 . Receipts from internal revenue for the year ending the 30th of June , 1874 , were 102 , 409 , 784 . 90 , and for the year ending June 30 , 1875 , 110 , 007 , 493 . 58 increase , 7 , 597 , 708 . 68 . The report also shows a complete history of the workings of the Department for the last year , and contains recommendations for reforms and for legislation which I concur in , but can not comment on so fully as I should like to do if space would permit , but will confine myself to a few suggestions which I look upon as vital to the best interests of the whole people coming within the purview of Treasury I mean specie resumption . Too much stress can not be laid upon this question , and I hope Congress may be induced , at the earliest day practicable , to insure the consummation of the act of the last Congress , at its last session , to bring about specie resumption on and after the 1st of January , 1879 , at furthest . It would be a great blessing if this could be consummated even at an earlier day . Nothing seems to me more certain than that a full , healthy , and permanent reaction can not take place in favor of the industries and financial welfare of the country until we return to a measure of values recognized throughout the civilized world . While we use a currency not equivalent to this standard the world s recognized standard , specie , becomes a commodity like the products of the soil , the surplus seeking a market wherever there is a demand for it . Under our present system we should want none , nor would we have any , were it not that customs dues must be paid in coin and because of the pledge to pay interest on the public debt in coin . The yield of precious metals would flow out for the purchase of foreign productions and the United States hewers of wood and drawers of water , because of wiser legislation on the subject of finance by the nations with whom we have dealings . I am not prepared to say that I can suggest the best legislation to secure the end most heartily recommended . It will be a source of great gratification to me to be able to approve any measure of Congress looking effectively toward securing resumption . Unlimited inflation would probably bring about specie payments more speedily than any legislation looking to redemption of the legal tenders in coin but it would be at the expense of honor . The legal tenders would have no value beyond settling present liabilities , or , properly speaking , repudiating them . They would buy nothing after debts were all settled . There are a few measures which seem to me important in this connection and which I commend to your earnest consideration A repeal of so much of the legal tender act as makes these notes receivable for debts contracted after a date to be fixed in the act itself , say not later than the 1st of January , 1877 . We should then have quotations at real values , not fictitious ones . Gold would no longer be at a premium , but currency at a discount . A healthy reaction would set in at once , and with it a desire to make the currency equal to what it purports to be . The merchants , manufacturers , and tradesmen of every calling could do business on a fair margin of profit , the money to be received having an unvarying value . Laborers and all classes who work for stipulated pay or salary would receive more for their income , because extra profits would no longer be charged by the capitalists to compensate for the risk of a downward fluctuation in the value of the currency . Second . That the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to redeem , say , not to exceed 2 , 000 , 000 monthly of legal tender notes , by issuing in their stead a long bond , bearing interest at the rate of 3 . 65 per cent per annum , of denominations ranging from 50 up to 1 , 000 each . This would in time reduce the legal tender notes to a volume that could be kept afloat without demanding redemption in large sums suddenly . Third . That additional power be given to the Secretary of the Treasury to accumulate gold for final redemption , either by increasing revenue , curtailing expenses , or both it is preferable to do both and I recommend that reduction of expenditures be made wherever it can be done without impairing Government obligations or crippling the due execution thereof . One measure for increasing the revenue and the only one I think of is the restoration of the duty on tea and coffee . These duties would add probably 18 , 000 , 000 to the present amount received from imports , and would in no way increase the prices paid for those articles by the consumers . These articles are the products of countries collecting revenue from exports , and as we , the largest consumers , reduce the duties they proportionately increase them . With this addition to the revenue , many duties now collected , and which give but an insignificant return for the cost of collection , might be remitted , and to the direct advantage of consumers at home . I would mention those articles which enter into manufactures of all sorts . All duty paid upon such articles goes directly to the cost of the article when manufactured here , and must be paid for by the consumers . These duties not only come from the consumers at home , but act as a protection to foreign manufacturers of the same completed articles in our own and distant markets . I will suggest or mention another subject bearing upon the problem of how to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to accumulate balances . It is to devise some better method of verifying claims against the Government than at present exists through the Court of Claims , especially those claims growing out of the late war . Nothing is more certain than that a very large percentage of the amounts passed and paid are either wholly fraudulent or are far in excess of the real losses sustained . The large amount of losses proven on good testimony according to existing laws , by affidavits of fictitious or unscrupulous persons to have been sustained on small farms and plantations are not only far beyond the possible yield of those places for any one year , but , as everyone knows who has had experience in tilling the soil and who has visited the scenes of these spoliations , are in many instances more than the individual claimants were ever worth , including their personal and real estate . The report of the Attorney General , which will be submitted to Congress at an early day , will contain a detailed history of awards made and of claim pending of the class here referred to . The report of the Secretary of War , accompanying this message , gives a detailed account of Army operations for the year just passed , expenses for maintenance , etc . , with recommendations for legislation to which I respectfully invite your attention . To some of these I invite special attention First . The necessity of making 300 , 000 of the appropriation for the Subsistence Department available before the beginning of the next fiscal year . Without this provision troops at points distant from supply production must either go without food or existing laws must be violated . It is not attended with cost to the Treasury . Second . His recommendation for the enactment of a system of annuities for the families of deceased officers by voluntary deductions from the monthly pay of officers . This again is not attended with burden upon the Treasury , and would for the future relieve much distress which every old army officer has witnessed in the past of officers dying suddenly or being killed , leaving families without even the means of reaching their friends , if fortunate enough to have friends to aid them . Third . The repeal of the law abolishing mileage , and a return to the old system . Fourth . The trial with torpedoes under the Corps of Engineers , and appropriation for the same . Should war ever occur between the United States and any maritime power , torpedoes will be among if not the most effective and cheapest auxiliary for the defense of harbors , and also in aggressive operations , that we can have . Hence it is advisable to learn by experiment their best construction and application , as well as effect . Fifth . A permanent organization for the Signal Service Corps . This service has now become a necessity of peace as well as war , under the advancement made by the present able management . Sixth . A renewal of the appropriation for compiling the official records of the war , etc . The condition of our Navy at this time is a subject of satisfaction . It does not contain , it is true , any of the powerful cruising ironclads which make so much of the maritime strength of some other nations , but neither our continental situation nor our foreign policy requires that we should have a large number of ships of this character , while this situation and the nature of our ports combine to make those of other nations little dangerous to us under any circumstances . Our Navy does contain , however , a considerable number of ironclads of the monitor class , which , though not properly cruisers , are powerful and effective for harbor defense and for operations near our own shores . Of these all the single turreted ones , fifteen in number , have been substantially rebuilt , their rotten wooden beams replaced with iron , their hulls strengthened , and their engines and machinery thoroughly repaired , so that they are now in the most efficient condition and ready for sea as soon as they can be manned and put in commission . The five double turreted ironclads belonging to our Navy , by far the most powerful of our ships for fighting purposes , are also in hand undergoing complete repairs , and could be ready for sea in periods varying from four to six months . With these completed according to the present design and our two iron torpedo boats now ready , our ironclad fleet will be , for the purposes of defense at home , equal to any force that can readily be brought against it . Of our wooden navy also cruisers of various sizes , to the number of about forty , including those now in commission , are in the Atlantic , and could be ready for duty as fast as men could be enlisted for those not already in commission . Of these , one third are in effect new ships , and though some of the remainder need considerable repairs to their boilers and machinery , they all are , or can readily be made , effective . This constitutes a fleet of more than fifty war ships , of which fifteen are ironclad , now in hand on the Atlantic coast . The Navy has been brought to this condition by a judicious and practical application of what could be spared from the current appropriations of the last few years and from that made to meet the possible emergency of two years ago . It has been done quietly , without proclamation or display , and though it has necessarily straitened the Department in its ordinary expenditure , and , as far as the ironclads are concerned , has added nothing to the cruising force of the Navy , yet the result is not the less satisfactory because it is to be found in a great increase of real rather than apparent force . The expenses incurred in the maintenance of an effective naval force in all its branches are necessarily large , but such force is essential to our position , relations , and character , and affects seriously the weight of our principles and policy throughout the whole sphere of national responsibilities . The estimates for the regular support of this branch of the service for the next year amount to a little less in the aggregate than those made for the current year but some additional appropriations are asked for objects not included in the ordinary maintenance of the Navy , but believed to be of pressing importance at this time . It would , in my opinion , be wise at once to afford sufficient means for the immediate completion of the five double turreted monitors now undergoing repairs , which must otherwise advance slowly , and only as money can be spared from current expenses . Supplemented by these , our Navy , armed with the destructive weapons of modern warfare , manned by our seamen , and in charge of our instructed officers , will present a force powerful for the home purposes of a responsible though peaceful nation . The report of the Postmaster General herewith transmitted gives a full history of the workings of the Department for the year just past . It will be observed that the deficiency to be supplied from the General Treasury is increased over the amount required for the preceding year . In a country so vast in area as the United States , with large portions sparsely settled , it must be expected that this important service will be more or less a burden upon the Treasury for many years to come . But there is no branch of the public service which interests the whole people more than that of cheap and rapid transmission of the mails to every inhabited part of our territory . Next to the free school , the post office is the great educator of the people , and it may well receive the support of the General Government . The subsidy of 150 , 000 per annum given to vessels of the United States for carrying the mails between New York and Rio de Janeiro having ceased on the 30th day of September last , we are without direct mail facilities with the South American States . This is greatly to be regretted , and I do not hesitate to recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract , and also that the service may be increased from monthly to semi monthly trips . The commercial advantages to be gained by a direct line of American steamers to the South American States will far outweigh the expense of the service . By act of Congress approved March 3 , 1875 , almost all matter , whether properly mail matter or not , may be sent any distance through the mails , in packages not exceeding 4 pounds in weight , for the sum of 16 cents per pound . So far as the transmission of real mail matter goes , this would seem entirely proper but I suggest that the law be so amended as to exclude from the mails merchandise of all descriptions , and limit this transportation to articles enumerated , and which may be classed as mail matter proper . The discovery of gold in the Black Hills , a portion of the Sioux Reservation , has had the effect to induce a large emigration of miners to that point . Thus far the effort to protect the treaty rights of the Indians to that section has been successful , but the next year will certainly witness a large increase of such emigration . The negotiations for the relinquishment of the gold fields having failed , it will be necessary for Congress to adopt some measures to relieve the embarrassment growing out of the causes named . The Secretary of the Interior suggests that the supplies now appropriated for the sustenance of that people , being no longer obligatory under the treaty of 1868 , but simply a gratuity , may be issued or withheld at his discretion . The condition of the Indian Territory , to which I have referred in several of my former annual messages , remains practically unchanged . The Secretary of the Interior has taken measures to obtain a full report of the condition of that Territory , and will make it the subject of a special report at an early day . It may then be necessary to make some further recommendation in regard to legislation for the government of that Territory . The steady growth and increase of the business of the Patent Office indicates in some measure the progress of the industrial activity of the country . The receipts of the office are in excess of its expenditures , and the office generally is in a prosperous and satisfactory condition . The report of the General Land Office shows that there were 2 , 459 , 601 acres less disposed of during this than during the last year . More than one half of this decrease was in lands disposed of under the homestead and timber culture laws . The cause of this decrease is supposed to be found in the grasshopper scourge and the droughts which prevailed so extensively in some of the frontier States and Territories during that time as to discourage and deter entries by actual settlers . The cash receipts were less by 690 , 322 . 23 than during the preceding year . The entire surveyed area of the public domain is 680 , 253 , 094 acres , of which 26 , 077 , 531 acres were surveyed during the past year , leaving 1 , 154 , 471 , 762 acres still unsurveyed . The report of the Commissioner presents many interesting suggestions in regard to the management and disposition of the public domain and the modification of existing laws , the apparent importance of which should insure for them the careful consideration of Congress . The number of pensioners still continues to decrease , the highest number having been reached during the year ending June 30 , 1873 . During the last year 11 , 557 names were added to the rolls , and 12 , 977 were dropped therefrom , showing a net decrease of 1 , 420 . But while the number of pensioners has decreased , the annual amount due on the pension rolls has increased 44 , 733 . 13 . This is caused by the greatly increased average rate of pensions , which , by the liberal legislation of Congress , has increased from 90 . 26 in 1872 to 103 . 91 in 1875 to each invalid pensioner , an increase in the average rate of 15 per cent in the three years . During the year ending June 30 , 1875 , there was paid on account of pensions , including the expenses of disbursement , 29 , 683 , 116 , being 910 , 632 less than was paid the preceding year . This reduction in amount of expenditures was produced by the decrease in the amount of arrearages due on allowed claims and on pensions the rate of which was increased by the legislation of the preceding session of Congress . At the close of the last fiscal year there were on the pension rolls 234 , 821 persons , of whom 210 , 363 were army pensioners , 105 , 478 being invalids and 104 , 885 widows and dependent relatives 3 , 420 were navy pensioners , of whom 1 , 636 were invalids and 1 , 784 widows and dependent relatives 21 , 038 were pensioners of the War of 1812 , 15 , 875 of whom were survivors and 5 , 163 were widows . It is estimated that 29 , 535 , 000 will be required for the payment of pensions for the next fiscal year , an amount 965 , 000 less than the estimate for the present year . The geological explorations have been prosecuted with energy during the year , covering an area of about 40 , 000 square miles in the Territories of Colorado , Utah , and New Mexico , developing the agricultural and mineral resources and furnishing interesting scientific and topographical details of that region . The method for the treatment of the Indians adopted at the beginning of my first term has been steadily pursued , and with satisfactory and encouraging results . It has been productive of evident improvement in the condition of that race , and will be continued , with only such modifications as further experience may indicate to be necessary . The board heretofore appointed to take charge of the articles and materials pertaining to the War , the Navy , the Treasury , the Interior , and the Post Office Departments , and the Department of Agriculture , the Smithsonian Institution , and the Commission of Food Fishes , to be contributed , under the legislation of last session , to the international exhibition to be held at Philadelphia during the centennial year 1876 , has been diligent in the discharge of the duties which have devolved upon it and the preparations so far made with the means at command give assurance that the governmental contribution will be made one of the marked characteristics of the exhibition . The board has observed commendable economy in the matter of the erection of a building for the governmental exhibit , the expense of which it is estimated will not exceed , say , 80 , 000 . This amount has been withdrawn , under the law , from the appropriations of five of the principal Departments , which leaves some of those Departments without sufficient means to render their respective practical exhibits complete and satisfactory . The exhibition being an international one , and the Government being a voluntary contributor , it is my opinion that its contribution should be of a character , in quality and extent , to sustain the dignity and credit of so distinguished a contributor . The advantages to the country of a creditable display are , in an international point of view , of the first importance , while an indifferent or uncreditable participation by the Government would be humiliating to the patriotic feelings of our people themselves . I commend the estimates of the board for the necessary additional appropriations to the favorable consideration of Congress . The powers of Europe almost without exception , many of the South American States , and even the more distant Eastern powers have manifested their friendly sentiments toward the United States and the interest of the world in our progress by taking steps to join with us in celebrating the centennial of the nation , and I strongly recommend that a more national importance be given to this exhibition by such legislation and by such appropriation as will insure its success . Its value in bringing to our shores innumerable useful works of art and skill , the commingling of the citizens of foreign countries and our own , and the interchange of ideas and manufactures will far exceed any pecuniary outlay we may make . I transmit herewith the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture , together with the reports of the Commissioners , the board of audit , and the board of health of the District of Columbia , to all of which I invite your attention . The Bureau of Agriculture has accomplished much in disseminating useful knowledge to the agriculturist , and also in introducing new and useful productions adapted to our soil and climate , and is worthy of the continued encouragement of the Government . The report of the Commissioner of Education , which accompanies the report of the Secretary of the Interior , shows a gratifying progress in educational matters . In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to Congress I have called attention to the anomalous , not to say scandalous , condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah , and have asked for definite legislation to correct it . That polygamy should exist in a free , enlightened , and Christian country , without the power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality , seems preposterous . True , there is no law to sustain this unnatural vice but what is needed is a law to punish it as a crime , and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent children , the offspring of this system , and of the possibly innocent plural wives . But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land . While this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another , though perhaps no less an evil the importation of Chinese women , but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations . Observations while visiting the Territories of Wyoming , Utah , and Colorado during the past autumn convinced me that existing laws regulating the disposition of public lands , timber , etc . , and probably the mining laws themselves , are very defective and should be carefully amended , and at an early day . Territory where cultivation of the soil can only be followed by irrigation , and where irrigation is not practicable the lands can only be used as pasturage , and this only where stock can reach water to quench its thirst , can not be governed by the same laws as to entries as lands every acre of which is an independent estate by itself . Land must be held in larger quantities to justify the expense of conducting water upon it to make it fruitful , or to justify utilizing it as pasturage . The timber in most of the Territories is principally confined to the mountain regions , which are held for entry in small quantities only , and as mineral lands . The timber is the property of the United States , for the disposal of which there is now no adequate law . The settler must become a consumer of this timber , whether he lives upon the plain or engages in working the mines . Hence every man becomes either a trespasser himself or knowingly a patron of trespassers . My opportunities for observation were not sufficient to justify me in recommending specific legislation on these subjects , but I do recommend that a joint committee of the two Houses of Congress , sufficiently large to be divided into subcommittees , be organized to visit all the mining States and Territories during the coming summer , and that the committee shall report to Congress at the next session such laws or amendments to laws as it may deem necessary to secure the best interests of the Government and the people of these Territories , who are doing so much for their development . I am sure the citizens occupying the territory described do not wish to be trespassers , nor will they be if legal ways are provided for them to become owners of these actual necessities of their position . As this will be the last annual message which I shall have the honor of transmitting to Congress before my successor is chosen , I will repeat or recapitulate the questions which I deem of vital importance which may be legislated upon and settled at this session First . That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common school education to every child within their limits . Second . No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or in part by the State , nation , or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any community . Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890 , disfranchising none , however , on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect . Third . Declare church and state forever separate and distinct , but each free within their proper spheres and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation . Fourth . Drive out licensed immorality , such as polygamy and the importation of women for illegitimate purposes . To recur again to the centennial year , it would seem as though now , as we are about to begin the second century of our national existence , would be a most fitting time for these reforms . Fifth . Enact such laws as will insure a speedy return to a sound currency , such as will command the respect of the world . Believing that these views will commend themselves to the great majority of the right thinking and patriotic citizens of the United States , I submit the rest to Congress .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The act of Congress entitled An act to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States , and for other purposes , approved April 20 , 1871 , being a law of extraordinary public importance , I consider it my duty to issue this my proclamation , calling the attention of the people of the United States thereto , enjoining upon all good citizens , and especially upon all public officers , to be zealous in the enforcement thereof , and warning all persons to abstain from committing any of the acts thereby prohibited . This law of Congress applies to all parts of the United States and will be enforced everywhere to the extent of the powers vested in the Executive . But inasmuch as the necessity therefor is well known to have been caused chiefly by persistent violations of the rights of citizens of the United States by combinations of lawless and disaffected persons in certain localities lately the theater of insurrection and military conflict , I do particularly exhort the people of those parts of the country to suppress all such combinations by their own voluntary efforts through the agency of local laws and to maintain the rights of all citizens of the United States and to secure to all such citizens the equal protection of the laws . Fully sensible of the responsibility imposed upon the Executive by the act of Congress to which public attention is now called , and reluctant to call into exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me except in cases of imperative necessity , I do , nevertheless , deem it my duty to make known that I will not hesitate to exhaust the powers thus vested in the Executive whenever and wherever it shall become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and laws . It is my earnest wish that peace and cheerful obedience to law may prevail throughout the land and that all traces of our late unhappy civil strife may be speedily removed . These ends can be easily reached by acquiescence in the results of the conflict , now written in our Constitution , and by the due and proper enforcement of equal , just , and impartial laws in every part of our country . The failure of local communities to furnish such means for the attainment of results so earnestly desired imposes upon the National Government the duty of putting forth all its energies for the protection of its citizens of every race and color and for the restoration of peace and order throughout the entire country . In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 3d day of May , 1871 , and of the Independence of the United States the ninety fifth . GRANT . By the President HAMILTON FISSecretary of State .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives I have given very attentive consideration to a resolution of the House of Representatives passed on the 3d of April , requesting the President of the United States to inform the House whether any executive offices acts , or duties , and , if any , what , have within a specified period been performed at a distance from the seat of Government established by law , etc . I have never hesitated and shall not hesitate to communicate to Congress , and to either branch thereof , all the information which the Constitution makes it the duty of the President to give , or which my judgment may suggest to me or a request from either House may indicate to me will be useful in the discharge of the appropriate duties confided to them . I fail , however , to find in the Constitution of the United States the authority given to the House of Representatives one branch of the Congress , in which is vested the legislative power of the Government to require of the Executive , an independent branch of the Government , coordinate with the Senate and House of Representatives , an account of his discharge of his appropriate and purely executive offices , acts , and duties , either as to when , where , or how performed . What the House of Representatives may require as a right in its demand upon the Executive for information is limited to what is necessary for the proper discharge of its powers of legislation or of impeachment . The inquiry in the resolution of the House as to where executive acts have within the last seven years been performed and at what distance from any particular spot or for how long a period at any one time , etc . , does not necessarily belong to the province of legislation . It does not profess to be asked for that object . If this information be sought through an inquiry of the President as to his executive acts in view or in aid of the power of impeachment vested in the House , it is asked in derogation of an inherent natural right , recognized in this country by a constitutional guaranty which protects every citizen , the President as well as the humblest in the land , from being made a witness against himself . During the time that I have had the honor to occupy the position of President of this Government it has been , and while I continue to occupy that position it will continue to be , my earnest endeavor to recognize and to respect the several trusts and duties and powers of the coordinate branches of the Government , not encroaching upon them nor allowing encroachments upon the proper powers of the office which the people of the United States have confided to me , but aiming to preserve in their proper relations the several powers and functions of each of the coordinate branches of the Government , agreeably to the Constitution and in accordance with the solemn oath which I have taken to preserve , protect , and defend that instrument . In maintenance of the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the Government I am compelled to decline any specific or detailed answer to the request of the House for information as to any executive offices , acts , or duties , and , if any , what , have been performed at a distance from the seat of Government established by law , and for how long a period at any one time and in what part of the United States . If , however , the House of Representatives desires to know whether during the period of upward of seven years during which I have held the office of President of the United States I have been absent from the seat of Government , and whether during that period I have performed or have neglected to perform the duties of my office , I freely inform the House that from the time of my entrance upon my office I have been in the habit , as were all of my predecessors with the exception of one , who lived only one month after assuming the duties of his office , and one whose continued presence in Washington was necessary from the existence at the time of a powerful rebellion , of absenting myself at times from the seat of Government , and that during such absences I did not neglect or forego the obligations or the duties of my office , but continued to discharge all of the executive offices , acts , and duties which were required of me as the President of the United States . I am not aware that a failure occurred in any one instance of my exercising the functions and powers of my office in every case requiring their discharge , or of my exercising all necessary executive acts , in whatever part of the United States I may at the time have been . Fortunately , the rapidity of travel and of mail communication and the facility of almost instantaneous correspondence with the offices at the seat of Government , which the telegraph affords to the President in whatever section of the Union he may be , enable him in these days to maintain as constant and almost as quick intercourse with the Departments at Washington as may be maintained while he remains at the capital . The necessity of the performance of executive acts by the President of the United States exists and is devolved upon him , wherever he may be within the United States , during his term of office by the Constitution of the United States . His civil powers are no more limited or capable of limitation as to the place where they shall be exercised than are those which he might be required to discharge in his capacity of Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy , which latter powers it is evident he might be called upon to exercise , possibly , even without the limits of the United States . Had the efforts of those recently in rebellion against the Government been successful in driving a late President of the United States from Washington , it is manifest that he must have discharged his functions , both civil and military , elsewhere than in the place named by law as the seat of Government . No act of Congress can limit , suspend , or confine this constitutional duty . I am not aware of the existence of any act of Congress which assumes thus to limit or restrict the exercise of the functions of the Executive . Were there such acts , I should nevertheless recognize the superior authority of the Constitution , and should exercise the powers required thereby of the President . The act to which reference is made in the resolution of the House relates to the establishing of the seat of Government and the providing of suitable buildings and removal thereto of the offices attached to the Government , etc . It was not understood at its date and by General Washington to confine the President in the discharge of his duties and powers to actual presence at the seat of Government . On the 30th of March , 1791 , shortly after the passage of the act referred to , General Washington issued an Executive proclamation having reference to the subject of this very act from Georgetown , a place remote from Philadelphia , which then was the seat of Government , where the act referred to directed that all offices attached to the seat of Government should for the time remain . That none of his successors have entertained the idea that their executive offices could be performed only at the seat of Government is evidenced by the hundreds upon hundreds of such acts performed by my predecessors in unbroken line from Washington to Lincoln , a memorandum of the general nature and character of some of which acts is submitted herewith and no question has ever been raised as to the validity of those acts or as to the right and propriety of the Executive to exercise the powers of his office in any part of the United States . GRANT . Memorandum of absences of the Presidents of the United States from the national capital during each of the several Administrations , and of public and executive acts performed during the time of such absences . President Washington was frequently absent from the capital he appears to have been thus absent at least one hundred and eighty one days during his term . During his several absences he discharged official and executive duties among them In March , 1791 , he issued a proclamation , dated at Georgetown , in reference to running the boundary for the territory of the permanent seat of the Government . From Mount Vernon he signed an official letter to the Emperor of Morocco , and from the same place the commission of Oliver Wolcott as Comptroller of the Treasury and the proclamation respecting the whisky insurrection in Pennsylvania also various sea letters , the proclamation of the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain , the Executive order of August 4 , 1792 , relative to the duties on distilled spirits , etc . When at Germantown he signed the commission of John Breckenridge as attorney of the United States for Kentucky , and that of engineer of the United States Mint . He proposed to have Yrujo officially presented , as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from Spain , to him at Mount Vernon but although Yrujo went there for the purpose , the ceremony of presentation was prevented by Yrujo s having accidentally left his credentials . President John Adams was absent from the capital during his term of four years , on various occasions , three hundred and eighty five days . He discharged official duties and performed the most solemn public acts at Quincy in the same manner as when at the seat of Government . In 1797 August 25 he forwarded to the Secretary of State a number of passports which he had signed at Quincy . He issued at Quincy commissions to numerous officers of various grades , civil and military . On the 28th of September , 1797 , he forwarded to the Secretary of State a commission for a justice of the Supreme Court , signed in blank at Quincy , instructing the Secretary to fill it with the name of John Marshall if he would accept , and , if not , Bushrod Washington . He issued a proclamation opening trade with certain ports of Domingo , and signed warrants for the execution of two soldiers and for a pardon . President Jefferson was absent from the seat of Government during his two terms of office seven hundred and ninety six days , more than one fourth of the whole official period . During his absence he signed and issued from Monticello seventy five commissions , one letter to the Emperor of Russia , and nine letters of credence to diplomatic agents of the United States accredited to other governments . President Madison was absent from the seat of Government during his two Presidential terms six hundred and thirty seven days . He signed and issued from Montpelier during his absence from the capital seventy one commissions , one proclamation , and nine letters of credence to ministers , accrediting them to foreign governments , and , as it appears , transacted generally all the necessary routine business incident to the Executive office . President Monroe was absent from the capital during his Presidential service of eight years seven hundred and eight days , independent of the year 1824 and the two months of 1825 , for which period no data are found . He transacted public business wherever he happened to be , sometimes at his farm in Virginia , again at his summer resort on the Chesapeake , and sometimes while traveling . He signed and issued from these several places , away from the capital , numerous commissions to civil officers of the Government , exequaturs to foreign consuls , letters of credence , two letters to sovereigns , and thirty seven pardons . President John President Jackson was absent from the capital during his Presidential service of eight years five hundred and two days . He also performed executive duties and public acts while absent . He appears to have signed and issued while absent from the capital very many public papers , embracing commissions , letters of credence , exequaturs , pardons , and among them four Executive proclamations . On the 26th of June , 1833 , he addressed a letter from Boston to Duane , Secretary of the Treasury , giving his views at large on the removal of the deposits from the United States Bank and placing them in the State banks , directing that the change , with all its arrangements , should be , if possible , completed by the 15th September following , and recommending that Amos Kendall should be appointed an agent of the Treasury Department to make the necessary arrangements with the State banks . Soon after , September 23 , a paper signed by the President and purporting to have been read to the Cabinet was published in the newspapers of the day . Early in the next session of Congress a resolution passed the Senate inquiring of the President whether the paper was genuine or not and if it was published by his authority , and requesting that a copy be laid before that body . The President replied , avowing the genuineness of the paper and that it was published by his authority , but declined to furnish a copy to the Senate on the ground that it was purely executive business , and that the request of the Senate was an undue interference with the independence of the Executive , a coordinate branch of the Government . In January , 1837 26th , he refused the privilege to a committee under a resolution of the House of Representatives to make a general investigation of the Executive Departments without specific charges , on the ground , among others , that the use of the books , papers , etc . , of the Departments for such purpose would interfere with the discharge of the public duties devolving upon the heads of the different Departments , and necessarily disarrange and retard the public business . President Van Buren was absent from the capital during his Presidential term one hundred and thirty one days . He discharged executive duties and performed official and public acts during these absences . Among the papers signed by President Van Buren during his absence from the seat of Government are commissions one of these being for a United States judge of a district court , pardons , etc . President Tyler was absent from the capital during his Presidential term one hundred and sixty three days , and performed public acts and duties during such absences , signing public papers and documents to the number of twenty eight , in which were included commissions , exequaturs , letters of credence , pardons , and one proclamation making public the treaty of 1842 between the United States and Ecuador . President Polk was absent from the capital during his Presidential term thirty seven days , and appears to have signed but two official public papers during such absence . President Taylor was absent from the capital during the time he served as President thirty one days , and while absent signed two commissions , three full powers , two exequaturs , and the proclamation of August 11 , 1849 , relative to a threatened invasion of Cuba or some of the Provinces of Mexico . President Fillmore was absent from the capital during the time he served as President sixty days . During such absence he signed pardons , commissions , exequaturs , etc . President Pierce was absent from the capital in all during his Presidential term fifty seven days . The several periods of absence which make up this aggregate were each brief , and it does not appear that during these absences the President signed any public official documents , except one pardon . President Buchanan was absent front the capital during his Presidential term fifty seven days , and the official papers which he is shown to have signed during such absence are three exequaturs and one letter of credence . In addition to the public documents and papers executed by the several Presidents during their absences from the seat of Government , constant official correspondence was maintained by each with the heads of the different Executive Departments .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives I have this day transmitted to the Senate the announcement that Senate bill No . 218 , An act prescribing an oath of office to be taken by persons who participated in the late rebellion , but who are not disqualified from holding office by the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States , has become a law in the manner prescribed by the Constitution , without the signature of the President . If this were a bill for the repeal of the test oath required of persons selected or appointed to offices of honor or trust , it would meet my approval . The effect of the law , however , is to relieve from taking a prescribed oath all those persons whom it was intended to exclude from such offices and to require it from all others . By this law the soldier who fought and bled for his country is to swear to his loyalty before assuming official functions , while the general who commanded hosts for the overthrow of his Government is admitted to place without it . I can not affix my name to a law which discriminates against the upholder of his Government . I believe , however , that it is not wise policy to keep from office by an oath those who are not disqualified by the Constitution , and who are the choice of legal voters but while relieving them from an oath which they can not take , I recommend the release also of those to whom the oath has no application .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives The union of the States of Germany into a form of government similar in many respects to that of the American Union is an event that can not fail to touch deeply the sympathies of the people of the United States . This union has been brought about by the long continued , persistent efforts of the people , with the deliberate approval of the governments and people of twenty four of the German States , through their regularly constituted representatives . In it the American people see an attempt to reproduce in Europe some of the best features of our own Constitution , with such modifications as the history and condition of Germany seem to require . The local governments of the several members of the union are preserved , while the power conferred upon the chief imparts strength for the purposes of self defense , without authority to enter upon wars of conquest and ambition . The cherished aspiration for national unity which for ages has inspired the many millions of people speaking the same language , inhabiting a contiguous and compact territory , but unnaturally separated and divided by dynastic jealousies and the ambition of short sighted rulers , has been attained , and Germany now contains a population of about 34 , 000 , 000 , united , like our own , under one Government for its relations with other powers , but retaining in its several members the right and power of control of their local interests , habits , and institutions . The bringing of great masses of thoughtful and free people under a single government must tend to make governments what alone they should be the representatives of the will and the organization of the power of the people . The adoption in Europe of the American system of union under the control and direction of a free people , educated to self restraint , can not fail to extend popular institutions and to enlarge the peaceful influence of American ideas . The relations of the United States with Germany are intimate and cordial . The commercial intercourse between the two countries is extensive and is increasing from year to year and the large number of citizens and residents in the United States of German extraction and the continued flow of emigration thence to this country have produced an intimacy of personal and political intercourse approaching , if not equal to , that with the country from which the founders of our Government derived their origin . The extent of these interests and the greatness of the German Union seem to require that in the classification of the representatives of this Government to foreign powers there should no longer be an apparent undervaluation of the importance of the German mission , such as is made in the difference between the compensation allowed by law to the minister to Germany and those to Great Britain and France . There would seem to be a great propriety in placing the representative of this Government at Berlin on the same footing with that of its representatives at London and Paris . The union of the several States of Germany under one Government and the increasing commercial and personal intercourse between the two countries will also add to the labors and the responsibilities of the legation . I therefore recommend that the salaries of the minister and of the secretary of legation at Berlin be respectively increased to the same amounts as are allowed to those at London and Paris .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives In submitting my eighth and last annual message to Congress it seems proper that I should refer to and in some degree recapitulate the events and official acts of the past eight years . It was my fortune , or misfortune , to be called to the office of Chief Executive without any previous political training . From the age of 17 I had never even witnessed the excitement attending a Presidential campaign but twice antecedent to my own candidacy , and at but one of them was I eligible as a voter . Under such circumstances it is but reasonable to suppose that errors of judgment must have occurred . Even had they not , differences of opinion between the Executive , bound by an oath to the strict performance of his duties , and writers and debaters must have arisen . It is not necessarily evidence of blunder on the part of the Executive because there are these differences of views . Mistakes have been made , as all can see and I admit , but it seems to me oftener in the selections made of the assistants appointed to aid in carrying out the various duties of administering the Government in nearly every case selected without a personal acquaintance with the appointee , but upon recommendations of the representatives chosen directly by the people . It is impossible , where so many trusts are to be allotted , that the right parties should be chosen in every instance . History shows that no Administration from the time of Washington to the present has been free from these mistakes . But I leave comparisons to history , claiming only that I have acted in every instance from a conscientious desire to do what was right , constitutional , within the law , and for the very best interests of the whole people . Failures have been errors of judgment , not of intent . My civil career commenced , too , at a most critical and difficult time . Less than four years before , the country had emerged from a conflict such as no other nation had ever survived . Nearly one half of the States had revolted against the Government , and of those remaining faithful to the Union a large percentage of the population sympathized with the rebellion and made an enemy in the rear almost as dangerous as the more honorable enemy in the front . The latter committed errors of judgment , but they maintained them openly and courageously the former received the protection of the Government they would see destroyed , and reaped all the pecuniary advantage to be gained out of the then existing state of affairs , many of them by obtaining contracts and by swindling the Government in the delivery of their goods . Immediately on the cessation of hostilities the then noble President , who had carried the country so far through its perils , fell a martyr to his patriotism at the hands of an assassin . The intervening time to my first inauguration was filled up with wranglings between Congress and the new Executive as to the best mode of reconstruction , or , to speak plainly , as to whether the control of the Government should be thrown immediately into the hands of those who had so recently and persistently tried to destroy it , or whether the victors should continue to have an equal voice with them in this control . Reconstruction , as finally agreed upon , means this and only this , except that the late slave was enfranchised , giving an increase , as was supposed , to the Union loving and Union supporting votes . If free in the full sense of the word , they would not disappoint this expectation . Hence at the beginning of my first Administration the work of reconstruction , much embarrassed by the long delay , virtually commenced . It was the work of the legislative branch of the Government . My province was wholly in approving their acts , which I did most heartily , urging the legislatures of States that had not yet done so to ratify the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution . The country was laboring under an enormous debt , contracted in the suppression of rebellion , and taxation was so oppressive as to discourage production . Another danger also threatened us a foreign war . The last difficulty had to be adjusted and was adjusted without a war and in a manner highly honorable to all parties concerned . Taxes have been reduced within the last seven years nearly 300 , 000 , 000 , and the national debt has been reduced in the same time over 435 , 000 , 000 . By refunding the 6 per cent bonded debt for bonds bearing 5 and 4 1 2 per cent interest , respectively , the annual interest has been reduced from over 130 , 000 , 000 in 1869 to but little over 100 , 000 , 000 in 1876 . The balance of trade has been changed from over 130 , 000 , 000 against the United States in 1869 to more than 120 , 000 , 000 in our favor in 1876 . It is confidently believed that the balance of trade in favor of the United States will increase , not diminish , and that the pledge of Congress to resume specie payments in 1879 will be easily accomplished , even in the absence of much desired further legislation on the subject . A policy has been adopted toward the Indian tribes inhabiting a large portion of the territory of the United States which has been humane and has substantially ended Indian hostilities in the whole land except in a portion of Nebraska , and Dakota , Wyoming , and Montana Territories the Black Hills region and approaches thereto . Hostilities there have grown out of the avarice of the white man , who has violated our treaty stipulations in his search for gold . The question might be asked why the Government has not enforced obedience to the terms of the treaty prohibiting the occupation of the Black Hills region by whites . The answer is simple The first immigrants to the Black Hills were removed by troops , but rumors of rich discoveries of gold took into that region increased numbers . Gold has actually been found in paying quantity , and an effort to remove the miners would only result in the desertion of the bulk of the troops that might be sent there to remove them . All difficulty in this matter has , however , been removed subject to the approval of Congress by a treaty ceding the Black Hills and approaches to settlement by citizens . The subject of Indian policy and treatment is so fully set forth by the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , and my views so fully expressed therein , that I refer to their reports and recommendations as my own . The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue on a friendly footing . Questions have arisen from time to time in the foreign relations of the Government , but the United States have been happily free during the past year from the complications and embarrassments which have surrounded some of the foreign powers . The diplomatic correspondence submitted herewith contains information as to certain of the matters which have occupied the Government . The cordiality which attends our relations with the powers of the earth has been plainly shown by the general participation of foreign nations in the exhibition which has just closed and by the exertions made by distant powers to show their interest in and friendly feelings toward the United States in the commemoration of the centennial of the nation . The Government and people of the United States have not only fully appreciated this exhibition of kindly feeling , but it may be justly and fairly expected that no small benefits will result both to ourselves and other nations from a better acquaintance , and a better appreciation of our mutual advantages and mutual wants . Congress at its last session saw fit to reduce the amount usually appropriated for foreign intercourse by withholding appropriations for representatives of the United States in certain foreign countries and for certain consular officers , and by reducing the amounts usually appropriated for certain other diplomatic posts , and thus necessitating a change in the grade of the representatives . For these reasons , immediately upon the passage of the bill making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular service for the present fiscal year , instructions were issued to the representatives of the United States at Bolivia , Ecuador , and Colombia , and to the consular officers for whom no appropriation had been made , to close their respective legations and consulates and cease from the performance of their duties and in like manner steps were immediately taken to substitute charge s d affaires for ministers resident in Portugal , Denmark , Greece , Switzerland , and Paraguay . While thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of sound economy in the foreign service , as in other branches of the Government , I can not escape the conclusion that in some instances the withholding of appropriations will prove an expensive economy , and that the small retrenchment secured by a change of grade in certain diplomatic posts is not an adequate consideration for the loss of influence and importance which will attend our foreign representatives under this reduction . I am of the opinion that a reexamination of the subject will cause a change in some instances in the conclusions reached on these subjects at the last session of Congress . The Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims , whose functions were continued by an act of the last session of Congress until the 1st day of January , 1877 , has carried on its labors with diligence and general satisfaction . By a report from the clerk of the court , transmitted herewith , bearing date November 14 , 1876 , it appears that within the time now allowed by law the court will have disposed of all the claims presented for adjudication . This report also contains a statement of the general results of the labors of the court to the date thereof . It is a cause of satisfaction that the method adopted for the satisfaction of the classes of claims submitted to the court , which are of long standing and justly entitled to early consideration , should have proved successful and acceptable . It is with satisfaction that I am enabled to state that the work of the joint commission for determining the boundary line between the United States and British possessions from the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains , commenced in 1872 , has been completed . The final agreements of the commissioners , with the maps , have been duly signed , and the work of the commission is complete . The fixing of the boundary upon the Pacific coast by the protocol of March 10 , 1873 , pursuant to the award of the Emperor of Germany by Article XXXIV of the treaty of Washington , with the termination of the work of this commission , adjusts and fixes the entire boundary between the United States and the British possessions , except as to the portion of territory ceded by Russia to the United States under the treaty of 1867 . The work intrusted to the commissioner and the officers of the Army attached to the commission has been well and satisfactorily performed . The original of the final agreement of the commissioners , signed upon the 29th of May , 1876 , with the original official lists of astronomical stations observed , the original official list of monuments marking the international boundary line , and the maps , records , and general reports relating to the commission , have been deposited in the Department of State . The official report of the commissioner on the part of the United States , with the report of the chief astronomer of the United States , will be submitted to Congress within a short time . I reserve for a separate communication to Congress a statement of the condition of the questions which lately arose with Great Britain respecting the surrender of fugitive criminals under the treaty of 1842 . The Ottoman Government gave notice , under date of January 15 , 1874 , of its desire to terminate the treaty of 1862 , concerning commerce and navigation , pursuant to the provisions of the twenty second article thereof . Under this notice the treaty terminated upon the 5th day of June , 1876 . That Government has invited negotiations toward the conclusion of a new treaty . By the act of Congress of March 23 , 1874 , the President was authorized , when he should receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman Government or that of Egypt had organized new tribunals likely to secure to citizens of the United States the same impartial justice enjoyed under the exercise of judicial functions by diplomatic and consular officers of the United States , to suspend the operation of the act of June 22 , 1860 , and to accept for citizens of the United States the jurisdiction of the new tribunals . Satisfactory information having been received of the organization of such new tribunals in Egypt , I caused a proclamation to be issued upon the 27th of March last , suspending the operation of the act of June 22 , 1860 , in Egypt , according to the provisions of the act . A copy of the proclamation accompanies this message . The United States has united with the other powers in the organization of these courts . It is hoped that the jurisdictional questions which have arisen may be readily adjusted , and that this advance in judicial reform may be hindered by no obstacles . The necessary legislation to carry into effect the convention respecting commercial reciprocity concluded with the Hawaiian Islands in 1875 having been had , the proclamation to carry into effect the convention , as provided by the act approved August 15 , 1876 , was duly issued upon the 9th day of September last . A copy thereof accompanies this message . The commotions which have been prevalent in Mexico for some time past , and which , unhappily , seem to be not yet wholly quieted , have led to complaints of citizens of the United States of injuries by persons in authority . It is hoped , however , that these will ultimately be adjusted to the satisfaction of both Governments . The frontier of the United States in that quarter has not been exempt from acts of violence by citizens of one Republic on those of the other . The frequency of these is supposed to be increased and their adjustment made more difficult by the considerable changes in the course of the lower part of the Rio Grande River , which river is a part of the boundary between the two countries . These changes have placed on either side of that river portions of land which by existing conventions belong to the jurisdiction of the Government on the opposite side of the river . The subject of adjustment of this cause of difficulty is under consideration between the two Republics . The Government of the United States of Colombia has paid the award in the case of the steamer Montijo , seized by authorities of that Government some years since , and the amount has been transferred to the claimants . It is with satisfaction that I am able to announce that the joint commission for the adjustment of claims between the United States and Mexico under the convention of 1868 , the duration of which has been several times extended , has brought its labors to a close . From the report of the agent of the United States , which accompanies the papers transmitted herewith , it will be seen that within the time limited by the commission 1 , 017 claims on the part of citizens of the United States against Mexico were referred to the commission . Of these claims 831 were dismissed or disallowed , and in 186 cases awards were made in favor of the claimants against the Mexican Republic , amounting in the aggregate to 4 , 125 , 622 . 20 . Within the same period 998 claims on the part of citizens of the Mexican Republic against the United States were referred to the commission . Of these claims 831 were dismissed or disallowed , and in 167 cases awards were made in favor of the claimants against the United States , amounting in the aggregate to 150 , 498 . 41 . By the terms of the convention the amount of these awards is to be deducted from the amount awarded in favor of our citizens against Mexico , and the balance only to be paid by Mexico to the United States , leaving the United States to make provision for this proportion of the awards in favor of its Own citizens . I invite your attention to the legislation which will be necessary to provide for the payment . In this connection I am pleased to be able to express the acknowledgments due to Sir Edward Thornton , the umpire of the commission , who has given to the consideration of the large number of claims submitted to him much time , unwearied patience , and that firmness and intelligence which are well known to belong to the accomplished representative of Great Britain , and which are likewise recognized by the representative in this country of the Republic of Mexico . Monthly payments of a very small part of the amount due by the Government of Venezuela to citizens of the United States on account of claims of the latter against that Government continue to be made with reasonable punctuality . That Government has proposed to change the system which it has hitherto pursued in this respect by issuing bonds for part of the amount of the several claims . The proposition , however , could not , it is supposed , properly be accepted , at least without the consent of the holders of certificates of the indebtedness of Venezuela . These are so much dispersed that it would be difficult , if not impossible , to ascertain their disposition on the subject . In former messages I have called the attention of Congress to the necessity of legislation with regard to fraudulent naturalization and to the subject of expatriation and the election of nationality . The numbers of persons of foreign birth seeking a home in the United States , the ease and facility with which the honest emigrant may , after the lapse of a reasonable time , become possessed of all the privileges of citizenship of the United States , and the frequent occasions which induce such adopted citizens to return to the country of their birth render the subject of naturalization and the safeguards which experience has proved necessary for the protection of the honest naturalized citizen of paramount importance . The very simplicity in the requirements of law on this question affords opportunity for fraud , and the want of uniformity in the proceedings and records of the various courts and in the forms of the certificates of naturalization issued affords a constant source of difficulty . I suggest no additional requirements to the acquisition of citizenship beyond those now existing , but I invite the earnest attention of Congress to the necessity and wisdom of some provisions regarding uniformity in the records and certificates , and providing against the frauds which frequently take place and for the vacating of a record of naturalization obtained in fraud . These provisions are needed in aid and for the protection of the honest citizen of foreign birth , and for the want of which he is made to suffer not infrequently . The United States has insisted upon the right of expatriation , and has obtained , after a long struggle , an admission of the principle contended for by acquiescence therein on the part of many foreign powers and by the conclusion of treaties on that subject . It is , however , but justice to the government to which such naturalized citizens have formerly owed allegiance , as well as to the United States , that certain fixed and definite rules should be adopted governing such cases and providing how expatriation may be accomplished . While emigrants in large numbers become citizens of the United States , it is also true that persons , both native born and naturalized , once citizens of the United States , either by formal acts or as the effect of a series of facts and circumstances , abandon their citizenship and cease to be entitled to the protection of the United States , but continue on convenient occasions to assert a claim to protection in the absence of provisions on these questions . And in this connection I again invite your attention to the necessity of legislation concerning the marriages of American citizens contracted abroad , and concerning the status of American women who may marry foreigners and of children born of American parents in a foreign country . The delicate and complicated questions continually occurring with reference to naturalization , expatriation , and the status of such persons as I have above referred to induce me to earnestly direct your attention again to these subjects . In like manner I repeat my recommendation that some means be provided for the hearing and determination of the just and subsisting claims of aliens upon the Government of the United States within a reasonable limitation , and of such as may hereafter arise . While by existing provisions of law the Court of Claims may in certain cases be resorted to by an alien claimant , the absence of any general provisions governing all such cases and the want of a tribunal skilled in the disposition of such cases upon recognized fixed and settled principles , either provides no remedy in many deserving cases or compels a consideration of such claims by Congress or the executive department of the Government . It is believed that other governments are in advance of the United States upon this question , and that the practice now adopted is entirely unsatisfactory . Congress , by an act approved the 3d day of March , 1875 , authorized the inhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form a State government , with the name of the State of Colorado , and therein provided for the admission of said State , when formed , into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States . A constitution having been adopted and ratified by the people of that State , and the acting governor having certified to me the facts as provided by said act , together with a copy of such constitution and ordinances as provided for in the said act , and the provisions of the said act of Congress having been duly complied with , I issued a proclamation upon the 1st of August , 1876 , a copy of which is hereto annexed . The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been actively employed during the year in subduing , at the request of the Indian Bureau , certain wild bands of the Sioux Indian Nation and in preserving the peace at the South during the election . The commission constituted under the act of July 24 , 1876 , to consider and report on the whole subject of the reform and reorganization of the Army met in August last , and has collected a large mass of statistics and opinions bearing on the subject before it . These are now under consideration , and their report is progressing . I am advised , though , by the president of the commission that it will be impracticable to comply with the clause of the act requiring the report to be presented , through me , to Congress on the first day of this session , as there has not yet been time for that mature deliberation which the importance of the subject demands . Therefore I ask that the time of making the report be extended to the 29th day of January , 1877 . In accordance with the resolution of August 15 , 1876 , the Army regulations prepared under the act of March 1 , 1875 , have not been promulgated , but are held until after the report of the above mentioned commission shall have been received and acted on . By the act of August 15 , 1876 , the cavalry force of the Army was increased by 2 , 500 men , with the proviso that they should be discharged on the expiration of hostilities . Under this authority the cavalry regiments have been strengthened , and a portion of them are now in the field pursuing the remnants of the Indians with whom they have been engaged during the summer . The estimates of the War Department are made up on the basis of the number of men authorized by law , and their requirements as shown by years of experience , and also with the purpose on the part of the bureau officers to provide for all contingencies that may arise during the time for which the estimates are made . Exclusive of engineer estimates presented in accordance with acts of Congress calling for surveys and estimates for improvements at various localities , the estimates now presented are about six millions in excess of the appropriations for the years 1874 75 and 1875 76 . This increase is asked in order to provide for the increased cavalry force should their services be necessary , to prosecute economically work upon important public buildings , to provide for armament of fortifications and manufacture of small arms , and to replenish the working stock in the supply departments . The appropriations for these last named have for the past few years been so limited that the accumulations in store will be entirely exhausted during the present year , and it will be necessary to at once begin to replenish them . I invite your special attention to the following recommendations of the Secretary of War First . That the claims under the act of July 4 , 1864 , for supplies taken by the Army during the war be removed from the offices of the Quartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern Claims Commission . These claims are of precisely similar nature to those now before the Southern Claims Commission , and the War Department bureaus have not the clerical force for their examination nor proper machinery for investigating the loyalty of the claimants . Second . That Congress sanction the scheme of an annuity fund for the benefit of the families of deceased officers , and that it also provide for the permanent organization of the Signal Service , both of which were recommended in my last annual message . Third . That the manufacturing operations of the Ordnance Department be concentrated at three arsenals and an armory , and that the remaining arsenals be sold and the proceeds applied to this object by the Ordnance Department . The appropriations for river and harbor improvements for the current year were 5 , 015 , 000 . With my approval , the Secretary of War directed that of this amount 2 , 000 , 000 should be expended , and no new works should be begun and none prosecuted which were not of national importance . Subsequently this amount was increased to 2 , 237 , 600 , and the works are now progressing on this basis . The improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi River , under James Eads and his associates , is progressing favorably . At the present time there is a channel of 20 . 3 feet in depth between the jetties at the mouth of the pass and 18 . 5 feet at the head of the pass . Neither channel , however , has the width required before payments can be made by the United States . A commission of engineer officers is now examining these works , and their reports will be presented as soon as received . The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that branch of the service to be in condition as effective as it is possible to keep it with the means and authority given the Department . It is , of course , not possible to rival the costly and progressive establishments of great European powers with the old material of our Navy , to which no increase has been authorized since the war , except the eight small cruisers built to supply the place of others which had gone to decay . Yet the most has been done that was possible with the means at command and by substantially rebuilding some of our old ships with durable material and completely repairing and refitting our monitor fleet the Navy has been gradually so brought up that , though it does not maintain its relative position among the progressive navies of the world , it is now in a condition more powerful and effective than it ever has been in time of peace . The complete repairs of our five heavy ironclads are only delayed on account of the inadequacy of the appropriations made last year for the working bureaus of the Department , which were actually less in amount than those made before the war , notwithstanding the greatly enhanced price of labor and materials and the increase in the cost of the naval service growing out of the universal use and great expense of steam machinery . The money necessary for these repairs should be provided at once , that they may be completed without further unnecessary delay and expense . When this is done , all the strength that there is in our Navy will be developed and useful to its full capacity , and it will be powerful for purposes of defense , and also for offensive action , should the necessity for that arise within a reasonable distance from our shores . The fact that our Navy is not more modern and powerful than it is has been made a cause of complaint against the Secretary of the Navy by persons who at the same time criticise and complain of his endeavors to bring the Navy that we have to its best and most efficient condition but the good sense of the country will understand that it is really due to his practical action that we have at this time any effective naval force at command . The report of the Postmaster General shows the excess of expenditures excluding expenditures on account of previous years over receipts for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1876 , to be 4 , 151 , 988 . 66 . Estimated expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1878 , are 36 , 723 , 432 . 43 . Estimated revenue for same period is 30 , 645 , 165 , leaving estimated excess of expenditure , to be appropriated as a deficiency , of 6 , 078 , 267 . 43 . The Postmaster General , like his predecessor , is convinced that a change in the basis of adjusting the salaries of postmasters of the fourth class is necessary for the good of the service as well as for the interests of the Government , and urgently recommends that the compensation of the class of postmasters above mentioned be based upon the business of their respective offices , as ascertained from the sworn returns to the Auditor of stamps canceled . A few postmasters in the Southern States have expressed great apprehension of their personal safety on account of their connection with the postal service , and have specially requested that their reports of apprehended danger should not be made public lest it should result in the loss of their lives . But no positive testimony of interference has been submitted , except in the case of a mail messenger at Spartanburg , in South Carolina , who reported that he had been violently driven away while in charge of the mails on account of his political affiliations . An assistant superintendent of the Railway Mail Service investigated this case and reported that the messenger had disappeared from his post , leaving his work to be performed by a substitute . The Postmaster General thinks this case is sufficiently suggestive to justify him in recommending that a more severe punishment should be provided for the offense of assaulting any person in charge of the mails or of retarding or otherwise obstructing them by threats of personal injury . A very gratifying result is presented in the fact that the deficiency of this Department during the last fiscal year was reduced to 4 , 081 , 790 . 18 , as against 6 , 169 , 938 . 88 of the preceding year . The difference can be traced to the large increase in its ordinary receipts which greatly exceed the estimates therefor and a slight decrease in its expenditures . The ordinary receipts of the Post Office Department for the past seven fiscal years have increased at an average of over 8 per cent per annum , while the increase of expenditures for the same period has been but about 5 . 50 per cent per annum , and the decrease of deficiency in the revenues has been at the rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum . The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture accompanying this message will be found one of great interest , marking , as it does , the great progress of the last century in the variety of products of the soil increased knowledge and skill in the labor of producing , saving , and manipulating the same to prepare them for the use of man in the improvements in machinery to aid the agriculturist in his labors , and in a knowledge of those scientific subjects necessary to a thorough system of economy in agricultural production , namely , chemistry , botany , entomology , etc . A study of this report by those interested in agriculture and deriving their support from it will find it of value in pointing out those articles which are raised in greater quantity than the needs of the world require , and must sell , therefore , for less than the cost of production , and those which command a profit over cost of production because there is not an overproduction . I call special attention to the need of the Department for a new gallery for the reception of the exhibits returned from the Centennial Exhibition , including the exhibits donated by very many foreign nations , and to the recommendations of the Commissioner of Agriculture generally . The reports of the District Commissioners and the board of health are just received too late to read them and to make recommendations thereon and are herewith submitted . The international exhibition held in Philadelphia this year , in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of American independence , has proven a great success , and will , no doubt , be of enduring advantage to the country . It has shown the great progress in the arts , sciences , and mechanical skill made in a single century , and demonstrated that we are but little behind older nations in any one branch , while in some we scarcely have a rival . It has served , too , not only to bring peoples and products of skill and labor from all parts of the world together , but in bringing together people from all sections of our own country , which must prove a great benefit in the information imparted and pride of country engendered . It has been suggested by scientists interested in and connected with the Smithsonian Institution , in a communication herewith , that the Government exhibit be removed to the capital and a suitable building be erected or purchased for its accommodation as a permanent exhibit . I earnestly recommend this and believing that Congress would second this view , I directed that all Government exhibits at the Centennial Exhibition should remain where they are , except such as might be injured by remaining in a building not intended as a protection in inclement weather , or such as may be wanted by the Department furnishing them , until the question of permanent exhibition is acted on . Although the moneys appropriated by Congress to enable the participation of the several Executive Departments in the International Exhibition of 1876 were not sufficient to carry out the undertaking to the full extent at first contemplated , it gives me pleasure to refer to the very efficient and creditable manner in which the board appointed from these several Departments to provide an exhibition on the part of the Government have discharged their duties with the funds placed at their command . Without a precedent to guide them in the preparation of such a display , the success of their labors was amply attested by the sustained attention which the contents of the Government building attracted during the period of the exhibition from both foreign and native visitors . I am strongly impressed with the value of the collection made by the Government for the purposes of the exhibition , illustrating , as it does , the mineral resources of the country , the statistical and practical evidences of our growth as a nation , and the uses of the mechanical arts and the applications of applied science in the administration of the affairs of Government . Many nations have voluntarily contributed their exhibits to the United States to increase the interest in any permanent exhibition Congress may provide for . For this act of generosity they should receive the thanks of the people , and I respectfully suggest that a resolution of Congress to that effect be adopted . The attention of Congress can not be too earnestly called to the necessity of throwing some greater safeguard over the method of choosing and declaring the election of a President . Under the present system there seems to be no provided remedy for contesting the election in any one State . The remedy is partially , no doubt , in the enlightenment of electors . The compulsory support of the free school and the disfranchisement of all who can not read and write the English language , after a fixed probation , would meet my hearty approval . I would not make this apply , however , to those already voters , but I would to all becoming so after the expiration of the probation fixed upon . Foreigners coming to this country to become citizens , who are educated in their own language , should acquire the requisite knowledge of ours during the necessary residence to obtain naturalization . If they did not take interest enough in our language to acquire sufficient knowledge of it to enable them to study the institutions and laws of the country intelligently , I would not confer upon them the right to make such laws nor to select those who do . I append to this message , for convenient reference , a synopsis of administrative events and of all recommendations to Congress made by me during the last seven years . Time may show some of these recommendations not to have been wisely conceived , but I believe the larger part will do no discredit to the Administration . One of these recommendations met with the united opposition of one political party in the Senate and with a strong opposition from the other , namely , the treaty for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States , to which I will specially refer , maintaining , as I do , that if my views had been concurred in the country would be in a more prosperous condition to day , both politically and financially . Santo Domingo is fertile , and upon its soil may be grown just those tropical products of which the United States use so much , and which are produced or prepared for market now by slave labor almost exclusively , namely , sugar , coffee , dyewoods , mahogany , tropical fruits , tobacco , etc . About 75 per cent of the exports of Cuba are consumed in the United States . A large percentage of the exports of Brazil also find the same market . These are paid for almost exclusively in coin , legislation , particularly in Cuba , being unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the products of each country . Flour shipped from the Mississippi River to Havana can pass by the very entrance to the city on its way to a port in Spain , there pay a duty fixed upon articles to be reexported , transferred to a Spanish vessel and brought back almost to the point of starting , paying a second duty , and still leave a profit over what would be received by direct shipment . All that is produced in Cuba could be produced in Santo Domingo . Being a part of the United States , commerce between the island and mainland would be free . There would be no export duties on her shipments nor import duties on those coming here . There would be no import duties upon the supplies , machinery , etc . , going from the States . The effect that would have been produced upon Cuban commerce , with these advantages to a rival , is observable at a glance . The Cuban question would have been settled long ago in favor of free Cuba . Hundreds of American vessels would now be advantageously used in transporting the valuable woods and other products of the soil of the island to a market and in carrying supplies and emigrants to it . The island is but sparsely settled , while it has an area sufficient for the profitable employment of several millions of people . The soil would have soon fallen into the hands of United States capitalists . The products are so valuable in commerce that emigration there would have been encouraged the emancipated race of the South would have found there a congenial home , where their civil rights would not be disputed and where their labor would be so much sought after that the poorest among them could have found the means to go . Thus in cases of great oppression and cruelty , such as has been practiced upon them in many places within the last eleven years , whole communities would have sought refuge in Santo Domingo . I do not suppose the whole race would have gone , nor is it desirable that they should go . Their labor is desirable indispensable almost where they now are . But the possession of this territory would have left the negro master of the situation , by enabling him to demand his rights at home on pain of finding them elsewhere . I do not present these views now as a recommendation for a renewal of the subject of annexation , but I do refer to it to vindicate my previous action in regard to it . With the present term of Congress my official life terminates . It is not probable that public affairs will ever again receive attention from me further than as a citizen of the Republic , always taking a deep interest in the honor , integrity , and prosperity of the whole land .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives A year of peace and general prosperity to this nation has passed since the last assembling of Congress . We have , through a kind Providence , been blessed with abundant crops , and have been spared from complications and war with foreign nations . In our midst comparative harmony has been restored . It is to be regretted , however , that a free exercise of the elective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied to citizens in exceptional cases in several of the States lately in rebellion , and the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed . The States of Virginia , Mississippi , and Texas have been restored to representation in our national councils . Georgia , the only State now without representation , may confidently be expected to take her place there also at the beginning of the new year , and then , let us hope , will be completed the work of reconstruction . With an acquiescence on the part of the whole people in the national obligation to pay the public debt created as the price of our Union , the pensions to our disabled soldiers and sailors and their widows and orphans , and in the changes to the Constitution which have been made necessary by a great rebellion , there is no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation ever did after so protracted and devastating a war . Soon after the existing war broke out in Europe the protection of the United States minister in Paris was invoked in favor of North Germans domiciled in French territory . Instructions were issued to grant the protection . This has been followed by an extension of American protection to citizens of Saxony , Hesse and Saxe Coburg , Gotha , Colombia , Portugal , Uruguay , the Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Chile , Paraguay , and Venezuela in Paris . The charge was an onerous one , requiring constant and severe labor , as well as the exercise of patience , prudence , and good judgment . It has been performed to the entire satisfaction of this Government , and , as I am officially informed , equally so to the satisfaction of the Government of North Germany . As soon as I learned that a republic had been proclaimed at Paris and that the people of France had acquiesced in the change , the minister of the United States was directed by telegraph to recognize it and to tender my congratulations and those of the people of the United States . The reestablishment in France of a system of government disconnected with the dynastic traditions of Europe appeared to be a proper subject for the felicitations of Americans . Should the present struggle result in attaching the hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative government , it will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people . While we make no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of other countries , and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil contests elsewhere , we can not be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France . We were asked by the new Government to use our good offices , jointly with those of European powers , in the interests of peace . Answer was made that the established policy and the true interests of the United States forbade them to interfere in European questions jointly with European powers . I ascertained , informally and unofficially , that the Government of North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from any power , and though earnestly wishing to see the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents , with all of whom the United States are on terms of friendship , I declined on the part of this Government to take a step which could only result in injury to our true interests without advancing the object for which our intervention was invoked . Should the time come when the action of the United States can hasten the return of peace by a single hour , that action will be heartily taken . I deemed it prudent , in view of the number of persons of German and French birth living in the United States , to issue , soon after official notice of a state of war had been received from both belligerents , a proclamation defining the duties of the United States as a neutral and the obligations of persons residing within their territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations . This proclamation was followed by others , as circumstances seemed to call for them . The people , thus acquainted in advance of their duties and obligations , have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality of the United States . It is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba has materially changed since the close of the last session of Congress . In an early stage of the contest the authorities of Spain inaugurated a system of arbitrary arrests , of close confinement , and of military trial and execution of persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents , and of summary embargo of their properties , and sequestration of their revenues by executive warrant . Such proceedings , so far as they affected the persons or property of citizens of the United States , were in violation of the provisions of the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain . Representations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to be citizens of the United States by reason of such violations were made to the Spanish Government . From April , 1869 , to June last the Spanish minister at Washington had been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing such wrongs . That power was found to be withdrawn , in view , as it was said , of the favorable situation in which the island of Cuba then was , which , however , did not lead to a revocation or suspension of the extraordinary and arbitrary functions exercised by the executive power in Cuba , and we were obliged to make our complaints at Madrid . In the negotiations thus opened , and still pending there , the United States only claimed that for the future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should be respected in Cuba , and that as to the past a joint tribunal should be established in the United States with full jurisdiction over all such claims . Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required to prove his case . On the other hand , Spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact , and thus complete equity would be done . A case which at one time threatened seriously to affect the relations between the United States and Spain has already been disposed of in this way . The claim of the owners of the Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall for the illegal seizure and detention of that vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent , and has resulted in an award to the United States , for the owners , of the sum of 19 , 702 . 50 in gold . Another and long pending claim of like nature , that of the whaleship Canada , has been disposed of by friendly arbitrament during the present year . It was referred , by the joint consent of Brazil and the United States , to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton , Her Britannic Majesty s minister at Washington , who kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submitted by the two Governments , and awarded to the United States the sum of 100 , 740 . 09 in gold , which has since been paid by the Imperial Government . These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible , and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor . It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay . Should the pending negotiations , unfortunately and unexpectedly , be without result , it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress and invite its action on the subject . The long deferred peace conference between Spain and the allied South American Republics has been inaugurated in Washington under the auspices of the United States . Pursuant to the recommendation contained in the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December , 1866 , the executive department of the Government offered its friendly offices for the promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the allied Republics . Hesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance of the offer . Ultimately , however , a conference was arranged , and was opened in this city on the 29th of October last , at which I authorized the Secretary of State to preside . It was attended by the ministers of Spain , Peru , Chile , and Ecuador . In consequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia , the conference was adjourned until the attendance of a plenipotentiary from that Republic could be secured or other measures could be adopted toward compassing its objects . The allied and other Republics of Spanish origin on this continent may see in this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare , of our desire to see them blessed with good governments , capable of maintaining order and of preserving their respective territorial integrity , and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relations with them . The time is not probably far distant when , in the natural course of events , the European political connection with this continent will cease . Our policy should be shaped , in view of this probability , so as to ally the commercial interests of the Spanish American States more closely to our own , and thus give the United States all the preeminence and all the advantage which Monroe , Adams , and Clay contemplated when they proposed to join in the congress of Panama . During the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of the Republic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the requisite two thirds vote of the Senate . I was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of this country , commercially and materially , demanded its ratification . Time has only confirmed me in this view . I now firmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States have entirely abandoned the project of accepting as a part of its territory the island of San Domingo a free port will be negotiated for by European nations in the Bay of Samana . A large commercial city will spring up , to which we will be tributary without receiving corresponding benefits , and then will be seen the folly of our rejecting so great a prize . The Government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation . It is a weak power , numbering probably less than 120 , 000 souls , and yet possessing one of the richest territories under the sun , capable of supporting a population of 10 , 000 , 000 people in luxury . The people of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition , and must look for outside support . They yearn for the protection of our free institutions and laws , our progress and civilization . Shall we refuse them The acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical position . It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of commerce . It possesses the richest soil , best and most capacious harbors , most salubrious climate , and the most valuable products of the forests , mine , and soil of any of the West India Islands . Its possession by us will in a few years build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude , which will go far toward restoring to us our lost merchant marine . It will give to us those articles which we consume so largely and do not produce , thus equalizing our exports and imports . In case of foreign war it will give us command of all the islands referred to , and thus prevent an enemy from ever again possessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast . At present our coast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and the Antilies . Twice we must , as it were , pass through foreign countries to get by sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida . San Domingo , with a stable government , under which her immense resources can be developed , will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands of laborers not now upon the island . This labor will take advantage of every available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the blessings of freedom and its sequence each inhabitant receiving the reward of his own labor . Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery , as a measure of self preservation , to retain their laborers . San Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern farms and manufactories . The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food , tools , and machinery will make it necessary that contiguous islands should have the same advantages in order to compete in the production of sugar , coffee , tobacco , tropical fruits , etc . This will open to us a still wider market for our products . The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our annual imports , besides largely increasing our exports . With such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished . With a balance of trade against us including interest on bonds held by foreigners and money spent by our citizens traveling in foreign lands equal to the entire yield of the precious metals in this country , it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise accomplished . The acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the Monroe doctrine it is a measure of national protection it is asserting our just claim to a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from west to east by way of the Isthmus of Darien it is to build up our merchant marine it is to furnish new markets for the products of our farms , shops , and manufactories it is to make slavery insupportable in Cuba and Porto Rico at once , and ultimately so in Brazil it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict it is to provide honest means of paying our honest debts without overtaxing the people it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of everyday life at cheaper rates than ever before and it is , in fine , a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence , industry , and enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume among nations . In view of the importance of this question , I earnestly urge upon Congress early action expressive of its views as to the best means of acquiring San Domingo . My suggestion is that by joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to negotiate a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the acquisition of that island , and that an appropriation be made to defray the expenses of such a commission . The question may then be determined , either by the action of the Senate upon the treaty or the joint action of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of annexation , as in the case of the acquisition of Texas . So convinced am I of the advantages to flow from the acquisition of San Domingo , and of the great disadvantages I might almost say calamities to flow from nonacquisition , that I believe the subject has only to be investigated to be approved . It is to be regretted that our representations in regard to the injurious effects , especially upon the revenue of the United States , of the policy of the Mexican Government in exempting from impost duties a large tract of its territory on our borders have not only been fruitless , but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilege adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed . The expediency of taking into your serious consideration proper measures for countervailing the policy referred to will , it is presumed , engage your earnest attention . It is the obvious interest , especially of neighboring nations , to provide against impunity to those who may have committed high crimes within their borders and who may have sought refuge abroad . For this purpose extradition treaties have been concluded with several of the Central American Republics , and others are in progress . The sense of Congress is desired , as early as may be convenient , upon the proceedings of the commission on claims against Venezuela , as communicated in my messages of March 16 , 1869 , March 1 , 1870 , and March 31 , 1870 . It has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been received from that Government until Congress shall have acted on the subject . The massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien Tsin , under circumstances of great barbarity , was supposed by some to have been premeditated , and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese Empire . The evidence fails to establish such a supposition , but shows a complicity between the local authorities and the mob . The Government at Peking , however , seems to have been disposed to fulfill its treaty obligations so far as it was able to do so . Unfortunately , the news of the war between the German States and France reached China soon after the massacre . It would appear that the popular mind became possessed with the idea that this contest , extending to Chinese waters , would neutralize the Christian influence and power , and that the time was coming when the superstitious masses might expel all foreigners and restore mandarin influence . Anticipating trouble from this cause , I invited France and North Germany to make an authorized suspension of hostilities in the East where they were temporarily suspended by act of the commanders , and to act together for the future protection in China of the lives and properties of Americans and Europeans . Since the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty with Great Britain for abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade have been exchanged . It is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Africa , whence the slaves are taken to Arabian markets . The ratifications of the naturalization convention between Great Britain and the United States have also been exchanged during the recess , and thus a long standing dispute between the two Governments has been settled in accordance with the principles always contended for by the United States . In April last , while engaged in locating a military reservation near Pembina , a corps of engineers discovered that the commonly received boundary line between the United States and the British possessions at that place is about 4 , 700 feet south of the true position of the forty ninth parallel , and that the line , when run on what is now supposed to be the true position of that parallel , would leave the fort of the Hudsons Bay Company at Pembina within the territory of the United States . This information being communicated to the British Government , I was requested to consent , and did consent , that the British occupation of the fort of the Hudsons Bay Company should continue for the present . I deem it important , however , that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fixed by a joint commission of the two Governments , and I submit herewith estimates of the expense of such a commission on the part of the United States and recommend that an appropriation be made for that purpose . The land boundary has already been fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the Georgian Bay . It should now be in like manner marked from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains . I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that Government during the rebellion . The cabinet of London , so far as its views have been expressed , does not appear to be willing to concede that Her Majesty s Government was guilty of any negligence , or did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause of complaint . Our firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse . I therefore recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take proof of the amount and the ownership of these several claims , on notice to the representative of Her Majesty at Washington , and that authority be given for the settlement of these claims by the United States , so that the Government shall have the ownership of the private claims , as well as the responsible control of all the demands against Great Britain . It can not be necessary to add that whenever Her Majesty s Government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims the United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations . The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling . By the first article of the convention of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States it was agreed that the inhabitants of the United States should have forever , in common with British subjects , the right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined . In the waters not included in the limits named in the convention within 3 miles of parts of the British coast it has been the custom for many years to give to intruding fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain . The Imperial Government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishing grounds to the colonial authority known as the Dominion of Canada , and this semi independent but irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way . Vessels have been seized without notice or warning , in violation of the custom previously prevailing , and have been taken into the colonial ports , their voyages broken up , and the vessels condemned . There is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the United States , with a view to political effect upon this Government . The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States . They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within 3 marine miles of any of the coasts , bays , creeks , or harbors of Canada into port , to search the cargo , to examine the master on oath touching the cargo and voyage , and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answers are not given and if such a vessel is found preparing to fish within 3 marine miles of any of such coasts , bays , creeks , or harbors without a license , or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it , they provide that the vessel , with her tackle , etc . , shall be forfeited . It is not known that any condemnations have been made under this statute . Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it , it will become my duty to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the rights of the citizens of the United States . It has been claimed by Her Majesty s officers that the fishing vessels of the United States have no right to enter the open ports of the British possessions in North America , except for the purposes of shelter and repairing damages , of purchasing wood and obtaining water that they have no right to enter at the British custom houses or to trade there except in the purchase of wood and water , and that they must depart within twenty four hours after notice to leave . It is not known that any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been made under this claim . So far as the claim is founded on an alleged construction of he convention of 1818 , it can not be acquiesced in by the United States . It is hoped that it will not be insisted on by Her Majesty s Government . During the conferences which preceded the negotiation of the convention of 1818 the British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the United States from the privilege of carrying on trade with any of His Britannic Majesty s subjects residing within the limits assigned for their use and also that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States engaged in said fishery to have on board any goods , wares , or merchandise whatever , except such as may be necessary for the prosecution of their voyages to and from the said fishing grounds and any vessel of the United States which shall contravene this regulation may be seized , condemned , and confiscated , with her cargo . This proposition , which is identical with the construction now put upon the language of the convention , was emphatically rejected by the American commissioners , and thereupon was abandoned by the British plenipotentiaries , and Article as it stands in the convention , was substituted . If , however , it be said that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial statutes , and not upon the convention , this Government can not but regard them as unfriendly , and in contravention of the spirit , if not of the letter , of the treaty , for the faithful execution of which the Imperial Government is alone responsible . Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities in the coming season to repeat their unneighborly acts toward our fishermen , I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend by proclamation the operation of the laws authorizing the transit of goods , wares , and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United States to Canada , and , further , should such an extreme measure become necessary , to suspend the operation of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States . A like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada in the maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of the Lawrence . This river constitutes a natural outlet to the ocean for eight States , with an aggregate population of about 17 , 600 , 000 inhabitants , and with an aggregate tonnage of 661 , 367 tons upon the waters which discharge into it . The foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to British competition , and the major part of it is done in British bottoms . If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean , the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic would be in foreign hands , their vessels on transatlantic voyages having an access to our lake ports which would be denied to American vessels on similar voyages . To state such a proposition is to refute its justice . During the Administration of John Quincy Adams Clay unanswerably demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river , claiming that the act of the congress of Vienna in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed the judgment of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river to and into the sea , even though passing through the territories of another power . This right does not exclude the coequal right of the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouches into the sea to make such regulations relative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary but those regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity , and should not impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right of transit . It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual agreement . The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of the Lawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain . If the claim made by Clay was just when the population of States bordering on the shores of the Lakes was only 3 , 400 , 000 , it now derives greater force and equity from the increased population , wealth , production , and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier . Since Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our right the principle for which he contended has been frequently , and by various nations , recognized by law or by treaty , and has been extended to several other great rivers . By the treaty concluded at Mayence in 1831 the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first navigable into the sea . By the convention between Spain and Portugal concluded in 1835 the navigation of the Douro throughout its whole extent was made free for the subjects of both Crowns . In 1853 the Argentine Confederation by treaty threw open the free navigation of the Parana and the Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations . In 1856 the Crimean War was closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube . In 1858 Bolivia by treaty declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata , in accordance with fixed principles of national law , as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all nations . In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty , and in December , 1866 , the Emperor of Brazil by imperial decree declared the Amazon to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations . The greatest living British authority on this subject , while asserting the abstract right of the British claim , says It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law , but it is equally difficult to deny , first , that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law secondly , that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi . On the ground that she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise , she insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters . On the ground that she possesses both banks of the Lawrence , where it disembogues itself into the sea , she denies to the United States the right of navigation , though about one half of the waters of Lakes Ontario . Erie , Huron , and Superior , and the whole of Lake Michigan , through which the river flows , are the property of the United States . The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic Seaboard . To the citizens of those States it secures a greater return for their labor to the inhabitants of the seaboard it affords cheaper food to the nation , an increase in the annual surplus of wealth . It is hoped that the Government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her Canadian Provinces have urged her adherence . Our depressed commerce is a subject to which I called your special attention at the last session , and suggested that we will in the future have to look more to the countries south of us , and to China and Japan , for its revival . Our representatives to all these Governments have exerted their influence to encourage trade between the United States and the countries to which they are accredited . But the fact exists that the carrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms , and while this state of affairs exists we can not control our due share of the commerce of the world that between the Pacific States and China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conducted in American vessels . I would recommend a liberal policy toward that line of American steamers one that will insure its success , and even increased usefulness . The cost of building iron vessels , the only ones that can compete with foreign ships in the carrying trade , is so much greater in the United States than in foreign countries that without some assistance from the Government they can not be successfully built here . There will be several propositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session looking to a remedy for this evil . Even if it should be at some cost to the National Treasury , I hope such encouragement will be given as will secure American shipping on the high seas and American shipbuilding at home . The condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for the early action of Congress . The building now rented by that Department is a frail structure , at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion and from the other Departments , is ill adapted to the purpose for which it is used , has not capacity to accommodate the archives , and is not fireproof . Its remote situation , its slender construction , and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood leave but little hope of safety for either the building or its contents in case of the accident of a fire . Its destruction would involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress , of the historic records of the Revolution and of the Confederation , of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archives since the adoption of the Constitution , and of the many other valuable records and papers left with that Department when it was the principal depository of the governmental archives . I recommend an appropriation for the construction of a building for the Department of State . I recommend to your consideration the propriety of transferring to the Department of the Interior , to which they seem more appropriately to belong , all powers and duties in relation to the Territories with which the Department of State is now charged by law or usage and from the Interior Department to the War Department the Pension Bureau , so far as it regulates the payment of soldiers pensions . I would further recommend that the payment of naval pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the Navy Department . The estimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal year are 18 , 244 , 346 . 01 less than for the current one , but exceed the appropriations for the present year for the same items 8 , 972 , 127 . 56 . In this estimate , however , is included 22 , 338 , 278 . 37 for public works heretofore begun under Congressional provision , and of which only so much is asked as Congress may choose to give . The appropriation for the same works for the present fiscal year was 11 , 984 , 518 . 08 . The average value of gold , as compared with national currency , for the whole of the year 1869 was about 134 , and for eleven months of 1870 the same relative value has been about 115 . The approach to a specie basis is very gratifying , but the fact can not be denied that the instability of the value of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity , and tends to keep up prices , to the detriment of trade . The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency are so great that now , when the premium on gold has fallen so much , it would seem that the time has arrived when by wise and prudent legislation Congress should look to a policy which would place our currency at par with gold at no distant day . The tax collected from the people has been reduced more than 80 , 000 , 000 per annum . By steadiness in our present course there is no reason why in a few short years the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the door of the citizen almost entirely . With the revenue stamp dispensed by postmasters in every community , a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobacco in all its forms , and by a wise adjustment of the tariff , which will put a duty only upon those articles which we could dispense with , known as luxuries , and on those which we use more of than we produce , revenue enough may be raised after a few years of peace and consequent reduction of indebtedness to fulfill all our obligations . A further reduction of expenses , in addition to a reduction of interest account , may be relied on to make this practicable . Revenue reform , if it means this , has my hearty support . If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of the Government , for the payment of principal and interest of the public debt , pensions , etc . , by directly taxing the people , then I am against revenue reform , and confidently believe the people are with me . If it means failure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses of Government , and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions , then I am still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform . Revenue reform has not been defined by any of its advocates to my knowledge , but seems to be accepted as something which is to supply every man s wants without any cost or effort on his part . A true revenue reform can not be made in a day , but must be the work of national legislation and of time . As soon as the revenue can be dispensed with , all duty should be removed from coffee , tea and other articles of universal use not produced by ourselves . The necessities of the country compel us to collect revenue from our imports . An army of assessors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen , but that of a tariff for revenue is necessary . Such a tariff , so far as it acts as an encouragement to home production , affords employment to labor at living wages , in contrast to the pauper labor of the Old World , and also in the development of home resources . Under the act of Congress of the 15th day of July , 1870 , the Army has gradually been reduced , so that on the 1st day of January , 1871 , the number of commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated by that law . The War Department building is an old structure , not fireproof , and entirely inadequate in dimensions to our present wants . Many thousands of dollars are now paid annually for rent of private buildings to accommodate the various bureaus of the Department . I recommend an appropriation for a new War Department building , suited to the present and growing wants of the nation . The report of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction in the expenses of the Army for the last fiscal year . For details you are referred to his accompanying report . The expenses of the Navy for the whole of the last year i . e . . , from December 1 , 1869 , the date of the last report are less than 19 , 000 , 000 , or about 1 , 000 , 000 less than they were the previous year . The expenses since the commencement of this fiscal year i . e . . , since July 1 show for the five months a decrease of over 2 , 400 , 000 from those of the corresponding months last year . The estimates for the current year were 28 , 205 , 671 . 37 . Those for next year are 20 , 683 , 317 , with 955 , 100 additional for necessary permanent improvements . These estimates are made closely for the mere maintenance of the naval establishment as now is , without much in the nature of permanent improvement . The appropriations made for the last and current years were evidently intended by Congress , and are sufficient only , to keep the Navy on its present footing by the repairing and refitting of our old ships . This policy must , of course , gradually but surely destroy the Navy , and it is in itself far from economical , as each year that it is pursued the necessity for mere repairs in ships and navy yards becomes more imperative and more costly , and our current expenses are annually increased for the mere repair of ships , many of which must soon become unsafe and useless . I hope during the present session of Congress to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval vessels can be built and repairs made with great saving upon the present cost . It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a Government which represents a country with over 5 , 000 miles of coast line on both oceans , exclusive of Alaska , and containing 40 , 000 , 000 progressive people , with relations of every nature with almost every foreign country , to rest with such inadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy , either of protection or redress . Separated by the ocean from the nations of the Eastern Continent , our Navy is our only means of direct protection to our citizens abroad or for the enforcement of any foreign policy . The accompanying report of the Postmaster General shows a most satisfactory working of that Department . With the adoption of the recommendations contained therein , particularly those relating to a reform in the franking privilege and the adoption of the correspondence cards , a self sustaining postal system may speedily be looked for , and at no distant day a further reduction of the rate of postage be attained . I recommend authorization by Congress to the Postmaster General and Attorney General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through their respective Departments . At present these commissions , where appointments are Presidential , are issued by the State Department . The law in all the Departments of Government , except those of the Post Office and of Justice , authorizes each to issue its own commissions . Always favoring practical reforms , I respectfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing which I would like to see remedied by this Congress . It is a reform in the civil service of the country . I would have it go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks and employees who do not require the advice and consent of the Senate to make their appointments complete . I would have it govern , not the tenure , but the manner of making all appointments . There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of Departments as that of appointments , nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents . The present system does not secure the best men , and often not even fit men , for public place . The elevation and purification of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States . Reform in the management of Indian affairs has received the special attention of the Administration from its inauguration to the present day . The experiment of making it a missionary work was tried with a few agencies given to the denomination of Friends , and has been found to work most advantageously . All agencies and superintendencies not so disposed of were given to officers of the Army . The act of Congress reducing the Army renders army officers ineligible for civil positions . Indian agencies being civil offices , I determined to give all the agencies to such religious denominations as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indians , and perhaps to some other denominations who would undertake the work on the same terms i . e . , as a missionary work . The societies selected are allowed to name their own agents , subject to the approval of the Executive , and are expected to watch over them and aid them as missionaries , to Christianize and civilize the Indian , and to train him in the arts of peace . The Government watches over the official acts of these agents , and requires of them as strict an accountability as if they were appointed in any other manner . I entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will in a few years bring all the Indians upon reservations , where they will live in houses , and have schoolhouses and churches , and will be pursuing peaceful and self sustaining avocations , and where they may be visited by the law abiding white man with the same impunity that he now visits the civilized white settlements . I call your special attention to the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full information on this subject . During the last fiscal year 8 , 095 , 413 acres of public land were disposed of . Of this quantity 3 , 698 , 910 . 05 acres were taken under the homestead law and 2 , 159 , 515 . 81 acres sold for cash . The remainder was located with military warrants , college or Indian scrip , or applied in satisfaction of grants to railroads or for other public uses . The entries under the homestead law during the last year covered 961 , 545 acres more than those during the preceding year . Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the full extent of the means applicable to the purpose . The quantity of land in market will amply supply the present demand . The claim of the settler under the homestead or the preemption laws is not , however , limited to lands subject to sale at private entry . Any unappropriated surveyed public land may , to a limited amount , be acquired under the former laws if the party entitled to enter under them will comply with the requirements they prescribe in regard to the residence and cultivation . The actual settler s preference right of purchase is even broader , and extends to lands which were unsurveyed at the time of his settlement . His right was formerly confined within much narrower limits , and at one period of our history was conferred only by special statutes . They were enacted from time to time to legalize what was then regarded as an unauthorized intrusion upon the national domain . The opinion that the public lands should be regarded chiefly as a source of revenue is no longer maintained . The rapid settlement and successful cultivation of them are now justly considered of more importance to our well being than is the fund which the sale of them would produce . The remarkable growth and prosperity of our new States and Territories attest the wisdom of the legislation which invites the tiller of the soil to secure a permanent home on terms within the reach of all . The pioneer who incurs the dangers and privations of a frontier life , and thus aids in laying the foundation of new commonwealths , renders a signal service to his country , and is entitled to its special favor and protection . These laws secure that object and largely promote the general welfare . They should therefore be cherished as a permanent feature of our land system . Good faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants . The time honored and beneficent policy of setting apart certain sections of public land for educational purposes in the new States should be continued . When ample provision shall have been made for these objects , I submit as a question worthy of serious consideration whether the residue of our national domain should not be wholly disposed of under the provisions the homestead and preemption laws . In addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the States in which they are situated , the lands taken under the agricultural college acts and for internal improvement purposes under the act of September , 1841 , and the acts supplemental thereto , there had been conveyed up to the close of the last fiscal year , by patent or other equivalent title , to States and corporations 27 , 836 , 257 . 63 acres for railways , canals , and wagon roads . It is estimated that an additional quantity of 174 , 735 , 523 acres is still due under grants for like uses . The policy of thus aiding the States in building works of internal improvement was inaugurated more than forty years since in the grants to Indiana and Illinois , to aid those States in opening canals to connect the waters of the Wabash with those of Lake Erie and the waters of the Illinois with those of Lake Michigan . It was followed , with some modifications , in the grant to Illinois of alternate sections of public land within certain limits of the Illinois Central Railway . Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received similar subsidies in connection with railways completed or in process of construction . As the reserved sections are rated at the double minimum , the sale of them at the enhanced price has thus in many instances indemnified the Treasury for the granted lands . The construction of some of these thoroughfares has undoubtedly given a vigorous impulse to the development of our resources and the settlement of the more distant portions of the country . It may , however , be well insisted that much of our legislation in this regard has been characterized by indiscriminate and profuse liberality . The United States should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken by States or corporations , nor grant lands in any instance , unless the projected work is of acknowledged national importance . I am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description but should Congress determine otherwise I earnestly recommend that the right of settlers and of the public be more effectually secured and protected by appropriate legislation . During the year ending September 30 , 1870 , there were filed in the Patent Office 19 , 411 applications for patents , 3 , 374 caveats , and 160 applications for the extension of patents . Thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty two patents , including reissues and designs , were issued , 1 , 010 extended , and 1 , 089 allowed , but not issued by reason of the nonpayment of the final fees . The receipts of the office during the year were 136 , 304 . 29 in excess of its expenditures . The work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted . The preliminary report , containing much information of special value and interest , will be ready for delivery during the present session . The remaining volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent with perfect accuracy in arranging and classifying the returns . We shall thus at no distant day be furnished with an authentic record of our condition and resources . It will , I doubt not , attest the growing prosperity of the country , although during the decade which has just closed it was so severely tried by the great war waged to maintain its integrity and to secure and perpetuate our free institutions . During the last fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners , including the cost of disbursement , was 27 , 780 , 811 . 11 , and 1 , 758 bounty land warrants were issued . At its close 198 , 686 names were on the pension rolls . The labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe scrutiny of the evidence submitted in favor of new claims and to the discovery of fictitious claims which have been heretofore allowed . The appropriation for the employment of special agents for the investigation of frauds has been judiciously used , and the results obtained have been of unquestionable benefit to the service . The subjects of education and agriculture are of great interest to the success of our republican institutions , happiness , and grandeur as a nation . In the interest of one a bureau has been established in the Interior Department the Bureau of Education and in the interest of the other , a separate Department , that of Agriculture . I believe great general good is to flow from the operations of both these Bureaus if properly fostered . I can not commend to your careful consideration too highly the reports of the Commissioners of Education and of Agriculture , nor urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to secure their efficiency . In conclusion I would sum up the policy of the Administration to be a thorough enforcement of every law a faithful collection of every tax provided for economy in the disbursement of the same a prompt payment of every debt of the nation a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit reductions of taxation and tariff , to be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number honest and fair dealings with all other peoples , to the end that war , with all its blighting consequences , may be avoided , but without surrendering any right or obligation due to us a reform in the treatment of Indians and in the whole civil service of the country and , finally , in securing a pure , untrammeled ballot , where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so , just once at each election , without fear of molestation or proscription on account of his political faith , nativity , of color .<speech_sep>In addressing my third annual message to the law making branch of the Government it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year success has generally attended the effort to execute all laws found upon the statute books . The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of laws already enacted , but to learn their spirit and intent and to enforce them accordingly . The past year has , under a wise Providence , been one of general prosperity to the nation . It has , however , been attended with more than usual chastisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire . These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign nations which goes far toward alleviating the distresses occasioned by these calamities . The benevolent , who have so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes , will reap their reward in the consciousness of having performed a noble act and in receiving the grateful thanks of men , women , and children whose sufferings they have relieved . The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly . The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two great nations , speaking one language and having one lineage , settling by peaceful arbitration disputes of long standing and liable at any time to bring those nations into bloody and costly conflict . An example has thus been set which , if successful in its final issue , may be followed by other civilized nations , and finally be the means of returning to productive industry millions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the bayonet and the broadside . I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to , which has been concluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty , and a copy of the protocols of the conferences of the commissioners by whom it was negotiated . This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between the two nations . Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration . I recommend Congress at an early day to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at Geneva and for the several commissioners on the part of the United States called for by the treaty . His Majesty the King of Italy , the President of the Swiss Confederation , and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil have each consented , on the joint request of the two powers , to name an arbiter for the tribunal at Geneva . I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with , by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions . His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with the joint request of the two Governments , and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and Great Britain . The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between themselves certain principles of public law , for which the United States have contended from the commencement of their history . They have also agreed to bring those principles to the knowledge of the other maritime powers and to invite them to accede to them . Negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to the other powers . I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries and to the other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions , to become operative so soon as the proper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its possessions . It is much to be desired that this legislation may become operative before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrangements for the coming season . I have addressed a communication , of which a copy is transmitted herewith , to the governors of New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , Michigan , Illinois , and Wisconsin , urging upon the governments of those States , respectively , the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of the canals , on either side , connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundary , on terms of equality , by the inhabitants of both countries . It is hoped that the importance of the object and the benefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned . I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true position of the forty ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the boundary between the United States and the British North American possessions , between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky Mountains . The early action of Congress on this recommendation would put it in the power of the War Department to place a force in the field during the next summer . The resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Germany has enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended to Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the United States in that country . It is just to add that the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the minister and the consul general at Paris , and the various consuls in France under the supervision of the latter , with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact . Their course has received the commendation of the German Government , and has wounded no susceptibility of the French . The Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United States , and a desire to harmonize with the moderate and just policy which this Government maintains in its relations with Asiatic powers , as well as with the South American Republics . I have given assurances that the friendly feelings of that Government are fully shared by the United States . The ratifications of the consular and naturalization conventions with the Austro Hungarian Empire have been exchanged . I have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy , and the removal of the capital of that Kingdom to Rome . In conformity with the established policy of the United States , I have recognized this change . The ratifications of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged . The two powers have agreed in this treaty that private property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two powers . The United States have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the obligation of nations . The Forty first Congress , at its third session , made an appropriation for the organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain growing out of the insurrection in Cuba . That commission has since been organized . I transmit herewith the correspondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction . It is to be hoped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for their injuries . It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washington between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the allied South American Republics , which has resulted in an armistice , with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace . The intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed . The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his Government to diminish the cordiality of those relations . The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that Government . The inexcusable course of the Russian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic representative . It was impossible , with self respect or with a just regard to the dignity of the country , to permit Catacazy to continue to hold intercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of Government officials , and during his persistent interferences , through various means , with the relations between the United States and other powers . In accordance with my wishes , this Government has been relieved of further intercourse with Catacazy , and the management of the affairs of the imperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely unobjectionable . With Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations . The cabinet of the Mikado has since the close of the last session of Congress selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in several departments of Government . I have reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pursued toward Japan . It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan . The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this Government to swerve from its established course . Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked sailors on the Korean coast , I instructed our minister at Peking to endeavor to conclude a convention with Korea for securing the safety and humane treatment of such mariners . Admiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to protect him in case of need . A small surveying party sent out , on reaching the coast was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage . Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apology for the insult . Neither came . A force was then landed . After an arduous march over a rugged and difficult country , the forts from which the outrages had been committed were reduced by a gallant assault and were destroyed . Having thus punished the criminals , and having vindicated the honor of the flag , the expedition returned , finding it impracticable under the circumstances to conclude the desired convention . I respectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto , herewith submitted , and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see fit to take . The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable laws establishing what is known as the free zone on the frontier of the United States . It is hoped that this may yet be done , and also that more stringent measures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless persons on its frontiers . I hope that Mexico by its own action will soon relieve this Government of the difficulties experienced from these causes . Our relations with the various Republics of Central and South America continue , with one exception , to be cordial and friendly . I recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue installments under the award of the Venezuelan Claims Commission of 1866 . The internal dissensions of this Government present no justification for the absence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations . The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged . It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory step toward the abolition of slavery . Our relations with that Empire , always cordial , will naturally be made more so by this act . It is not too much to hope that the Government of Brazil may hereafter find it for its interest , as well as intrinsically right , to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates . The true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the elevation and education of its laborers . It is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which were voluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out in its West India colonies . The laws and regulations for the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in bondage , with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to their employers . I desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the United States , or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States , are large holders in foreign lands of this species of property , forbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged country . I recommend to Congress to provide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against the holding , owning or dealing in slaves , or being interested in slave property , in foreign lands , either as owners , hirers , or mortgagors , by citizens of the United States . It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety . The existence of a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory , without apparent prospect of an early termination , can not be other than an object of concern to a people who , while abstaining from interference in the affairs of other powers , naturally desire to see every country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace , liberty , and the blessings of free institutions . Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed , in case it should become necessary , to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of bona fide American citizens and to maintain the dignity of the flag . It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of the affairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and conciliation which has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such questions . To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China , and to further aid in retaining the good opinion of those peoples , and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the commercial world , I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of those countries , to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there . Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and of some other powers . As now situated , our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those countries who know our language imperfectly , or procure for the occasion the services of employees in foreign business houses or the interpreters to other foreign ministers . I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting the American lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and Japan and China , and the Australian line almost our only remaining lines of ocean steamers and of increasing their services . The national debt has been reduced to the extent of 86 , 057 , 126 . 80 during the year , and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly 17 , 000 , 000 less than on the 1st of March , 1869 . It was highly desirable that this rapid diminution should take place , both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them . But in view of the accomplishment of these desirable ends of the rapid development of the resources of the country its increasing ability to meet large demands , and the amount already paid , it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment . I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax law . I recommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished , except those collected from spirituous , vinous , and malt liquors , tobacco in its various forms , and from stamps . In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws , after providing for the current expenses of the Government , the interest count , and a sinking fund , and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number . There are many articles not produced at home , but which enter largely into general consumption through articles which are manufactured at home , such as medicines compounded , etc . , etc . , from which very little revenue is derived , but which enter into general use . All such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list . Should a further reduction prove advisable , I would then recommend that it be made upon those articles which can best bear it without disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor . I have not entered into figures , because to do so would be to repeat what will be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury . The present laws for collecting revenue pay collectors of customs small salaries , but provide for moieties shares in all seizures , which , at principal ports of entry particularly , raise the compensation of those officials to a large sum . It has always seemed to me as if this system must at times work perniciously . It holds out an inducement to dishonest men , should such get possession of those offices , to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered , to enable them finally to make large seizures . Your attention is respectfully invited to this subject . Continued fluctuations in the value of gold , as compared with the national currency , has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the country , in keeping up prices of all articles necessary in everyday life . It fosters a spirit of gambling , prejudicial alike to national morals and the national finances . If the question can be met as to how to get a fixed value to our currency , that value constantly and uniformly approaching par with specie , a very desirable object will be gained . For the operations of the Army in the past year , the expense of maintaining it , the estimate for the ensuing year , and for continuing seacoast and other improvements conducted under the supervision of the War Department , I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War . I call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3 , 1869 , which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the Army until provided for by law . I recommend that the number of officers in each grade in the staff corps be fixed , and that whenever the number in any one grade falls below the number so fixed , that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below . I also recommend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by selection from the corps in which the vacancy exists . The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force , without material increase in the expense of supporting it . This is due to the policy which has been adopted , and is being extended as fast as our material will admit , of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations . By this means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising grounds , to visit more frequently the ports where the presence of our flag is desirable , and generally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the Navy in time of peace , without exceeding the number of men or the expenditure authorized by law . During the past year the Navy has , in addition to its regular service , supplied the men and officers for the vessels of the Coast Survey , and has completed the surveys authorized by Congress of the isthmuses of Darien and Tehuantepec , and , under like authority , has sent out an expedition , completely furnished and equipped , to explore the unknown ocean of the north . The suggestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing and improving the materiel of the Navy , and the plan recommended for reducing the personnel of the service to a peace standard , by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers , the reduction of others , and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine , are well considered and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress . I also recommend that all promotions in the Navy above the rank of captain be by selection instead of by seniority . This course will secure in the higher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to young officers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession . The present cost of maintaining the Navy , its cost compared with that of the preceding year , and the estimates for the ensuing year are contained in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy . The enlarged receipts of the Post Office Department , as shown by the accompanying report of the Postmaster General , exhibit a gratifying increase in that branch of the public service . It is the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the people , two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics . With a vast territory like ours , much of it sparsely populated , but all requiring the services of the mail , it is not at present to be expected that this Department can be made self sustaining . But a gradual approach to this end from year to year is confidently relied on , and the day is not far distant when the Post Office Department of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now . The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the Department presided over by him are earnestly recommended to you , special attention . Especially do I recommend favorable consideration of the plan for uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postal system . It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced , and the service as well , if not better , rendered . It would secure the further advantage of extending the telegraph through portions of the country where private enterprise will not construct it . Commerce , trade , and , above all , the efforts to bring a people widely separated into a community of interest are always benefited by a rapid intercommunication . Education , the groundwork of republican institutions , is encouraged by increasing the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of the country . The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate education . I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of the operations of last year and for comparative statements of results with former years . There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the Government the execution of the act of Congress approved April 20 , 1871 , and commonly known as the Kuklux law , in a portion of the State of South Carolina . The necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the Committee to Investigate Southern Outrages . Under the provisions of the above act I issued a proclamation calling the attention of the people of the United States to the same , and declaring my reluctance to exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me , except in case of imperative necessity , but making known my purpose to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and the laws . After the passage of this law information was received from time to time that combinations of the character referred to in this law existed and were powerful in many parts of the Southern States , particularly in certain counties in the State of South Carolina . Careful investigation was made , and it was ascertained that in nine counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful , embracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authority , and having , among other things , the object of depriving the emancipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of preventing the free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views . Among their operations were frequent scourgings and occasional assassinations , generally perpetrated at night by disguised persons , the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different political sentiments from their own or freed persons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens . Thousands of inoffensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless violence , Thereupon , on the 12th of October , 1871 , a proclamation was issued , in terms of the law , calling upon the members of those combinations to disperse within five days and to deliver to the marshal or military officers of the United States all arms , ammunition , uniforms , disguises , and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful purposes . This warning not having been heeded , on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued , suspending the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties in that State . Direction was given that within the counties so designated persons supposed , upon creditable information , to be members of such unlawful combinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United States and delivered to the marshal , to be dealt with according to law . In two of said counties , York and Spartanburg , many arrests have been made . At the last account the number of persons thus arrested was 168 . Several hundred , whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree , were released for the present . These have generally made confessions of their guilt . Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests , and , notwithstanding the large number , it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody . The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the judicial tribunals of the United States . As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law , many persons absconded , and there is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have violated the law . A full report of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General . In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism , repugnant to civilization , to decency , and to the laws of the United States . Territorial officers , however , have been found who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity and with a due sense of the necessity of sustaining the majesty of the law . Neither polygamy nor any other violation of existing statutes will be permitted within the territory of the United States . It is not with the religion of the self styled Saints that we are now dealing , but with their practices . They will be protected in the worship of God according to the dictates of their consciences , but they will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion . It may be advisable for Congress to consider what , in the execution of the laws against polygamy , is to be the status of plural wives and their offspring . The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing the Territorial legislature of Utah to legitimize all children born prior to a time fixed in the act might be justified by its humanity to these innocent children . This is a suggestion only , and not a recommendation . The policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably , so far as can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation . Through the exertions of the various societies of Christians to whom has been intrusted the execution of the policy , and the board of commissioners authorized by the law of April 10 , 1869 , many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations , to cultivate the soil , to perform productive labor of various kinds , and to partially accept civilization . They are being cared for in such a way , it is hoped , as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination . I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy , not only because it is humane , Christian like , and economical , but because it is right . I recommend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting a Territorial government to the Indians in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas . In doing so every right guaranteed to the Indian by treaty should be secured . Such a course might in time be the means of collecting most of the Indians now between the Missouri and the Pacific and south of the British possessions into one Territory or one State . The Secretary of the Interior has treated upon this subject at length , and I commend to you his suggestions . I renew my recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a heritage to our children , to be disposed of only as required for occupation and to actual settlers . Those already granted have been in great part disposed of in such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them , but caution should be exercised even in attaining so desirable an object . Educational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers . I do not wish to be understood as recommending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by the General Government for the encouragement of education . The report of the Secretary of the Interior submitted with this will give you all the information collected and prepared for publication in regard to the census taken during the year 1870 the operations of the Bureau of Education for the year the Patent Office the Pension Office the Land Office , and the Indian Bureau . The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives the operations of his Department for the year . As agriculture is the groundwork of our prosperity , too much importance can not be attached to the labors of this Department . It is in the hands of an able head , with able assistants , all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the nation all useful products adapted to any of the various climates and soils of our vast territory , and to giving all useful information as to the method of cultivation , the plants , cereals , and other products adapted to particular localities . Quietly but surely the Agricultural Bureau is working a great national good , and if liberally supported the more widely its influence will be extended and the less dependent we shall be upon the products of foreign countries . The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials holding positions of responsibility , and requiring ability and character to fill properly , is one to which your attention is invited . But few of the officials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a family , while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest . In private life services demand compensation equal to the services rendered a wise economy would dictate the same rule in the Government service . I have not given the estimates for the support of Government for the ensuing year , nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for the year just passed and the one just preceding , because all these figures are contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly to Congress . These estimates have my approval . More than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired between the armies then arrayed against each other one for the perpetuation , the other for the destruction , of the Union it may well be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the fourteenth amendment should be removed . That amendment does not exclude the ballot , but only imposes the disability to hold offices upon certain classes . When the purity of the ballot is secure , majorities are sure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority . I do not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were before the rebellion of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support the Constitution , and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely the same views , but of less standing in their communities . It may be said that the former violated an oath , while the latter did not the latter did not have it in their power to do so . If they had taken this oath , it can not be doubted they would have broken it as did the former class . If there are any great criminals , distinguished above all others for the part they took in opposition to the Government , they might , in the judgment of Congress , be excluded from such an amnesty . This subject is submitted for your careful consideration . The condition of the Southern States is , unhappily , not such as all true patriotic citizens would like to see . Social ostracism for opinion s sake , personal violence or threats toward persons entertaining political views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens , prevents immigration and the flow of much needed capital into the States lately in rebellion . It will be a happy condition of the country when the old citizens of these States will take an interest in public affairs , promulgate ideas honestly entertained , vote for men representing their views , and tolerate the same freedom of expression and ballot in those entertaining different political convictions . Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved February 21 , 1871 , a Territorial government was organized in the District of Columbia . Its results have thus far fully realized the expectations of its advocates . Under the direction of the Territorial officers , a system of improvements has been inaugurated by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the nation s capital . The citizens of the District having voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of contributing to the adornment of the seat of Government , I recommend liberal appropriations on the part of Congress , in order that the Government may bear its just share of the expense of carrying out a judicious system of improvements . By the great fire in Chicago the most important of the Government buildings in that city were consumed . Those burned had already become inadequate to the wants of the Government in that growing city , and , looking to the near future , were totally inadequate . I recommend , therefore , that an appropriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square on which the burned buildings stood , provided it can be purchased at a fair valuation , or provided that the legislature of Illinois will pass a law authorizing its condemnation for Government purposes and also an appropriation of as much money as can properly be expended toward the erection of new buildings during this fiscal year . The number of immigrants ignorant of our laws , habits , etc . , coming into our country annually has become so great and the impositions practiced upon them so numerous and flagrant that I suggest Congressional action for their protection . It seems to me a fair subject of legislation by Congress . I can not now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints made by immigrants of the treatment they receive , but will endeavor to do so during the session of Congress , particularly if the subject should receive your attention . It has been the aim of the Administration to enforce honesty and efficiency in all public offices . Every public servant who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law . If bad men have secured places , it has been the fault of the system established by law and custom for making appointments , or the fault of those who recommend for Government positions persons not sufficiently well known to them personally , or who give letters indorsing the characters of office seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them . A civil service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired . In mercantile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his friend and his ability to meet his obligations . A reformatory law which would enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for public place would insure great caution in making recommendations . A salutary lesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest public servant in the great number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years . It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proven recreant to the trusts confided to them and in elevating to public office none but those who possess the confidence of the honest and the virtuous , who , it will always be found , comprise the majority of the community in which they live . In my message to Congress one year ago I urgently recommended a reform in the civil service of the country . In conformity with that recommendation Congress , in the ninth section of An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government , and for other purposes , approved March 3 , 1871 , gave the necessary authority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil service reform , and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so . Under the authority of said act I convened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified for the work to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform . Their labors are not yet complete , but it is believed that they will succeed in devising a plan that can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive , the heads of Departments , and members of Congress , and which will redound to the true interest of the public service . At all events , the experiment shall have a fair trial . I have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during the last year , and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your consideration . I submit them with a confidence that your combined action will be wise , statesmanlike , and in the best interests of the whole country .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation In pursuance of the provisions of the act of Congress approved April 10 , 1869 , I hereby designate the 6th day of July , 1869 , as the time for submitting the constitution passed by the convention which met in Richmond , Va . , on Tuesday , the 3d day of December , 1867 , to the voters of said State registered at the date of such submission , viz , July 6 , 1869 , for ratification or rejection .

And I also submit to a separate vote the seventh section of article 3 of the said constitution , which is in the words following In addition to the foregoing oath of office , the governor , lieutenant governor , members of the general assembly , secretary of state , auditor of public accounts , State treasurer , attorney general , and all persons elected to any convention to frame a constitution for this State or to amend or revise this constitution in any manner , and mayor and council of any city or town , shall , before they enter on the duties of their respective offices , take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation Provided , The disabilities therein contained may be individually removed by a three fifths vote of the general assembly I do solemnly swear or affirm that I have never voluntarily borne arms against the United States since I have been a citizen thereof that I have voluntarily given no aid , countenance , counsel , or encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility thereto that I have never sought nor accepted nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office whatever under any authority or pretended authority in hostility to the United States that I have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government , authority , power , or constitution within the United States hostile or inimical thereto . And I do further swear or affirm that , to the best of my knowledge and ability , I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that I take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion , and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter .

In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 14th day of May , 1869 , and of the Independence of the United States of America the ninety third . GRANT . By the President HAMILTON FISSecretary of State .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives It is unusual to notify the two Houses of Congress by message of the promulgation , by proclamation of the Secretary of State , of the ratification of a constitutional amendment . In view , however , of the vast importance of the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution , this day declared a part of that revered instrument , I deem a departure from the usual custom justifiable . A measure which makes at once 4 , 000 , 000 people voters who were heretofore declared by the highest tribunal in the land not citizens of the United States , nor eligible to become so with the assertion that at the time of the Declaration of Independence the opinion was fixed and universal in the civilized portion of the white race , regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in politics , that black men had no rights which the white man was bound to respect , is indeed a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free Government to the present day . Institutions like ours , in which all power is derived directly from the people , must depend mainly upon their intelligence , patriotism , and industry . I call the attention , therefore , of the newly enfranchised race to the importance of their striving in every honorable manner to make themselves worthy of their new privilege . To the race more favored heretofore by our laws I would say , withhold no legal privilege of advancement to the new citizen . The framers of our Constitution firmly believed that a republican government could not endure without intelligence and education generally diffused among the people . The Father of his Country , in his Farewell Address , uses this language Promote , then , as an object of primary importance , institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge . In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion , it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened . In his first annual message to Congress the same views are forcibly presented , and are again urged in his eighth message . I repeat that the adoption of the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred since the nation came into life . The change will be beneficial in proportion to the heed that is given to the urgent recommendations of Washington . If these recommendations were important then , with a population of but a few millions , how much more important now , with a population of 40 , 000 , 000 , and increasing in a rapid ratio . I would therefore call upon Congress to take all the means within their constitutional powers to promote and encourage popular education throughout the country , and upon the people everywhere to see to it that all who possess and exercise political rights shall have the opportunity to acquire the knowledge which will make their share in the Government a blessing and not a danger . By such means only can the benefits contemplated by this amendment to the Constitution be secured . GRANT . HAMILTON FISSECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES . To all to whom these presents may come , greeting Know ye that the Congress of the United States , on or about the 27th day of February , in the year 1869 , passed a resolution in the words and figures following , to wit A Resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled two thirds of both Houses concurring , That the following article be proposed to the legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States , which , when ratified by three fourths of said legislatures , shall be valid as a part of the Constitution , viz . ARTICLE XV . SECTION 1 . The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States , or by any State , on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . SE2 . The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . And further , that it appears from official documents on file in this Department that the amendment to the Constitution of the United States , proposed as aforesaid , has been ratified by the legislatures of the States of North Carolina , West Virginia , Massachusetts , Wisconsin , Maine , Louisiana , Michigan , South Carolina , Pennsylvania , Arkansas , Connecticut , Florida , Illinois , Indiana , New York , New Hampshire , Nevada , Vermont , Virginia , Alabama , Missouri , Mississippi , Ohio , Iowa , Kansas , Minnesota , Rhode Island , Nebraska , and Texas in all , twenty nine States And further , that the States whose legislatures have so ratified the said proposed amendment constitute three fourths of the whole number of States in the United States And further , that it appears from an official document on file in this Department that the legislature of the State of New York has since passed resolutions claiming to withdraw the said ratification of the said amendment , which had been made by the legislature of that State , and of which official notice had been filed in this Department And further , that it appears from an official document on file in this Department that the legislature of Georgia has by resolution ratified the said proposed amendment Now , therefore , be it known that Hamilton Fish , Secretary of State of the United States , by virtue and in pursuance of the second section of the act of Congress approved the 20th day of April , in the year 1818 , entitled An act to provide for the publication of the laws of the United States , and for other purposes , do hereby certify that the amendment aforesaid has become valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution of the United States .
