By the President HAMILTON FISH , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Whereas a state of war unhappily exists between France on the one side and the North German Confederation and its allies on the other side and Whereas the United States are on terms of friendship and amity with all the contending powers and with the persons inhabiting their several dominions and Whereas great numbers of the citizens of the United States reside within the territories or dominions of each of the said belligerents and carry on commerce , trade , or other business or pursuits therein , protected by the faith of treaties and Whereas great numbers of the subjects or citizens of each of the said belligerents reside within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States and carry on commerce , trade , or other business or pursuits therein and Whereas the laws of the United States , without interfering with the free expression of opinion and sympathy , or with the open manufacture or sale of arms or munitions of war , nevertheless impose upon all persons who may be within their territory and jurisdiction the duty of an impartial neutrality during the existence of the contest Now , therefore , Ulysses Grant , President of the United States , in order to preserve the neutrality of the United States and of their citizens and of persons within their territory and jurisdiction , and to enforce their laws , and in order that all persons , being warned of the general tenor of the laws and treaties of the United States in this behalf and of the law of nations , may thus be prevented from an unintentional violation of the same , do hereby declare and proclaim that by the act passed on the 20th day of April , 1818 , commonly known as the neutrality law , the following acts are forbidden to be done , under severe penalties , within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States , to wit 1 . Accepting and exercising a commission to serve either of the said belligerents , by land or by sea , against the other belligerent . 2 . Enlisting or entering into the service of either of the said belligerents as a soldier or as a marine or seaman on board of any vessel of war , letter of marque , or privateer . 3 . Hiring or retaining another person to enlist or enter himself in the service of either of the said belligerents as a soldier or as a marine or seaman on board of any vessel of war , letter of marque , or privateer . 4 .

Beginning or setting on foot or providing or preparing the means for any military expedition or enterprise to be carried on from the territory or jurisdiction of the United States against the territories or dominions of either of the said belligerents . And I do further declare and proclaim that by the nineteenth article of the treaty of amity and commerce which was concluded between His Majesty the King of Prussia and the United States of America on the 11th day of July , 1799 , which article was revived by the treaty of May 1 , 1828 , between the same parties , and is still in force , it was agreed that the vessels of war , public and private , of both parties shall carry freely , wheresoever they please , the vessels and effects taken from their enemies , without being obliged to pay any duties , charges , or fees to officers of admiralty , of the customs , or any others nor shall such prizes be arrested , searched , or put under legal process when they come to and enter the ports of the other party , but may freely be carried out again at any time by their captors to the places expressed in their commissions , which the commanding officer of such vessel shall be obliged to show . And I do further declare and proclaim that it has been officially communicated to the Government of the United States by the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the North German Confederation at Washington that private property on the high seas will be exempted from seizure by the ships of His Majesty the King of Prussia , without regard to reciprocity . And I do further declare and proclaim that it has been officially communicated to the Government of the United States by the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Emperor of the French at Washington that orders have been given that in the conduct of the war the commanders of the French forces on land and on the seas shall scrupulously observe toward neutral powers the rules of international law and that they shall strictly adhere to the principles set forth in the declaration of the congress of Paris of the 16th of April , 1856 that is to say First . That privateering is and remains abolished . Second . That the neutral flag covers enemy s goods , with the exception of contraband of war . Third . That neutral goods , with the exception of contraband of war , are not liable to capture under the enemy s flag . Fourth . That blockades , in order to be binding , must be effective that is to say , maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy and that , although the United States have not adhered to the declaration of 1856 , the vessels of His Majesty will not seize enemy s property found on board of a vessel of the United States , provided that property is not contraband of war . And I do further declare and proclaim that the statutes of the United States and the law of nations alike require that no person within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States shall take part , directly or indirectly , in the said war , but shall remain at peace with each of the said belligerents and shall maintain a strict and impartial neutrality , and that whatever privileges shall be accorded to one belligerent within the ports of the United States shall be in like manner accorded to the other . And I do hereby enjoin all the good citizens of the United States and all persons residing or being within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States to observe the laws thereof and to commit no act contrary to the provisions of the said statutes or in violation of the law of nations in that behalf . And I do hereby warn all citizens of the United States and all persons residing or being within their territory or jurisdiction that while the free and full expression of sympathies in public and private is not restricted by the laws of the United States , military forces in aid of either belligerent can not lawfully be originated or organized within their jurisdiction and that while all persons may lawfully and without restriction , by reason of the aforesaid state of war , manufacture and sell within the United States arms and munitions of war and other articles ordinarily known as contraband of war , yet they can not carry such articles upon the high seas for the use or service of either belligerent , nor can they transport soldiers and officers of either , or attempt to break any blockade which may be lawfully established and maintained during the war , without incurring the risk of hostile capture and the penalties denounced by the law of nations in that behalf . And I do hereby give notice that all citizens of the United States and others who may claim the protection of this Government who may misconduct themselves in the premises will do so at their peril , and that they can in no wise obtain any protection from the Government of the United States against the consequences of their misconduct . In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 22d day of August , 1870 , and of the Independence of the United States of America the ninety fifth . GRANT . By the President HAMILTON FISH , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I have the honor to make the following answer to a Senate resolution of the 8th instant , asking for information as to any interference by any military officer or any part of the Army of the United States with the organization or proceedings of the general assembly of the State of Louisiana , or either branch thereof and also inquiring in regard to the existence of armed organizations in that State hostile to the government thereof and intent on overturning such government by force . To say that lawlessness , turbulence , and bloodshed have characterized the political affairs of that State since its reorganization under the reconstruction acts is only to repeat what has become well known as a part of its unhappy history but it may be proper here to refer to the election of 1868 , by which the Republican vote of the State , through fraud and violence , was reduced to a few thousands , and the bloody riots of 1866 and 1868 , to show that the disorders there are not due to any recent causes or to any late action of the Federal authorities . Preparatory to the election of 1872 a shameful and undisguised conspiracy was formed to carry that election against the Republicans , without regard to law or right , and to that end the most glaring frauds and forgeries were committed in the returns , after many colored citizens had been denied registration and others deterred by fear from casting their ballots . When the time came for a final canvass of the votes , in view of the foregoing facts William Kellogg , the Republican candidate for governor , brought suit upon the equity side of the United States circuit court for Louisiana , and against Warmoth and others , who had obtained possession of the returns of the election , representing that several thousand voters of the State had been deprived of the elective franchise on account of their color , and praying that steps might be taken to have said votes counted and for general relief . To enable the court to inquire as to the truth of these allegations , a temporary restraining order was issued against the defendants , which was at once wholly disregarded and treated with contempt by those to whom it was directed . These proceedings have been widely denounced as an unwarrantable interference by the Federal judiciary with the election of State officers but it is to be remembered that by the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States the political equality of colored citizens is secured , and under the second section of that amendment , providing that Congress shall have power to enforce its provisions by appropriate legislation , an act was passed on the 31st of May , 1870 , and amended in 1871 , the object of which was to prevent the denial or abridgment of suffrage to citizens on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude and it has been held by all the Federal judges before whom the question has arisen , including Justice Strong , of the Supreme Court , that the protection afforded by this amendment and these acts extends to State as well as other elections . That it is the duty of the Federal courts to enforce the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof is too clear for controversy . Section 15 of said act , after numerous provisions therein to prevent an evasion of the fifteenth amendment , provides that the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States shall extend to all cases in law or equity arising under the provisions of said act and of the act amendatory thereof . Congress seems to have contemplated equitable as well as legal proceedings to prevent the denial of suffrage to colored citizens and it may be safely asserted that if Kellogg s bill in the above named case did not present a case for the equitable interposition of the court , that no such case can arise under the act . That the courts of the United States have the fight to interfere in various ways with State elections so as to maintain political equality and rights therein , irrespective of race or color , is comparatively a new , and to some seems to be a startling , idea , but it results as clearly from the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution and the acts that have been passed to enforce that amendment as the abrogation of State laws upholding slavery results from the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution . While the jurisdiction of the court in the case of Kellogg vs . Warmoth and others is clear to my mind , it seems that some of the orders made by the judge in that and the kindred cause of Antoine were illegal . But while they are so held and considered , it is not to be forgotten that the mandate of his court had been contemptuously defied , and they were made while wild scenes of anarchy were sweeping away all restraint of law and order . Doubtless the judge of this court made grave mistakes but the law allows the chancellor great latitude , not only in punishing those who contemn his orders and injunctions , but in preventing the consummation of the wrong which he has judicially forbidden . Whatever may be said or thought of those matters , it was only made known to me that process of the United States court was resisted , and as said act especially provides for the use of the Army and Navy when necessary to enforce judicial process arising thereunder , I considered it my duty to see that such process was executed according to the judgment of the court . Resulting from these proceedings , through various controversies and complications , a State administration was organized with William Kellogg as governor , which , in the discharge of my duty under section 4 , Article Iof the Constitution , I have recognized as the government of the State . It has been bitterly and persistently alleged that Kellogg was not elected . Whether he was or not is not altogether certain , nor is it any more certain that his competitor , McEnery , was chosen . The election was a gigantic fraud , and there are no reliable returns of its result . Kellogg obtained possession of the office , and in my opinion has more right to it than his competitor . On the 20th of February , 1873 , the Committee on Privileges and Elections of the Senate made a report in which they say they were satisfied by testimony that the manipulation of the election machinery by Warmoth and others was equivalent to 20 , 000 votes and they add that to recognize the McEnery government would be recognizing a government based upon fraud , in defiance of the wishes and intention of the voters of the State . Assuming the correctness of the statements in this report and they seem to have been generally accepted by the country , the great crime in Louisiana , about which so much has been said , is that one is holding the office of governor who was cheated out of 20 , 000 votes , against another whose title to the office is undoubtedly based on fraud and in defiance of the wishes and intentions of the voters of the State . Misinformed and misjudging as to the nature and extent of this report , the supporters of McEnery proceeded to displace by force in some counties of the State the appointees of Governor Kellogg , and on the 13th of April , in an effort of that kind , a butchery of citizens was committed at Colfax , which in bloodthirstiness and barbarity is hardly surpassed by any acts of savage warfare . To put this matter beyond controversy I quote from the charge of Judge Woods , of the United States circuit court , to the jury in the case of The United States vs . Cruikshank and others , in New Orleans in March , 1874 . He said In the case on trial there are many facts not in controversy . I proceed to state some of them in the presence and hearing of counsel on both sides and if I state as a conceded fact any matter that is disputed , they can correct me . After stating the origin of the difficulty , which grew out of an attempt of white persons to drive the parish judge and sheriff , appointees of Kellogg , from office , and their attempted protection by colored persons , which led to some fighting , in which quite a number of negroes were killed , the judge states Most of those who were not killed were taken prisoners . Fifteen or sixteen of the blacks had lifted the boards and taken refuge under the floor of the court house . They were all captured . About thirty seven men were taken prisoners . The number is not definitely fixed . They were kept under guard until dark . They were led out , two by two , and shot . Most of the men were shot to death . A few were wounded , not mortally , and by pretending to be dead were afterwards , during the night , able to make their escape . Among them was the Levi Nelson named in the indictment . The dead bodies of the negroes killed in this affair were left unburied until Tuesday , April 15 , when they were buried by a deputy marshal and an officer of the militia from New Orleans . These persons found fifty nine dead bodies . They showed pistol shot wounds , the great majority in the head , and most of them in the back of the head . In addition to the fifty nine dead bodies found , some charred remains of dead bodies were discovered near the court house . Six dead bodies were found under a warehouse , all shot in the head but one or two , which were shot in the breast . The only white men injured from the beginning of these troubles to their close were Hadnot and Harris . The court house and its contents were entirely consumed . There is no evidence that anyone in the crowd of whites bore any lawful warrant for the arrest of any of the blacks . There is no evidence that either Nash or Cazabat , after the affair , ever demanded their offices , to which they had set up claim , but Register continued to act as parish judge and Shaw as sheriff . These are facts in this case as I understand them to be admitted . To hold the people of Louisiana generally responsible for these atrocities would not be just , but it is a lamentable fact that insuperable obstructions were thrown in the way of punishing these murderers and the so called conservative papers of the State not only justified the massacre , but denounced as Federal tyranny and despotism the attempt of the United States officers to bring them to justice . Fierce denunciations ring through the country about office holding and election matters in Louisiana , while every one of the Colfax miscreants goes unwhipped of justice , and no way can be found in this boasted land of civilization and Christianity to punish the perpetrators of this bloody and monstrous Crime . Not unlike this was the massacre in August last . Several Northern young men of capital and enterprise had started the little and flourishing town of Coushatta . Some of them were Republicans and officeholders under Kellogg . They were therefore doomed to death . Six of them were seized and carried away from their homes and murdered in cold blood . No one has been punished , and the conservative press of the State denounced all efforts to that end and boldly justified the crime . Many murders of a like character have been committed in individual eases , which can not here be detailed . For example , Crawford , judge , and Harris , district attorney , of the twelfth judicial district of the State , on their way to court were shot from their horses by men in ambush on the 8th of October , 1873 and the widow of the former , in a communication to the Department of Justice , tells a piteous tale of the persecutions of her husband because he was a Union man , and of the efforts made to screen those who had committed a crime which , to use her own language , left two widows and nine orphans desolate . To say that the murder of a negro or a white Republican is not considered a crime in Louisiana would probably be unjust to a great part of the people , but it is true that a great number of such murders have been committed and no one has been punished therefor and manifestly , as to them , the spirit of hatred and violence is stronger than law . Representations were made to me that the presence of troops in Louisiana was unnecessary and irritating to the people , and that there was no danger of public disturbance if they were taken away . Consequently early in last summer the troops were all withdrawn from the State , with the exception of a small garrison at New Orleans Barracks . It was claimed that a comparative state of quiet had supervened . Political excitement as to Louisiana affairs seemed to be dying out . But the November election was approaching , and it was necessary for party purposes that the flame should be rekindled . Accordingly , on the 14th of September Penn , claiming that he was elected lieutenant governor in 1872 , issued an inflammatory proclamation calling upon the militia of the State to arm , assemble , and drive from power the usurpers , as he designated the officers of the State . The White Leagues , armed and ready for the conflict , promptly responded . On the same day the governor made a formal requisition upon me , pursuant to the act of 1795 and section 4 , Article Iof the Constitution , to aid in suppressing domestic violence . On the next day I issued my proclamation commanding the insurgents to disperse within five days from the date thereof but before the proclamation was published in New Orleans the organized and armed forces recognizing a usurping governor had taken forcible possession of the statehouse and temporarily subverted the government . Twenty or more people were killed , including a number of the police of the city . The streets of the city were stained with blood . All that was desired in the way of excitement had been accomplished , and , in view of the steps taken to repress it , the revolution is apparently , though it is believed not really , abandoned , and the cry of Federal usurpation and tyranny in Louisiana was renewed with redoubled energy . Troops had been sent to the State under this requisition of the governor , and as other disturbances seemed imminent they were allowed to remain there to render the executive such aid as might become necessary to enforce the laws of the State and repress the continued violence which seemed inevitable the moment Federal support should be withdrawn . Prior to , and with a view to , the late election in Louisiana white men associated themselves together in armed bodies called White Leagues , and at the same time threats were made in the Democratic journals of the State that the election should be carried against the Republicans at all hazards , which very naturally greatly alarmed the colored voters . By section 8 of the act of February 28 , 1871 , it is made the duty of United States marshals and their deputies at polls where votes are cast for Representatives in Congress to keep the peace and prevent any violations of the so called enforcement acts and other offenses against the laws of the United States and upon a requisition of the marshal of Louisiana , and in view of said armed organizations and other portentous circumstances , I caused detachments of troops to be stationed in various localities in the State , to aid him in the performance of his official duties . That there was intimidation of Republican voters at the election , notwithstanding these precautions , admits of no doubt . The following are specimens of the means used On the 14th of October eighty persons signed and published the following at Shreveport We , the undersigned , merchants of the city of Shreveport , in obedience to a request of the Shreveport Campaign Club , agree to use every endeavor to get our employees to vote the People s ticket at the ensuing election , and in the event of their refusal so to do , or in case they vote the Radical ticket , to refuse to employ them at the expiration of their present contracts . On the same day another large body of persons published in the same place a paper in which they used the following language We , the undersigned , merchants of the city of Shreveport , alive to the great importance of securing good and honest government to the State , do agree and pledge ourselves not to advance any supplies or money to any planter the coming year who will give employment or rent lands to laborers who vote the Radical ticket in the coming election . I have no information of the proceedings of the returning board for said election which may not be found in its report , which has been published but it is a matter of public information that a great part of the time taken to canvass the votes was consumed by the arguments of lawyers , several of whom represented each party before the board . I have no evidence that the proceedings of this board were not in accordance with the law under which they acted . Whether in excluding from their count certain returns they were right or wrong is a question that depends upon the evidence they had before them but it is very clear that the law gives them the power , if they choose to exercise it , of deciding that way , and , prima facie , the persons whom they return as elected are entitled to the offices for which they were candidates . Respecting the alleged interference by the military with the organization of the legislature of Louisiana on the 4th instant , I have no knowledge or information which has not been received by me since that time and published . My first information was from the papers of the morning of the 5th of January . I did not know that any such thing was anticipated , and no orders nor suggestions were ever given to any military officer in that State upon that subject prior to the occurrence . I am well aware that any military interference by the officers or troops of the United States with the organization of the State legislature or any of its proceedings , or with any civil department of the Government , is repugnant to our ideas of government . I can conceive of no case , not involving rebellion or insurrection , where such interference by authority of the General Government ought to be permitted or can be justified . But there are circumstances connected with the late legislative imbroglio in Louisiana which seem to exempt the military from any intentional wrong in that matter . Knowing that they had been placed in Louisiana to prevent domestic violence and aid in the enforcement of the State laws , the officers and troops of the United States may well have supposed that it was their duty to act when called upon by the governor for that purpose . Each branch of a legislative assembly is the judge of the election and qualifications of its own members but if a mob or a body of unauthorized persons seize and hold the legislative hall in a tumultuous and riotous manner , and so prevent any organization by those legally returned as elected , it might become the duty of the State executive to interpose , if requested by a majority of the members elect , to suppress the disturbance and enable the persons elected to organize the house . Any exercise of this power would only be justifiable under most extraordinary circumstances , and it would then be the duty of the governor to call upon the constabulary or , if necessary , the military force of the State . But with reference to Louisiana , it is to be borne in mind that any attempt by the governor to use the police force of that State at this time would have undoubtedly precipitated a bloody conflict with the White League , as it did on the 14th of September . There is no doubt but that the presence of the United States troops upon that occasion prevented bloodshed and the loss of life . Both parties appear to have relied upon them as conservators of the public peace . The first call was made by the Democrats , to remove persons obnoxious to them from the legislative halls and the second was from the Republicans , to remove persons who had usurped seats in the legislature without legal certificates authorizing them to seats , and in sufficient number to change the majority . Nobody was disturbed by the military who had a legal right at that time to occupy a seat in the legislature . That the Democratic minority of the house undertook to seize its organization by fraud and violence that in this attempt they trampled under foot law that they undertook to make persons not returned as elected members , so as to create a majority that they acted under a preconcerted plan , and under false pretenses introduced into the hall a body of men to support their pretensions by force if necessary , and that conflict , disorder , and riotous proceedings followed are facts that seem to be well established and I am credibly informed that these violent proceedings were a part of a premeditated plan to have the house organized in this way , recognize what has been called the McEnery senate , then to depose Governor Kellogg , and so revolutionize the State government . Whether it was wrong for the governor , at the request of the majority of the members returned as elected to the house , to use such means as were in his power to defeat these lawless and revolutionary proceedings is perhaps a debatable question but it is quite certain that there would have been no trouble if those who now complain of illegal interference had allowed the house to be organized in a lawful and regular manner . When those who inaugurate disorder and anarchy disavow such proceedings , it will be time enough to condemn those who by such means as they have prevent the success of their lawless and desperate schemes . Lieutenant General Sheridan was requested by me to go to Louisiana to observe and report the situation there , and , if in his opinion necessary , to assume the command , which he did on the 4th instant , after the legislative disturbances had occurred , at 9 of the clock p . m . , a number of hours after the disturbances . No party motives nor prejudices can reasonably be imputed to him but honestly convinced by what he has seen and heard there , he has characterized the leaders of the White Leagues in severe terms and suggested summary modes of procedure against them , which , though they can not be adopted , would , if legal , soon put an end to the troubles and disorders in that State . General Sheridan was looking at facts , and possibly , not thinking of proceedings which would be the only proper ones to pursue in time of peace , thought more of the utterly lawless condition of society surrounding him at the time of his dispatch and of what would prove a sure remedy . He never proposed to do an illegal act nor expressed determination to proceed beyond what the law in the future might authorize for the punishment of the atrocities which have been committed , and the commission of which can not be successfully denied . It is a deplorable fact that political crimes and murders have been committed in Louisiana which have gone unpunished , and which have been justified or apologized for , which must rest as a reproach upon the State and country long after the present generation has passed away . I have no desire to have United States troops interfere in the domestic concerns of Louisiana or any other State . On the 9th of December last Governor Kellogg telegraphed to me his apprehensions that the White League intended to make another attack upon the statehouse , to which , on the same day , I made the following answer , since which no communication has been sent to him Your dispatch of this date just received . It is exceedingly unpalatable to use troops in anticipation of danger . Let the State authorities be right , and then proceed with their duties without apprehension of danger . If they are then molested , the question will be determined whether the United States is able to maintain law and order within its limits or not . I have deplored the necessity which seemed to make it my duty under the Constitution and laws to direct such interference . I have always refused except where it seemed to be my imperative duty to act in such a manner under the Constitution and laws of the United States . I have repeatedly and earnestly entreated the people of the South to live together in peace and obey the laws and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see reconciliation and tranquillity everywhere prevail , and thereby remove all necessity for the presence of troops among them . I regret , however , to say that this state of things does not exist , nor does its existence seem to be desired , in some localities and as to those it may be proper for me to say that to the extent that Congress has conferred power upon me to prevent it neither Ku Klux Klans , White Leagues , nor any other association using arms and violence to execute their unlawful purposes can be permitted in that way to govern any part of this country nor can I see with indifference Union men or Republicans ostracized , persecuted , and murdered on account of their opinions , as they now are in some localities . I have heretofore urged the case of Louisiana upon the attention of Congress , and I can not but think that its inaction has produced great evil . To summarize In September last an armed , organized body of men , in the support of candidates who had been put in nomination for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor at the November election in 1872 , and who had been declared not elected by the board of canvassers , recognized by all the courts to which the question had been submitted , undertook to subvert and overthrow the State government that had been recognized by me in accordance with previous precedents . The recognized governor was driven from the statehouse , and but for his finding shelter in the United States custom house , in the capital of the State of which he was governor , it is scarcely to be doubted that he would have been killed . From the statehouse , before he had been driven to the custom house , a call was made , in accordance with the fourth section , fourth article , of the Constitution of the United States , for the aid of the General Government to suppress domestic violence . Under those circumstances , and in accordance with my sworn duties , my proclamation of the 15th of September , 1874 , was issued . This served to reinstate Governor Kellogg to his position nominally , but it can not be claimed that the insurgents have to this day surrendered to the State authorities the arms belonging to the State , or that they have in any sense disarmed . On the contrary , it is known that the same armed organizations that existed on the 14th of September , 1874 , in opposition to the recognized State government , still retain their organization , equipments , and commanders , and can be called out at any hour to resist the State government . Under these circumstances the same military force has been continued in Louisiana as was sent there under the first call , and under the same general instructions . I repeat that the task assumed by the troops is not a pleasant one to them that the Army is not composed of lawyers , capable of judging at a moment s notice of just how far they can go in the maintenance of law and order , and that it was impossible to give specific instructions providing for all possible contingencies that might arise . The troops were bound to act upon the judgment of the commanding officer upon each sudden contingency that arose , or wait instructions which could only reach them after the threatened wrongs had been committed which they were called on to prevent . It should be recollected , too , that upon my recognition of the Kellogg government I reported the fact , with the grounds of recognition , to Congress , and asked that body to take action in the matter otherwise I should regard their silence as an acquiescence in my course . No action has been taken by that body , and I have maintained the position then marked out . If error has been committed by the Army in these matters , it has always been on the side of the preservation of good order , the maintenance of law , and the protection of life . Their bearing reflects credit upon the soldiers , and if wrong has resulted the blame is with the turbulent element surrounding them . I now earnestly ask that such action be taken by Congress as to leave my duties perfectly clear in dealing with the affairs of Louisiana , giving assurance at the same time that whatever may be done by that body in the premises will be executed according to the spirit and letter of the law , without fear or favor . I herewith transmit copies of documents containing more specific information as to the subject matter of the resolution .<speech_sep>By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation The centennial anniversary of the day on which the people of the United States declared their right to a separate and equal station among the powers of the earth seems to demand an exceptional observance . The founders of the Government , at its birth and in its feebleness , invoked the blessings and the protection of a Divine Providence , and the thirteen colonies and three millions of people have expanded into a nation of strength and numbers commanding the position which then was asserted and for which fervent prayers were then offered . It seems fitting that on the occurrence of the hundredth anniversary of our existence as a nation a grateful acknowledgment should be made to Almighty God for the protection and the bounties which He has vouchsafed to our beloved country . I therefore invite the good people of the United States , on the approaching 4th day of July , in addition to the usual observances with which they are accustomed to greet the return of the day , further , in such manner and at such time as in their respective localities and religious associations may be most convenient , to mark its recurrence by some public religious and devout thanksgiving to Almighty God for the blessings which have been bestowed upon us as a nation during the century of our existence , and humbly to invoke a continuance of His favor and of His protection . In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the city of Washington , this 26th day of June , 1876 , and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundredth . GRANT . By the President HAMILTON FISH , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives In accordance with the act of Congress approved March 3 , 1871 , I convened a commission of eminent gentlemen to devise rules and regulations for the purpose of reforming the civil service . Their labors are now completed , and I transmit herewith their report together with the rules which they recommend for my action . These rules have been adopted and will go into effect on the 1st day of January , 1872 . Under the law referred to , as I interpret it , the authority is already invested in the Executive to enforce these regulations , with full power to abridge , alter , or amend them , at his option , when changes may be deemed advisable . These views , together with the report of the commissioners , are submitted for your careful consideration as to whether further legislation may be necessary in order to carry out an effective and beneficial civil service reform . If left to me , without further Congressional action , the rules prescribed by the commission , under the reservation already mentioned , will be faithfully executed but they are not binding , without further legislation , upon my successors . Being desirous of bringing this subject to the attention of Congress before the approaching recess , I have not time to sufficiently examine the accompanying report to enable me to suggest definite legislative action to insure the support which may be necessary in order to give a thorough trial to a policy long needed . I ask for all the strength which Congress can give me to enable me to carry out the reforms in the civil service recommended by the commission , and adopted to take effect , as before stated , on January 1 , 1872 . The law which provides for the convening of a commission to devise rules and regulations for reforming the civil service authorizes , I think , the permanent organization of a primary board under whose general direction all examinations of applicants for public office shall be conducted . There is no appropriation to continue such a board beyond the termination of its present labors . I therefore recommend that a proper appropriation be made to continue the services of the present board for another year , and in view of the fact that three members of the board hold positions in the public service , which precludes them from receiving extra compensation , under existing laws , that they be authorized to receive a fair compensation for extra services rendered by them in the performance of this duty . GRANT . RULES FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE 1 . No person shall be admitted to any position in the civil service within the appointment of the President or the heads of Departments who is not a citizen of the United States who shall not have furnished satisfactory evidence in regard to character , health , and age , and who shall not have passed a satisfactory examination in speaking , reading , and writing the English language . 2 . An advisory board of suitable persons , to be employed by the President under the ninth section of the act of March 3 , 1871 , entitled An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1872 , and for other purposes , shall , so far as practicable , group the positions in each branch of the civil service according to the character of the duties to be performed , and shall grade each group from lowest to highest for the purpose of promotion within the group . Admission to the civil service shall always be to the lowest grade of any group and to such positions as can not be grouped or graded admission shall be determined as provided for the lowest grade . 3 . A vacancy occurring in the lowest grade of any group of offices shall be filled , after due public notice , from all applicants who shall present themselves , and who shall have furnished the evidence and satisfied the preliminary examination already mentioned , and who shall have passed a public competitive examination to test knowledge , ability , and special qualifications for the performance of the duties of the office . The board conducting such competitive examination shall prepare , under the supervision of the Advisory Board , a list of the names of the applicants in the order of their excellence as proved by such examination , beginning with the highest , and shall then certify to the nominating or appointing power , as the case may be , the names standing at the head of such list , not exceeding three , and from the names thus certified the appointment shall be made . 4 . A vacancy occurring in any grade of a group of offices above the lowest shall be filled by a competitive examination of applicants from the other grades of that group , and the list of names from which the appointment is to be made shall be prepared and certified as provided in the preceding rule but if no such applicants are found competent the appointment shall be made upon an examination of all applicants , conducted in accordance with the provisions for admission to the lowest grade . 5 . Applicants certified as otherwise qualified for appointment as cashiers of collectors of customs , cashiers of assistant treasurers , cashiers of postmasters , superintendents of money order divisions in post offices , and such other custodians of large sums of money as may hereafter be designated by the Advisory Board , and for whose pecuniary fidelity another officer is responsible , shall , nevertheless , not be appointed except with the approval of such other officer . 6 . Postmasters whose annual salary is less than 200 may be appointed upon the written request of applicants , with such evidence of character and fitness as shall be satisfactory to the head of the Department . 7 . The appointment of all persons entering the civil service in accordance with these regulations , excepting persons appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , postmasters , and persons appointed to any position in a foreign country , shall be made for a probationary term of six months , during which the conduct and capacity of such persons shall be tested and if at the end of said probationary term satisfactory proofs of their fitness shall have been furnished by the board of examiners to the head of the Department in which they shall have been employed during said term , they shall be reappointed . 8 . The President will designate three persons in each Department of the public service to serve as a board of examiners , which , under the supervision of the Advisory Board and under regulations to be prescribed by it , and at such times and places as it may determine , shall conduct , personally or by persons approved by the Advisory Board , all investigations and examinations for admission into said Departments or for promotion therein . 9 . Any person who , after long and faithful service in a Department , shall be incapacitated by mental or bodily infirmity for the efficient discharge of the duties of his position may be appointed by the head of the Department , at his discretion , to a position of less responsibility in the same Department . 10 . Nothing in these rules shall prevent the appointment of aliens to positions in the consular service which by reason of small compensation or of other sufficient cause are , in the judgment of the appointing power , necessarily so filled , nor the appointment of such persons within the United States as are indispensable to a proper discharge of the duties of certain positions , but who may not be familiar with the English language or legally capable of naturalization . 11 . No head of a Department nor any subordinate officer of the Government shall , as such officer , authorize or permit or assist in levying any assessment of money for political purposes , under the form of voluntary contributions or otherwise , upon any person employed under his control , nor shall any such person pay any money so assessed . 12 . The Advisory Board shall at any time recommend to the President such changes in these rules as it may consider necessary to secure the greater efficiency of the civil service . 13 . From these rules are excepted the heads of Departments , Assistant Secretaries of Departments , Assistant Attorneys General , and First Assistant Postmaster General , Solicitor General , Solicitor of the Treasury , Naval Solicitor , Solicitor of Internal Revenue , examiner of claims in the State Department , Treasurer of the United States , Register of the Treasury , First and Second Comptrollers of the Treasury , judges of the United States courts , district attorneys , private secretary of the President , ambassadors and other public ministers , Superintendent of the Coast Survey , Director of the Mint , governors of Territories , special commissioners , special counsel , visiting and examining boards , persons appointed to positions without compensation for services , dispatch agents , and bearers of dispatches .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States Herewith I return , Senate bill No . 617 , entitled An act to fix the amount of United States notes and the circulation of national banks , and for other purposes , without my approval . In doing so I must express my regret at not being able to give my assent to a measure which has received the sanction of a majority of the legislators chosen by the people to make laws for their guidance , and have studiously sought to find sufficient arguments to justify such assent , but unsuccessfully . Practically it is a question whether the measure under discussion would give an additional dollar to the irredeemable paper currency of the country or not , and whether by requiring three fourths of the reserve to be retained by the banks and prohibiting interest to be received on the balance it might not prove a contraction . But the fact can not be concealed that theoretically the bill increases the paper circulation 100 , 000 , 000 , less only the amount of reserves restrained from circulation by the provision of the second section . The measure has been supported on the theory that it would give increased circulation . It is a fair inference , therefore , that if in practice the measure should fail to create the abundance of circulation expected of it the friends of the measure , particularly those out of Congress , would clamor for such inflation as would give the expected relief . The theory , in my belief , is a departure from true principles of finance , national interest , national obligations to creditors , Congressional promises , party pledges on the part of both political parties , and of personal views and promises made by me in every annual message sent to Congress and in each inaugural address . In my annual message to Congress in December , 1869 , the following passages appear Among the evils growing out of the rebellion , and not yet referred to , is that of an irredeemable currency . It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest attention . It is a duty , and one of the highest duties , of Government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fixed , unvarying value . This implies a return to a specie basis , and no substitute for it can be devised . It should be commenced now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class . Immediate resumption , if practicable , would not be desirable . It would compel the debtor class to pay , beyond their contracts , the premium on gold at the date of their purchase , and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands . Fluctuation , however , in the paper value of the measure of all values gold is detrimental to the interests of trade . It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler , for in all sales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received . I earnestly recommend to you , then , such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency . I still adhere to the views then expressed . As early as December 4 , 1865 , the House of Representatives passed a resolution , by a vote of 144 yeas to 6 nays , concurring in the views of the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to the necessity of a contraction of the currency , with a view to as early a resumption of specie payments as the business interests of the country will permit , and pledging cooperative action to this end as speedily as possible . The first act passed by the Forty first Congress , approved on the 18th day of March , 1869 , was as follows AN ACT to strengthen the public credit Be it enacted , etc . , That in order to remove any doubt as to the purpose of the Government to discharge all just obligations to the public creditors , and to settle conflicting questions and interpretations of the law by virtue of which such obligations have been contracted , it is hereby provided and declared that the faith of the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment in coin or its equivalent of all the obligations of the United States not bearing interest , known as United States notes , and all the interest bearing obligations of the United States , except in cases where the law authorizing the issue of any such obligation has expressly provided that the same may be paid in lawful money or in other currency than gold and silver but none of the said interest bearing obligations not already due shall be redeemed or paid before maturity unless at such time United States notes shall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder , or unless at such time bonds of the United States bearing a lower rate of interest than the bonds to be redeemed can be sold at par in coin . And the United States also solemnly pledges its faith to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of the United States notes in coin . This act still remains as a continuing pledge of the faith of the United States to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of the United States notes in coin . A declaration contained in the act of June 30 , 1864 , created an obligation that the total amount of United States notes issued or to be issued should never exceed 400 , 000 , 000 . The amount in actual circulation was actually reduced to 356 , 000 , 000 , at which point Congress passed the act of February 4 , 1868 , suspending the further reduction of the currency . The forty four millions have ever been regarded as a reserve , to be used only in case of emergency , such as has occurred on several occasions , and must occur when from any cause revenues suddenly fall below expenditures and such a reserve is necessary , because the fractional currency , amounting to fifty millions , is redeemable in legal tender on call . It may be said that such a return of fractional currency for redemption is impossible but let steps be taken for a return to a specie basis and it will be found that silver will take the place of fractional currency as rapidly as it can be supplied , when the premium on gold reaches a sufficiently low point . With the amount of United States notes to be issued permanently fixed within proper limits and the Treasury so strengthened as to be able to redeem them in coin on demand it will then be safe to inaugurate a system of free banking with such provisions as to make compulsory redemption of the circulating notes of the banks in coin , or in United States notes , themselves redeemable and made equivalent to coin . As a measure preparatory to free banking , and for placing the Government in a condition to redeem its notes in coin at the earliest practicable period , the revenues of the country should be increased so as to pay current expenses , provide for the sinking fund required by law , and also a surplus to be retained in the Treasury in gold . I am not a believer in any artificial method of making paper money equal to coin when the coin is not owned or held ready to redeem the promises to pay , for paper money is nothing more than promises to pay , and is valuable exactly in proportion to the amount of coin that it can be converted into . While coin is not used as a circulating medium , or the currency of the country is not convertible into it at par , it becomes an article of commerce as much as any other product . The surplus will seek a foreign market as will any other surplus . The balance of trade has nothing to do with the question . Duties on imports being required in coin creates a limited demand for gold . About enough to satisfy that demand remains in the country . To increase this supply I see no way open but by the Government hoarding through the means above given , and possibly by requiring the national banks to aid . It is claimed by the advocates of the measure herewith returned that there is an unequal distribution of the banking capital of the country . I was disposed to give great weight to this view of the question at first , but on reflection it will be remembered that there still remains 4 , 000 , 000 of authorized bank note circulation assigned to States having less than their quota not yet taken . In addition to this the States having less than their quota of bank circulation have the option of twenty five millions more to be taken from those States having more than their proportion . When this is all taken up , or when specie payments are fully restored or are in rapid process of restoration , will be the time to consider the question of more currency .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives In coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate of this great nation , it is with gratitude to the Giver of All Good for the many benefits we enjoy . We are blessed with peace at home , and are without entangling alliances abroad to forebode trouble with a territory unsurpassed in fertility , of an area equal to the abundant support of 500 , 000 , 000 people , and abounding in every variety of useful mineral in quantity sufficient to supply the world for generations with exuberant crops with a variety of climate adapted to the production of every species of earth s riches and suited to the habits , tastes , and requirements of every living thing with a population of 40 , 000 , 000 free people , all speaking one language with facilities for every mortal to acquire an education with institutions closing to none the avenues to fame or any blessing of fortune that may be coveted with freedom of the pulpit , the press , and the school with a revenue flowing into the National Treasury beyond the requirements of the Government . Happily , harmony is being rapidly restored within our own borders . Manufactures hitherto unknown in our country are springing up in all sections , producing a degree of national independence unequaled by that of any other power . These blessings and countless others are intrusted to your care and mine for safe keeping for the brief period of our tenure of office . In a short time we must , each of us , return to the ranks of the people , who have conferred upon us our honors , and account to them for our stewardship . I earnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned by a free and enlightened constituency nor by our own consciences . Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude , aided , as it was , by the sympathies and assistance of nations with which we were at peace , eleven States of the Union were , four years ago , left without legal State governments . A national debt had been contracted American commerce was almost driven from the seas the industry of one half of the country had been taken from the control of the capitalist and placed where all labor rightfully belongs in the keeping of the laborer . The work of restoring State governments loyal to the Union , of protecting and fostering free labor , and providing means for paying the interest on the public debt has received ample attention from Congress . Although your efforts have not met with the success in all particulars that might have been desired , yet on the whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonably anticipated . Seven States which passed ordinances of secession have been fully restored to their places in the Union . The eighth Georgia held an election at which she ratified her constitution , republican in form , elected a governor , Members of Congress , a State legislature , and all other officers required . The governor was duly installed , and the legislature met and performed all the acts then required of them by the reconstruction acts of Congress . Subsequently , however , in violation of the constitution which they had just ratified as since decided by the supreme court of the State , they unseated the colored members of the legislature and admitted to seats some members who are disqualified by the third clause of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution an article which they themselves had contributed to ratify . Under these circumstances I would submit to you whether it would not be wise , without delay , to enact a law authorizing the governor of Georgia to convene the members originally elected to the legislature , requiring each member to take the oath prescribed by the reconstruction acts , and none to be admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the fourteenth amendment . The freedmen , under the protection which they have received , are making rapid progress in learning , and no complaints are heard of lack of industry on their part where they receive fair remuneration for their labor . The means provided for paying the interest on the public debt , with all other expenses of Government , are more than ample . The loss of our commerce is the only result of the late rebellion which has not received sufficient attention from you . To this subject I call your earnest attention . I will not now suggest plans by which this object may be effected , but will , if necessary , make it the subject of a special message during the session of Congress . At the March term Congress by joint resolution authorized the Executive to order elections in the States of Virginia , Mississippi , and Texas , to submit to them the constitutions which each had previously , in convention , framed , and submit the constitutions , either entire or in separate parts , to be voted upon , at the discretion of the Executive . Under this authority elections were called . In Virginia the election took place on the 6th of July , 1869 . The governor and lieutenant governor elected have been installed . The legislature met and did all required by this resolution and by all the reconstruction acts of Congress , and abstained from all doubtful authority . I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be promptly admitted to their seats , and that the State be fully restored to its place in the family of States . Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas , to commence on the 30th of November , 1869 , and to last two days in Mississippi and four days in Texas . The elections have taken place , but the result is not known . It is to be hoped that the acts of the legislatures of these States , when they meet , will be such as to receive your approval , and thus close the work of reconstruction . Among the evils growing out of the rebellion , and not yet referred to , is that of an irredeemable currency . It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest attention . It is a duty , and one of the highest duties , of Government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fixed , unvarying value . This implies a return to a specie basis , and no substitute for it can be devised . It should be commenced now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class . Immediate resumption , if practicable , would not be desirable . It would compel the debtor class to pay , beyond their contracts , the premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands . Fluctuation , however , in the paper value of the measure of all values gold is detrimental to the interests of trade . It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler , for in all sales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received . I earnestly recommend to you , then , such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency . The methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as are the speculators on political economy . To secure the latter I see but one way , and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper , at a fixed price , whenever presented , and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold . The vast resources of the nation , both developed and undeveloped , ought to make our credit the best on earth . With a less burden of taxation than the citizen has endured for six years past , the entire public debt could be paid in ten years . But it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time . Year by year the ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio . But the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be done without the violation of contract . The public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from ten to forty years to run , bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent and 5 per cent , respectively . It is optional with the Government to pay these bonds at any period after the expiration of the least time mentioned upon their face . The time has already expired when a great part of them may be taken up , and is rapidly approaching when all may be . It is believed that all which are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding 4 1 2 per cent , and as rapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replaced in the same way . To accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of three or four of the money centers of Europe , or by any assistant treasurer of the United States , at the option of the holder of the bond . I suggest this subject for the consideration of Congress , and also , simultaneously with this , the propriety of redeeming our currency , as before suggested , at its market value at the time the law goes into effect , increasing the rate at which currency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week , at the same rate of interest as Government pays upon its bonds . The subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention . The revenues of the country are greater than the requirements , and may with safety be reduced . But as the funding of the debt in a 4 or a 4 1 2 per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely , thus , after funding , justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be now expedient , I suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting of Congress . It may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws , but a general revision of the laws regulating this subject I recommend the postponement of for the present . I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes , but at a reduced rate , say of 3 per cent , and this tax to expire in three years . With the funding of the national debt , as here suggested , I feel safe in saying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once , and may be still further reduced from year to year , as the resources of the country are developed . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1869 , to be 370 , 943 , 747 , and the expenditures , including interest , bounties , etc . , to be 321 , 490 , 597 . The estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the Government , and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the public debt . The receipts in the Treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund , as provided by law . To lock up the surplus in the Treasury and withhold it from circulation would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country . Under these circumstances the Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency in the Treasury in the purchase of Government bonds , thus reducing the interest bearing indebtedness of the country , and of submitting to Congress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds so purchased . The bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about seventy five millions , including those belonging to the sinking fund . I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund . Your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner of customs revenue for the increase of salaries to certain classes of officials the substitution of increased national bank circulation to replace the outstanding 3 per cent certificates and most especially to his recommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines , penalties , forfeitures , etc . , to officers of the Government or to informers . The office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue is one of the most arduous and responsible under the Government . It falls but little , if any , short of a Cabinet position in its importance and responsibilities . I would ask for it , therefore , such legislation as in your judgment will place the office upon a footing of dignity commensurate with its importance and with the character and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it properly . As the United States is the freest of all nations , so , too , its people sympathize with all people struggling for liberty and self government but while so sympathizing it is due to our honor that we should abstain from enforcing our views upon unwilling nations and from taking an interested part , without invitation , in the quarrels between different nations or between governments and their subjects . Our course should always be in conformity with strict justice and law , international and local . Such has been the policy of the Administration in dealing with these questions . For more than a year a valuable province of Spain , and a near neighbor of ours , in whom all our people can not but feel a deep interest , has been struggling for independence and freedom . The people and Government of the United States entertain the same warm feelings and sympathies for the people of Cuba in their pending struggle that they manifested throughout the previous struggles between Spain and her former colonies in behalf of the latter . But the contest has at no time assumed the conditions which amount to a war in the sense of international law , or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insurgents sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency . The principle is maintained , however , that this nation is its own judge when to accord the rights of belligerency , either to a people struggling to free themselves from a government they believe to be oppressive or to independent nations at war with each other . The United States have no disposition to interfere with the existing relations of Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent . They believe that in due time Spain and other European powers will find their interest in terminating those relations and establishing their present dependencies as independent powers members of the family of nations . These dependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one European power to another . When the present relation of colonies ceases , they are to become independent powers , exercising the right of choice and of self control in the determination of their future condition and relations with other powers . The United States , in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba , and in the interest of a neighboring people , proposed their good offices to bring the existing contest to a termination . The offer , not being accepted by Spain on a basis which we believed could be received by Cuba , was withdrawn . It is hoped that the good offices of the United States may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife . Meanwhile a number of illegal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up . It has been the endeavor of the Administration to execute the neutrality laws in good faith , no matter how unpleasant the task , made so by the sufferings we have endured from lack of like good faith toward us by other nations . On the 26th of March last the United States schooner Lizzie Major was arrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate , and two passengers taken from it and carried as prisoners to Cuba . Representations of these facts were made to the Spanish Government as soon as official information of them reached Washington . The two passengers were set at liberty , and the Spanish Government assured the United States that the captain of the frigate in making the capture had acted without law , that he had been reprimanded for the irregularity of his conduct , and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba would not sanction any act that could violate the rights or treat with disrespect the sovereignty of this nation . The question of the seizure of the brig Mary Lowell at one of the Bahama Islands by Spanish authorities is now the subject of correspondence between this Government and those of Spain and Great Britain . The Captain General of Cuba about May last issued a proclamation authorizing search to be made of vessels on the high seas . Immediate remonstrance was made against this , whereupon the Captain General issued a new proclamation limiting the right of search to vessels of the United States so far as authorized under the treaty of 1795 . This proclamation , however , was immediately withdrawn . I have always felt that the most intimate relations should be cultivated between the Republic of the United States and all independent nations on this continent . It may be well worth considering whether new treaties between us and them may not be profitably entered into , to secure more intimate relations friendly , commercial , and otherwise . The subject of an interoceanic canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Isthmus of Darien is one in which commerce is greatly interested . Instructions have been given to our minister to the Republic of the United States of Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a survey by this Government , in order to determine the practicability of such an undertaking , and a charter for the right of way to build , by private enterprise , such a work , if the survey proves it to be practicable . In order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixed commission at Lima for the adjustment of claims , it became necessary to send a commissioner and secretary to Lima in August last . No appropriation having been made by Congress for this purpose , it is now asked that one be made covering the past and future expenses of the commission . The good offices of the United States to bring about a peace between Spain and the South American Republics with which she is at war having been accepted by Spain , Peru , and Chile , a congress has been invited to be held in Washington during the present winter . A grant has been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit over the territory of Nicaragua , to which Costa Rico has given its assent , which , it is alleged , conflicts with vested rights of citizens of the United States . The Department of State has now this subject under consideration . The minister of Peru having made representations that there was a state of war between Peru and Spain , and that Spain was constructing , in and near New York , thirty gunboats , which might be used by Spain in such a way as to relieve the naval force at Cuba , so as to operate against Peru , orders were given to prevent their departure . No further steps having been taken by the representative of the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure of these vessels , and I not feeling authorized to detain the property of a nation with which we are at peace on a mere Executive order , the matter has been referred to the courts to decide . The conduct of the war between the allies and the Republic of Paraguay has made the intercourse with that country so difficult that it has been deemed advisable to withdraw our representative from there . Toward the close of the last Administration a convention was signed at London for the settlement of all outstanding claims between Great Britain and the United States , which failed to receive the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification . The time and the circumstances attending the negotiation of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by the people of the United States , and its provisions were wholly inadequate for the settlement of the grave wrongs that bad been sustained by this Government , as well as by its citizens . The injuries resulting to the United States by reason of the course adopted by Great Britain during our late civil war in the increased rates of insurance in the diminution of exports and imports , and other obstructions to domestic industry and production in its effect upon the foreign commerce of the country in the decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine in the prolongation of the war and the increased cost both in treasure and in lives of its suppression could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial claims , which continually arise between commercial nations and yet the convention treated them simply as such ordinary claims , from which they differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in the magnitude of their amount , great even as is that difference . Not a word was found in the treaty , and not an inference could be drawn from it , to remove the sense of the unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in our struggle for existence , which had so deeply and universally impressed itself upon the people of this country . Believing that a convention thus misconceived in its scope and inadequate in its provisions would not have produced the hearty , cordial settlement of pending questions , which alone is consistent with the relations which I desire to have firmly established between the United States and Great Britain , I regarded the action of the Senate in rejecting the treaty to have been wisely taken in the interest of peace and as a necessary step in the direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two countries . A sensitive people , conscious of their power , are more at ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of a settlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their grave sense of the grievance they have sustained . The rejection of the treaty was followed by a state of public feeling on both sides which I thought not favorable to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations . I accordingly so instructed the minister of the United States to Great Britain , and found that my views in this regard were shared by Her Majesty s ministers . I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two Governments can approach the solution of this momentous question with an appreciation of what is due to the rights , dignity , and honor of each , and with the determination not only to remove the causes of complaint in the past , but to lay the foundation of a broad principle of public law which will prevent future differences and tend to firm and continued peace and friendship . This is now the only grave question which the United States has with any foreign nation . The question of renewing a treaty for reciprocal trade between the United States and the British Provinces on this continent has not been favorably considered by the Administration . The advantages of such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the British producer . Except , possibly , a few engaged in the trade between the two sections , no citizen of the United States would be benefited by reciprocity . Our internal taxation would prove a protection to the British producer almost equal to the protection which our manufacturers now receive from the tariff . Some arrangement , however , for the regulation of commercial intercourse between the United States and the Dominion of Canada may be desirable . The commission for adjusting the claims of the Hudsons Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural Company upon the United States has terminated its labors . The award of 650 , 000 has been made and all rights and titles of the company on the territory of the United States have been extinguished . Deeds for the property of the company have been delivered . An appropriation by Congress to meet this sum is asked . The commissioners for determining the northwestern land boundary between the United States and the British possessions under the treaty of 1856 have completed their labors , and the commission has been dissolved . In conformity with the recommendation of Congress , a proposition was early made to the British Government to abolish the mixed courts created under the treaty of April 7 , 1862 , for the suppression of the slave trade . The subject is still under negotiation . It having come to my knowledge that a corporate company , organized under British laws , proposed to land upon the shores of the United States and to operate there a submarine cable , under a concession from His Majesty the Emperor of the French of an exclusive right for twenty years of telegraphic communication between the shores of France and the United States , with the very objectionable feature of subjecting all messages conveyed thereby to the scrutiny and control of the French Government , I caused the French and British legations at Washington to be made acquainted with the probable policy of Congress on this subject , as foreshadowed by the bill which passed the Senate in March last . This drew from the representatives of the company an agreement to accept as the basis of their operations the provisions of that bill , or of such other enactment on the subject as might be passed during the approaching session of Congress also , to use their influence to secure from the French Government a modification of their concession , so as to permit the landing upon French soil of any cable belonging to any company incorporated by the authority of the United States or of any State in the Union , and , on their part , not to oppose the establishment of any such cable . In consideration of this agreement I directed the withdrawal of all opposition by the United States authorities to the landing of the cable and to the working of it until the meeting of Congress . I regret to say that there has been no modification made in the company s concession , nor , so far as I can learn , have they attempted to secure one . Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens of the United States from competition upon the shores of France . I recommend legislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States , as well as the dignity and sovereignty of the nation , against such an assumption . I shall also endeavor to secure , by negotiation , an abandonment of the principle of monopolies in ocean telegraphic cables . Copies of this correspondence are herewith furnished . The unsettled political condition of other countries , less fortunate than our own , sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of becoming naturalized . Having secured this , they return to their native country and reside there , without disclosing their change of allegiance . They accept official positions of trust or honor , which can only be held by citizens of their native land they journey under passports describing them as such citizens and it is only when civil discord , after perhaps years of quiet , threatens their persons or their property , or when their native state drafts them into its military service , that the fact of their change of allegiance is made known . They reside permanently away from the United States , they contribute nothing to its revenues , they avoid the duties of its citizenship , and they only make themselves known by a claim of protection . I have directed the diplomatic and consular officers of the United States to scrutinize carefully all such claims for protection . The citizen of the United States , whether native or adopted , who discharges his duty to his country , is entitled to its complete protection . While I have a voice in the direction of affairs I shall not consent to imperil this sacred right by conferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants . On the accession of the present Administration it was found that the minister for North Germany had made propositions for the negotiation of a convention for the protection of emigrant passengers , to which no response had been given . It was concluded that to be effectual all the maritime powers engaged in the trade should join in such a measure . Invitations have been extended to the cabinets of London , Paris , Florence , Berlin , Brussels , The Hague , Copenhagen , and Stockholm to empower their representatives at Washington to simultaneously enter into negotiations and to conclude with the United States conventions identical in form , making uniform regulations as to the construction of the parts of vessels to be devoted to the use of emigrant passengers , as to the quality and quantity of food , as to the medical treatment of the sick , and as to the rules to be observed during the voyage , in order to secure ventilation , to promote health , to prevent intrusion , and to protect the females and providing for the establishment of tribunals in the several countries for enforcing such regulations by summary process . Your attention is respectfully called to the law regulating the tariff on Russian hemp , and to the question whether to fix the charges on Russian hemp higher than they are fixed upon manila is not a violation of our treaty with Russia placing her products upon the same footing with those of the most favored nations . Our manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under the encouragement which they now receive . With the improvements in machinery already effected , and still increasing , causing machinery to take the place of skilled labor to a large extent , our imports of many articles must fall off largely within a very few years . Fortunately , too , manufactures are not confined to a few localities , as formerly , and it is to be hoped will become more and more diffused , making the interest in them equal in all sections . They give employment and support to hundreds of thousands of people at home , and retain with us the means which otherwise would be shipped abroad . The extension of railroads in Europe and the East is bringing into competition with our agricultural products like products of other countries . Self interest , if not self preservation , therefore dictates caution against disturbing any industrial interest of the country . It teaches us also the necessity of looking to other markets for the sale of our surplus . Our neighbors south of us and China and Japan , should receive our special attention . It will be the endeavor of the Administration to cultivate such relations with all these nations as to entitle us to their confidence and make it their interest , as well as ours , to establish better commercial relations . Through the agency of a more enlightened policy than that heretofore pursued toward China , largely due to the sagacity and efforts of one of our own distinguished citizens , the world is about to commence largely increased relations with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation . As the United States have been the initiators in this new policy , so they should be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it a success . In this connection I advise such legislation as will forever preclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon our soil under the name of coolies , and also prevent American vessels from engaging in the transportation of coolies to any country tolerating the system . I also recommend that the mission to China be raised to one of the first class . On my assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of the United States it was with the conviction that three things were essential to its peace , prosperity , and fullest development . First among these is strict integrity in fulfilling all our obligations second , to secure protection to the person and property of the citizen of the United States in each and every portion of our common country , wherever he may choose to move , without reference to original nationality , religion , color , or politics , demanding of him only obedience to the laws and proper respect for the rights of others third , union of all the States , with equal rights , indestructible by any constitutional means . To secure the first of these , Congress has taken two essential steps First , in declaring by joint resolution that the public debt shall be paid , principal and interest , in coin and , second , by providing the means for paying . Providing the means , however , could not secure the object desired without a proper administration of the laws for the collection of the revenues and an economical disbursement of them . To this subject the Administration has most earnestly addressed itself , with results , I hope , satisfactory to the country . There has been no hesitation in changing officials in order to secure an efficient execution of the laws , sometimes , too , when , in a mere party view , undesirable political results were likely to follow nor any hesitation in sustaining efficient officials against remonstrances wholly political . It may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from leaving on the statute books the so called tenure of office acts , and to earnestly recommend their total repeal . It could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution , when providing that appointments made by the President should receive the consent of the Senate , that the latter should have the power to retain in office persons placed there by Federal appointment against the will of the President . The law is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of the Government . What faith can an Executive put in officials forced upon him , and those , too , whom he has suspended for reason How will such officials be likely to serve an Administration which they know does not trust them For the second requisite to our growth and prosperity time and a firm but humane administration of existing laws amended from time to time as they may prove ineffective or prove harsh and unnecessary are probably all that are required . The third can not be attained by special legislation , but must be regarded as fixed by the Constitution itself and gradually acquiesced in by force of public opinion . From the foundation of the Government to the present the management of the original inhabitants of this continent the Indians has been a subject of embarrassment and expense , and has been attended with continuous robberies , murders , and wars . From my own experience upon the frontiers and in Indian countries , I do not hold either legislation or the conduct of the whites who come most in contact with the Indian blameless for these hostilities . The past , however , can not be undone , and the question must be met as we now find it . I have attempted a new policy toward these wards of the nation they can not be regarded in any other light than as wards , with fair results so far as tried , and which I hope will be attended ultimately with great success . The Society of Friends is well known as having succeeded in living in peace with the Indians in the early settlement of Pennsylvania , while their white neighbors of other sects in other sections were constantly embroiled . They are also known for their opposition to all strife , violence , and war , and are generally noted for their strict integrity and fair dealings . These considerations induced me to give the management of a few reservations of Indians to them and to throw the burden of the selection of agents upon the society itself . The result has proven most satisfactory . It will be found more fully set forth in the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs . For superintendents and Indian agents not on the reservations , officers of the Army were selected . The reasons for this are numerous . Where Indian agents are sent , there , or near there , troops must be sent also . The agent and the commander of troops are independent of each other , and are subject to orders from different Departments of the Government . The army officer holds a position for life the agent , one at the will of the President . The former is personally interested in living in harmony with the Indian and in establishing a permanent peace , to the end that some portion of his life may be spent within the limits of civilized society the latter has no such personal interest . Another reason is an economic one and still another , the hold which the Government has upon a life officer to secure a faithful discharge of duties in carrying out a given policy . The building of railroads , and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of the country , is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of Indians . No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines , the fact is they do not harmonize well , and one or the other has to give way in the end . A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itself the wrath of all Christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard for human life and the rights of others , dangerous to society . I see no substitute for such a system , except in placing all the Indians on large reservations , as rapidly as it can be done , and giving them absolute protection there . As soon as they are fitted for it they should be induced to take their lands in severalty and to set up Territorial governments for their own protection . For full details on this subject I call your special attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs . The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Department for the year ending June 30 , 1869 , to be 80 , 644 , 042 , of which 23 , 882 , 310 was disbursed in the payment of debts contracted during the war , and is not chargeable to current army expenses . His estimate of 34 , 531 , 031 for the expenses of the Army for the next fiscal year is as low as it is believed can be relied on . The estimates of bureau officers have been carefully scrutinized , and reduced wherever it has been deemed practicable . If , however , the condition of the country should be such by the beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a greater concentration of troops , the appropriation asked for will not be expended . The appropriations estimated for river and harbor improvements and for fortifications are submitted separately . Whatever amount Congress may deem proper to appropriate for these purposes will be expended . The recommendation of the General of the Army that appropriations be made for the forts at Boston . Portland , New York , Philadelphia , New Orleans , and San Francisco , if for no other , is concurred in . I also ask your special attention to the recommendation of the general commanding the Military Division of the Pacific for the sale of the seal islands of Paul and George , Alaska Territory , and suggest that it either be complied with or that legislation be had for the protection of the seal fisheries from which a revenue should be derived . The report of the Secretary of War contains a synopsis of the reports of the heads of bureaus , of the commanders of military divisions , and of the districts of Virginia , Mississippi , and Texas , and the report of the General of the Army in full . The recommendations therein contained have been well considered , and are submitted for your action . however , call special attention to the recommendation of the Chief of Ordnance for the sale of arsenals and lands no longer of use to the Government also , to the recommendation of the Secretary of War that the act of 3d March , 1869 , prohibiting promotions and appointments in the staff corps of the Army , be repealed . The extent of country to be garrisoned and the number of military posts to be occupied is the same with a reduced Army as with a large one . The number of staff officers required is more dependent upon the latter than the former condition . The report of the Secretary of the Navy accompanying this shows the condition of the Navy when this Administration came into office and the changes made since . Strenuous efforts have been made to place as many vessels in commission , or render them fit for service if required , as possible , and to substitute the sail for steam while cruising , thus materially reducing the expenses of the Navy and adding greatly to its efficiency . Looking to our future , I recommend a liberal , though not extravagant , policy toward this branch of the public service . The report of the Postmaster General furnishes a clear and comprehensive exhibit of the operations of the postal service and of the financial condition of the Post Office Department . The ordinary postal revenues for the year ending the 30th of June , 1869 , amounted to 18 , 344 , 510 , and the expenditures to 23 , 698 , 131 , showing an excess of expenditures over receipts of 5 , 353 , 620 . The excess of expenditures over receipts for the previous year amounted to 6 , 437 , 992 . The increase of revenues for 1869 over those of 1868 was 2 , 051 , 909 , and the increase of expenditures was 967 , 538 . The increased revenue in 1869 exceeded the increased revenue in 1868 by 996 , 336 , and the increased expenditure in 1869 was 2 , 527 , 570 less than the increased expenditure in 1868 , showing by comparison this gratifying feature of improvement , that while the increase of expenditures over the increase of receipts in 1868 was 2 , 439 , 535 , the increase of receipts over the increase of expenditures in 1869 was 1 , 084 , 371 . Your attention is respectfully called to the recommendations made by the Postmaster General for authority to change the rate of compensation to the main trunk railroad lines for their services in carrying the mails for having post route maps executed for reorganizing and increasing the efficiency of the special agency service for increase of the mail service on the Pacific , and for establishing mail service , under the flag of the Union , on the Atlantic and most especially do I call your attention to his recommendation for the total abolition of the franking privilege . This is an abuse from which no one receives a commensurate advantage it reduces the receipts for postal service from 25 to 30 per cent and largely increases the service to be performed . The method by which postage should be paid upon public matter is set forth fully in the report of the Postmaster General . The report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that the quantity of public lands disposed of during the year ending the 30th of June , 1869 , was 7 , 666 , 152 acres , exceeding that of the preceding year by 1 , 010 , 409 acres . Of this amount 2 , 899 , 544 acres were sold for cash and 2 , 737 , 365 acres entered under the homestead laws . The remainder was granted to aid in the construction of works of internal improvement , approved to the States as swamp land , and located with warrants and scrip . The cash receipts from all sources were 4 , 472 , 886 , exceeding those of the preceding year 2 , 840 , 140 . During the last fiscal year 23 , 196 names were added to the pension rolls and 4 , 876 dropped therefrom , leaving at its close 187 , 963 . The amount paid to pensioners , including the compensation of disbursing agents , was 28 , 422 , 884 , an increase of 4 , 411 , 902 on that of the previous year . The munificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in its legislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recent struggle to maintain that unity of government which makes us one people . The additions to the pension rolls of each successive year since the conclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the repeated amendments of the act of the 14th of July , 1862 , which extended its provisions to cases not falling within its original scope . The large outlay which is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance bestowed since that date upon those who in the line of duty were wholly or permanently disabled . Public opinion has given an emphatic sanction to these measures of Congress , and it will be conceded that no part of our public burden is more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by this branch of the service . It necessitates for the next fiscal year , in addition to the amount justly chargeable to the naval pension fund , an appropriation of 30 , 000 , 000 . During the year ending the 30th of September , 1869 , the Patent Office issued 13 , 762 patents , and its receipts were 686 , 389 , being 213 , 926 more than the expenditures . I would respectfully call your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of supervising the education of freedmen with the other duties devolving upon the Commissioner of Education . If it is the desire of Congress to make the census which must be taken during the year 1870 more complete and perfect than heretofore , I would suggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon . As Congress at the last session appointed a committee to take into consideration such measures as might be deemed proper in reference to the census and report a plan , I desist from saying more . I recommend to your favorable consideration the claims of the Agricultural Bureau for liberal appropriations . In a country so diversified in climate and soil as ours , and with a population so largely dependent upon agriculture , the benefits that can be conferred by properly fostering this Bureau are incalculable . I desire respectfully to call the attention of Congress to the inadequate salaries of a number of the most important offices of the Government . In this message I will not enumerate them , but will specify only the justices of the Supreme Court . No change has been made in their salaries for fifteen years . Within that time the labors of the court have largely increased and the expenses of living have at least doubled . During the same time Congress has twice found it necessary to increase largely the compensation of its own members , and the duty which it owes to another department of the Government deserves , and will undoubtedly receive , its due consideration . There are many subjects not alluded to in this message which might with propriety be introduced , but I abstain , believing that your patriotism and statesmanship will suggest the topics and the legislation most conducive to the interests of the whole people . On my part I promise a rigid adherence to the laws and their strict enforcement .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States Senate bill No . 1044 , to provide for the resumption of specie payments , is before me , and this day receives my signature of approval . I venture upon this unusual method of conveying the notice of approval to the House in which the measure originated because of its great importance to the country at large and in order to suggest further legislation which seems to me essential to make this law effective . It is a subject of congratulation that a measure has become law which fixes a date when specie resumption shall commence and implies an obligation on the part of Congress , if in its power , to give such legislation as may prove necessary to redeem this promise . To this end I respectfully call your attention to a few suggestions First . The necessity of an increased revenue to carry out the obligation of adding to the sinking fund annually 1 per cent of the public debt , amounting now to about 34 , 000 , 000 per annum , and to carry out the promises of this measure to redeem , under certain contingencies , eighty millions of the present legal tenders , and , without contingency , the fractional currency now in circulation . How to increase the surplus revenue is for Congress to devise , but I will venture to suggest that the duty on tea and coffee might be restored without permanently enhancing the cost to the consumers , and that the 10 per cent horizontal reduction of the tariff on articles specified in the law of June 6 , 1872 , be repealed . The supply of tea and coffee already on hand in the United States would in all probability be advanced in price by adopting this measure . But it is known that the adoption of free entry to those articles of necessity did not cheapen them , but merely added to the profits of the countries producing them , or of the middlemen in those countries , who have the exclusive trade in them . Second . The first section of the bill now under consideration provides that the fractional currency shall be redeemed in silver coin as rapidly as practicable . There is no provision preventing the fluctuation in the value of the paper currency . With gold at a premium of anything over 10 per cent above the currency in use , it is probable , almost certain , that silver would be bought up for exportation as fast as it was put out , or until change would become so scarce as to make the premium on it equal to the premium on gold , or sufficiently high to make it no longer profitable to buy for export , thereby causing a direct loss to the community at large and great embarrassment to trade . As the present law commands final resumption on the 1st day of January , 1879 , and as the gold receipts by the Treasury are larger than the gold payments and the currency receipts are smaller than the currency payments , thereby making monthly sales of gold necessary to meet current currency expenses , it occurs to me that these difficulties might be remedied by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem legal tender notes , whenever presented in sums of not less than 100 and multiples thereof , at a premium for gold of 10 per cent , less interest at the rate of 2 1 2 per cent per annum from the 1st day of January , 1875 , to the date of putting this law into operation , and diminishing this premium at the same rate until final resumption , changing the rate of premium demanded from time to time as the interest amounts to one quarter of 1 per cent . I suggest this rate of interest because it would bring currency at par with gold at the date fixed by law for final resumption . I suggest 10 per cent as the demand premium at the beginning because I believe this rate would insure the retention of silver in the country for change . The provisions of the third section of the act will prevent combinations being made to exhaust the Treasury of coin . With such a law it is presumable that no gold would be called for not required for legitimate business purposes . When large amounts of coin should be drawn from the Treasury , correspondingly large amounts of currency would be withdrawn from circulation , thus causing a sufficient stringency in currency to stop the outward flow of coin . The advantages of a currency of a fixed known value would also be reached . In my opinion , by the enactment of such a law business and industries would revive and the beginning of prosperity on a firm basis would be reached . Other means of increasing revenue than those suggested should probably be devised , and also other legislation . In fact , to carry out the first section of the act another mint becomes a necessity . With the present facilities for coinage , it would take a period probably beyond that fixed by law for final specie resumption to coin the silver necessary to transact the business of the country . There are now smelting furnaces , for extracting the silver and gold from the ores brought from the mountain territories , in Chicago , Louis , and Omaha three in the former city and as much of the change required will be wanted in the Mississippi Valley States , and as the metals to be coined come from west of those States , and , as I understand , the charges for transportation of bullion from either of the cities named to the mint in Philadelphia or to New York City amount to 4 for each 1 , 000 worth , with an equal expense for transportation back , it would seem a fair argument in favor of adopting one or more of those cities as the place or places for the establishment of new coining facilities . I have ventured upon this subject with great diffidence , because it is so unusual to approve a measure as I most heartily do this , even if no further legislation is attainable at this time and to announce the fact by message . But I do so because I feel that it is a subject of such vital importance to the whole country that it should receive the attention of and be discussed by Congress and the people through the press , and in every way , to the end that the best and most satisfactory course may be reached of executing what I deem most beneficial legislation on a most vital question to the interests and prosperity of the nation .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I transmit to the Senate , in answer to their resolution of the 7th instant , a report from the Secretary of State , with accompanying documents . GRANT . DEPARTMENT OF STATE , Washington , July 14 , 1870 . The Secretary of State , to whom was referred the resolution of the Senate requesting the President to institute an inquiry , by such means as in his judgment shall be deemed proper , into the present condition of the commercial relations between the United States and the Spanish American States on this continent , and between those countries and other nations , and to communicate to the Senate full and complete statements regarding the same , together with such recommendations as he may think necessary to promote the development and increase of our commerce with those regions and to secure to the United States that proportionate share of the trade of this continent to which their close relations of geographical contiguity and political friendship with all the States of America justly entitle them , has the honor to report The resolution justly regards the commercial and the political relations of the United States with the American States of Spanish origin as necessarily dependent upon each other . If the commerce of those countries has been diverted from its natural connection with the United States , the fact may probably be partly traced to political causes , which have been swept away by the great civil convulsion in this country . For the just comprehension of the position of this Government in the American political system , and for the causes which have failed to give it hitherto the influence to which it is properly entitled by reason of its democratic system and of the moderation and sense of justice which have distinguished its foreign policy through successive Administrations from the birth of the nation until now , it is necessary to make a brief notice of such measures as affect our present relations to the other parts of this continent . The United States were the first of the European colonies in America to arrive at maturity as a people and assume the position of an independent republic . Since then important changes have taken place in various nations and in every part of the world . Our own growth in power has been not the least remarkable of all the great events of modern history . When , at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War , having conquered by arms our right to exist as a sovereign state , that right was at length recognized by treaties , we occupied only a narrow belt of land along the Atlantic coast , hemmed in at the north , the west , and the south by the possessions of European Governments , or by uncultivated wastes beyond the Alleghanies , inhabited only by the aborigines . But in the very infancy of the United States far sighted statesmen saw and predicted that , weak in population and apparently restricted in available territory as the new Republic then was , it had within it the germs of colossal grandeur , and would at no remote day occupy the continent of America with its institutions , its authority , and its peaceful influence . That expectation has been thus far signally verified . The United States entered at once into the occupation of their rightful possessions westward to the banks of the Mississippi . Next , by the spontaneous proffer of France , they acquired Louisiana and its territorial extension , or right of extension , north to the line of the treaty demarcation between France and Great Britain , and west to the Pacific Ocean . Next , by amicable arrangement with Spain , they acquired the Floridas , and complete southern maritime frontiers upon the Gulf of Mexico . Then came the union with the independent State of Texas , followed by the acquisitions of California and New Mexico , and then of Arizona . Finally , Russia has ceded to us Alaska , and the continent of North America has become independent of Europe , except so much of it as continues to maintain political relations with Great Britain . Meanwhile , partly by natural increase and partly by voluntary immigration from Europe , our population has risen from 3 , 000 , 000 to nearly 40 , 000 , 000 the number of States and Territories united under the Constitution has been augmented from thirteen to forty seven the development of internal wealth and power has kept pace with political expansion we have occupied in part and peopled the vast interior of the continent we have bound the Pacific to the Atlantic by a chain of intervening States and organized Territories we have delivered the Republic from the anomaly and the ignominy of domestic servitude we have constitutionally fixed the equality of all races and of all men before the law and we have established , at the cost of a great civil war a cost , however , not beyond the value of such a result the indissoluble national unity of the United States . In all these marked stages of national progress , from the Declaration of Independence to the recent amendments of the Constitution , it is impossible not to perceive a providential series and succession of events , intimately attached one to the other , and possessed of definite character as a whole , whatever incidental departures from such uniformity may have marked , or seemed to mark , our foreign policy under the influence of temporary causes or of the conflicting opinions of statesmen . In the time of Washington , of the first Adams , of Jefferson , and of Madison the condition of Europe , engaged in the gigantic wars of the French Revolution and of the Empire , produced its series of public questions and gave tone and color to our foreign policy . In the time of Monroe , of the second Adams , and of Jackson , and subsequently thereto , the independence of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies of America produced its series of questions and its apparent modification of our public policy . Domestic questions of territorial organization , of social emancipation , and of national unity have also largely occupied the minds and the attention of the later Administrations . The treaties of alliance and guaranty with France , which contributed so much to our independence , were one source of solicitude to the early Administrations , which were endeavoring to protect our commerce from the depredations and wrongs to which the maritime policy of England and the reaction of that policy on France subjected it . For twenty years we struggled in vain to accomplish this , and at last drifted into war . The avoidance of entangling alliances , the characteristic feature of the foreign policy of Washington , sprang from this condition of things . But the entangling alliances which then existed were engagements made with France as a part of the general contract under which aid was furnished to us for the achievement of our independence . France was willing to waive the letter of the obligation as to her West India possessions , but demanded in its stead privileges in our ports which the Administration was unwilling to concede . To make its refusal acceptable to a public which sympathized with France , the Cabinet of General Washington exaggerated the principle into a theory tending to national isolation . The public measures designed to maintain unimpaired the domestic sovereignty and the international neutrality of the United States were independent of this policy , though apparently incidental to it . The municipal laws enacted by Congress then and since have been but declarations of the law of nations . They are essential to the preservation of our national dignity and honor they have for their object to repress and punish all enterprises of private war , one of the last relics of mediaeval barbarism and they have descended to us from the fathers of the Republic , supported and enforced by every succeeding President of the United States . The foreign policy of these early days was not a narrow one . During this period we secured the evacuation by Great Britain of the country wrongfully occupied by her on the Lakes we acquired Louisiana we measured forces on the sea with France , and on the land and sea with England we set the example of resisting and chastising the piracies of the Barbary States we initiated in negotiations with Prussia the long line of treaties for the liberalization of war and the promotion of international intercourse and we steadily demanded , and at length obtained , indemnification from various governments for the losses we had suffered by foreign spoliations in the wars of Europe . To this point in our foreign policy we had arrived when the revolutionary movements in Spanish and Portuguese America compelled a modification of our relations with Europe , in consequence of the rise of new and independent states in America . The revolution which commenced in 1810 , and extended through all the Spanish American continental colonies , after vain efforts of repression on the part of Spain , protracted through twenty years , terminated in the establishment of the independent States of Mexico , Guatemala , San Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Chile , Bolivia , the Argentine Republic , Uruguay , and Paraguay , to which the Empire of Brazil came in time to be added . These events necessarily enlarged the sphere of action of the United States , and essentially modified our relations with Europe and our attitude to the rest of this continent . The new States were , like ourselves , revolted colonies . They continued the precedent we had set , of separating from Europe . Their assumption of independence was stimulated by our example . They professedly imitated us , and copied our National Constitution , sometimes even to their inconvenience . The Spanish American colonies had not the same preparation for independence that we had . Each of the British colonies possessed complete local autonomy . Its formal transition from dependence to independence consisted chiefly in expelling the British governor of the colony and electing a governor of the State , from which to the organized Union was but a step . All these conditions of success were wanting in Spanish America , and hence many of the difficulties in their career as independent states and , further , while the revolution in British America was the exclusive result of the march of opinion in the British colonies , the simultaneous action of the separate Spanish colonies , though showing a desire for independence , was principally produced by the accident of the invasion of Spain by France . The formation of these new sovereignties in America was important to us , not only because of the cessation of colonial monopolies to that extent , but because of the geographical relations to us held by so many new nations , all , like ourselves , created from European stock and interested in excluding European politics , dynastic questions , and balances of power from further influence in the New World . Thus the United States were forced into new lines of action , which , though apparently in some respects conflicting , were really in harmony with the line marked out by Washington . The avoidance of entangling political alliances and the maintenance of our own independent neutrality became doubly important from the fact that they became applicable to the new Republics as well as to the mother country . The duty of noninterference had been admitted by every President . The question came up in the time of the first Adams , on the occasion of the enlistment projects of Miranda . It appeared again under Jefferson anterior to the revolt of the Spanish colonies in the schemes of Aaron Burr . It was an ever present question in the Administrations of Madison , Monroe , and the younger Adams , in reference to the questions of foreign enlistment or equipment in the United States , and when these new Republics entered the family of nations , many of them very feeble , and all too much subject to internal revolution and civil war , a strict adherence to our previous policy and a strict enforcement of our laws became essential to the preservation of friendly relations with them for since that time it has been one of the principal cares of those intrusted with the administration of the Government to prevent piratical expeditions against these sister Republics from leaving our ports . And thus the changed condition of the New World made no change in the traditional and peaceful policy of the United States in this respect . In one respect , however , the advent of these new States in America did compel an apparent change of foreign policy on our part . It devolved upon us the determination of the great international question at what time and under what circumstances to recognize a new power as entitled to a place among the family of nations . There was but little of precedent to guide us , except our own case . Something , indeed , could be inferred from the historical origin of the Netherlands and Switzerland . But our own case , carefully and conscientiously considered , was sufficient to guide us to right conclusions . We maintained our position of international friendship and of treaty obligations toward Spain , but we did not consider that we were bound to wait for its recognition of the new Republics before admitting them into treaty relations with us as sovereign states . We held that it was for us to judge whether or not they had attained to the condition of actual independence , and the consequent right of recognition by us . We considered this question of fact deliberately and coolly . We sent commissioners to Spanish America to ascertain and report for our information concerning their actual circumstances , and in the fullness of time we acknowledged their independence we exchanged diplomatic ministers , and made treaties of amity with them , the earliest of which , negotiated by John Quincy Adams , served as the model for the subsequent treaties with the Spanish American Republics . We also , simultaneously therewith , exerted our good offices with Spain to induce her to submit to the inevitable result and herself to accept and acknowledge the independence of her late colonies . We endeavored to induce Russia to join us in these representations . In all this our action was positive , in the direction of promoting the complete political separation of America from Europe . A vast field was thus opened to the statesmen of the United States for the peaceful introduction , the spread , and the permanent establishment of the American ideas of republican government , of modification of the laws of war , of liberalization of commerce , of religious freedom and toleration , and of the emancipation of the New World from the dynastic and balance of power controversies of Europe . John Quincy Adams , beyond any other statesman of the time in this country , had the knowledge and experience , both European and American , the comprehension of thought and purpose , and the moral convictions which peculiarly fitted him to introduce our country into this new field and to lay the foundation of an American policy . The declaration known as the Monroe doctrine , and the objects and purposes of the congress of Panama , both supposed to have been largely inspired by Adams , have influenced public events from that day to this as a principle of government for this continent and its adjacent islands . It was at the period of the congress of Aix la Chapelle and of Laybach , when the Holy Alliance was combined to arrest all political changes in Europe in the sense of liberty , when they were intervening in southern Europe for the reestablishment of absolutism , and when they were meditating interference to check the progress of free government in America , that Monroe , in his annual message of December , 1823 , declared that the United States would consider any attempt to extend the European system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety . With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power , he said , we have not interfered and shall not interfere but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it , and whose independence we have , on great consideration and on just principles , acknowledged , we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them , or controlling in any other manner their destiny , by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States . This declaration resolved the solution of the immediate question of the independence of the Spanish American colonies , and is supposed to have exercised some influence upon the course of the British cabinet in regard to the absolutist schemes in Europe as well as in America . It has also exercised a permanent influence on this continent . It was at once invoked in consequence of the supposed peril of Cuba on the side of Europe it was applied to a similar danger threatening Yucatan it was embodied in the treaty of the United States and Great Britain as to Central America it produced the successful opposition of the United States to the attempt of Great Britain to exercise dominion in Nicaragua under the cover of the Mosquito Indians and it operated in like manner to prevent the establishment of a European dynasty in Mexico . The United States stand solemnly committed by repeated declarations and repeated acts to this doctrine , and its application to the affairs of this continent . In his message to the two Houses of Congress at the commencement of the present session the President , following the teachings of all our history , said that the existing dependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one European power to another . When the present relation of colonies ceases , they are to become independent powers , exercising the right of choice and of self control in the determination of their future condition and relations with other powers . This policy is not a policy of aggression but it opposes the creation of European dominion on American soil , or its transfer to other European powers , and it looks hopefully to the time when , by the voluntary departure of European Governments from this continent and the adjacent islands , America shall be wholly American . It does not contemplate forcible intervention in any legitimate contest , but it protests against permitting such a contest to result in the increase of European power or influence and it ever impels this Government , as in the late contest between the South American Republics and Spain , to interpose its good offices to secure an honorable peace . The congress of Panama was planned by Bolivar to secure the union of Spanish America against Spain . It had originally military as well as political purposes . In the military objects the United States could take no part and , indeed , the necessity for such objects ceased when the full effects of Monroe s declarations were felt . But the pacific objects of the congress the establishment of close and cordial relations of amity , the creation of commercial intercourse , of interchange of political thought , and of habits of good understanding between the new Republics and the United States and their respective citizens might perhaps have been attained had the Administration of that day received the united support of the country . Unhappily , they were lost the new States were removed from the sympathetic and protecting influence of our example , and their commerce , which we might then have secured , passed into other hands , unfriendly to the United States . In looking back upon the Panama congress from this length of time it is easy to understand why the earnest and patriotic men who endeavored to crystallize an American system for this continent failed . Clay and Adams were far sighted statesmen , but , unfortunately , they struck against the rock of African slavery . One of the questions proposed for discussion in the conference was the consideration of the means to be adopted for the entire abolition of the African slave trade , to which proposition the committee of the United States Senate of that day replied The United States have not certainly the right , and ought never to feel the inclination , to dictate to others who may differ with them upon this subject nor do the committee see the expediency of insulting other states with whom we are maintaining relations of perfect amity by ascending the moral chair and proclaiming from thence mere abstract principles , of the rectitude of which each nation enjoys the perfect right of deciding for itself . The same committee also alluded to the possibility that the condition of the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico , still the possessions of Spain and still slaveholding , might be made the subject of discussion and of contemplated action by the Panama congress . If ever the United States , they said , permit themselves to be associated with these nations in any general congress assembled for the discussion of common plans in any way affecting European interests , they will by such act not only deprive themselves of the ability they now possess of rendering useful assistance to the other American States , but also produce other effects prejudicial to their own interests . Thus the necessity at that day of preserving the great interest of the Southern States in African slavery , and of preventing a change in the character of labor in the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico , lost to the United States the opportunity of giving a permanent direction to the political and commercial connections of the newly enfranchised Spanish American States , and their trade passed into hands unfriendly to the United States , and has remained there ever since . Events subsequent to that date have tended to place us in a position to retrieve our mistakes , among which events may be particularly named the suppression of the rebellion , the manifestation of our undeveloped and unexpected military power , the retirement of the French from Mexico , and the abolition of slavery in the United States . There is good reason to believe that the latter fact has had an important influence in our favor in Spanish America . It has caused us to be regarded there with more sympathetic as well as more respectful consideration . It has relieved those Republics from the fear of filibusterism which had been formerly incited against Central America and Mexico in the interest of slave extension , and it has produced an impression of the stability of our institutions and of our public strength sufficient to dissipate the fears of our friends or the hopes of those who wish us ill . Thus there exists in the Spanish American Republics confidence toward the United States . On our side they find a feeling of cordial amity and friendship , and a desire to cultivate and develop our common interests on this continent . With some of these States our relations are more intimate than with others , either by reason of closer similarity of constitutional forms , of greater commercial intercourse , of proximity in fact , or of the construction or contemplated construction of lines of transit for our trade and commerce between the Atlantic and the Pacific . With several of them we have peculiar treaty relations . The treaty of 1846 between the United States and New Granada contains stipulations of guaranty for the neutrality of the part of the Isthmus within the present territory of Colombia , and for the protection of the rights of sovereignty and property therein belonging to Colombia . Similar stipulations appear in the treaty of 1867 with Nicaragua , and of July , 1864 , with Honduras . Those treaties like the treaty of alliance made with France in 1778 by Franklin , Silas Deane , and Arthur Lee constitute pro tanto a true protective alliance between the United States and each of those Republics . Provisions of like effect appear in the treaty of April 19 , 1850 , between Great Britain and the United States . Brazil , with her imperial semblance and constitutional reality , has always held relations of amity with us , which have been fortified by the opening of her great rivers to commerce . It needs only that , in emulation of Russia and the United States , she should emancipate her slaves to place her in more complete sympathy with the rest of America . It will not be presumptuous , after the foregoing sketch , to say , with entire consideration for the sovereignty and national pride of the Spanish American Republics , that the United States , by the priority of their independence , by the stability of their institutions , by the regard of their people for the forms of law , by their resources as a government , by their naval power , by their commercial enterprise , by the attractions which they offer to European immigration , by the prodigious internal development of their resources and wealth , and by the intellectual life of their population , occupy of necessity a prominent position on this continent , which they neither can nor should abdicate , which entitles them to a leading voice , and which imposes upon them duties of right and of honor regarding American questions , whether those questions affect emancipated colonies or colonies still subject to European dominion . The public questions which existed as to all European colonies prior to and during the revolutions in the continental colonies of Spain and Portugal still exist with reference to the European colonies which remain and they now return upon us in full force , as we watch events in Cuba and Porto Rico . Whatever may be the result of the pending contest in Cuba , it appears to be the belief of some of the leading statesmen of Spain that the relations which now exist between the island and the mother country can not be long continued . It is understood that the resources for carrying on the struggle have been supplied mainly from Cuba , by the aid of that portion of the population which does not desire to see its political destinies intrusted to the persons who direct the movements of the insurgents but it does not follow that its political relations with Spain are to remain unchanged , or that even the party which is now dominant in the island will wish to forever continue colonists . These facts give reason to think that when the contest shall close , Cuba , with her resources strained , but unexhausted whatever may be her political relations , will resume and continue her old commercial relations with the United States and it is not impossible that at some day , not far distant when measured by the course of history , she will be called upon to elect her position in the family of nations . Although the resolution of the Senate does not in terms apply to the islands of the Antilles , it is impossible to answer it without speaking of them . They outlie the southern coast of the United States and guard the approaches to the ports of Mexico , Venezuela , and the Isthmus , by which we reach from the east the western coasts of Mexico and of the Spanish States . The people of the Spanish islands speak the language and share the traditions , customs , ideas , and religion of the Spanish American States of the continent , and will probably , like them , become at some time independent of the mother country . It would , therefore , be unwise , while shaping a commercial policy for the continent , to disregard the islands which lie so much nearer to our seaports . With the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico we maintain , in spite of their adverse legislation , a large commerce by reason of our necessities and of their proximity . In the year ending June 30 , 1869 , we imported from them merchandise valued at 65 , 609 , 274 . During the same time we sent them goods to the value only of 15 , 313 , 919 . The prohibitory duties forced upon them by the policy of Spain shut out much that we might supply . Their tropical productions , for instance , are too valuable to allow their lands to be given up to the growth of breadstuffs yet , instead of taking these articles from the superabundant fields of their nearest neighbors , they are forced to go to the distant plains of Spain . It will be for the interest of the United States to shape its general policy so that this relation of imports and exports shall be altered in Cuba when peace is restored and its political condition is satisfactorily established . With none of the other Spanish American States in North and South America are our commercial relations what they should be . Our total imports in the year ending June 30 , 1869 , from these countries were less than 25 , 000 , 000 or not one half the amount from Cuba alone , and our exports for the same time to them were only 17 , 850 , 313 and yet these countries have an aggregate population nearly or quite as great as that of the United States they have republican forms of government , and they profess to be , and probably really are , in political sympathy with us . This Department is not able to give with entire accuracy the imports and exports of Great Britain with the same countries during the corresponding period . It is believed , however , the following figures will be found to be not far from correct Imports to Great Britain , 42 , 820 , 942 exports from Great Britain , 40 , 682 , 102 . It thus appears that notwithstanding the greater distance which the commerce has to travel in coming to and from Great Britain , notwithstanding the political sympathy which ought naturally to exist between republics , notwithstanding the American idea which has been so prominently and so constantly put forward by the Government of the United States , notwithstanding the acknowledged skill of American manufacturers , notwithstanding the ready markets which the great cities of the United States afford for the consumption of tropical productions , the inhabitants of the Spanish American continent consume of the products of Great Britain more than twice the quantity they take of the products of the United States , and that they sell to us only three fifths of the amount they sell to Great Britain . The Secretary of State appends to this report the tables on which these statements are rounded . That their commerce with the United States is not large may be partially explained by the fact that these States have been subject to many successive revolutions since the failure of the congress of Panama . These revolutions not only exhaust their resources and burden them with debt , but they check emigration , prevent the flow of foreign capital into the country , and stop the enterprise which needs a stable government for its development . These suggestions are , however , applicable to the British commerce as well as to our own , and they do not explain why we , with the natural advantages in our favor , fall so far behind . The Isthmus of Panama is the common point where the commerce of the western coasts of Mexico and South America meets . When it arrives there , why should it seek Liverpool and London rather than New York The political causes which have operated to divert this commerce from us the Secretary of State has endeavored to explain . A favorable time has now come for removing them for laying the foundation of an American policy which shall bind in closer union the American Republics . Let them understand that the United States do not covet their territories that our only desire is to see them peaceful , with free and stable governments , increasing in wealth and population , and developing in the lines in which their own traditions , customs , habits , laws , and modes of thought will naturally take them . Let them feel that , as in 1826 , so now , this Government is ready to aid them to the full extent of its constitutional power in any steps which they may take for their better protection against anarchy . Let them be convinced that the United States is prepared , in good faith and without ulterior purposes , to join them in the development of a peaceful American commercial policy that may in time include this continent and the West Indian Islands . Let this be comprehended , and there will be no political reason why we may not secure to the United States that proportionate share of the trade of this continent to which their close relations of geographical contiguity and political friendship with all the States of America justly entitle them . It may not be enough to remove the political obstacles only . The financial policy which the war made necessary may have operated injuriously upon our commerce with these States . The resolution of the Senate calls , on these points , for detailed information which is not within the control of the Secretary of State , and for recommendations for the future which he is not prepared to give without that information to fully answer the Senate s call , it would probably be necessary to employ some competent agent , familiar with the Spanish American States , to collate and arrange the information asked for . For this there is no appropriation by Congress . Respectfully submitted . HAMILTON FISH .
