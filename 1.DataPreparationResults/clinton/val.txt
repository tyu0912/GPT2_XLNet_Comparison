Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , and let me thank you all for being here . Thank you , Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein , for your ground breaking work here . Thank you , Senator Exon my longtime friend Senator Heflin . Thank you , Congressman Frost , Congressman Stupak , Congressman Orton . I thank all the representatives here of the victims community , the law enforcement community . I thank the Attorney General and John Schmidt and Aileen Adams and Bonnie Campbell for doing such a fine job at the Justice Department on all criminal justice issues . I thank the Vice President and , especially , I want to thank Roberta Roper and the other members of the National Movement for Victims Advocacy . Roper , thank you for coming . Thank you , John and Pat Byron thank you , Mark Klaas and thank you , Pam McClain . And especially , John Walsh , thank you for spending all of these years to bring these issues to America s attention . Thank you , sir . I had also like to say a special word of thanks to the person who did more than any other person in the United States to talk me through all the legal and practical matters that have to be resolved in order for the President to advocate amending our Constitution former prosecutor and a former colleague of mine , Governor Bob Miller of Nevada . Thank you , sir , for your work here . For years , we have worked to make our criminal justice system more effective , more fair , more even handed , more vigilant in the protection of the innocent . Today , the system bends over backwards to protect those who may be innocent , and that is as it should be . But it too often ignores the millions and millions of people who are completely innocent because they are victims , and that is wrong . That is what we are trying to correct today . When someone is a victim , he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process , not on the outside looking in . Participation in all forms of government is the essence of democracy . Victims should be guaranteed the right to participate in proceedings related to crimes committed against them . People accused of crimes have explicit constitutional rights . Ordinary citizens have a constitutional right to participate in criminal trials by serving on a jury . The press has a constitutional right to attend trials . All of this is as it should be . It is only the victims of crime who have no constitutional right to participate , and that is not the way it should be . Having carefully studied all the alternatives , I am now convinced that the only way to fully safeguard the rights of victims in America is to amend our Constitution and guarantee these basic rights to be told about public court proceedings and to attend them to make a statement to the court about bail , about sentencing , about accepting a plea if the victim is present to be told about parole hearings to attend and to speak notice when the defendant or convict escapes or is released restitution from the defendant reasonable protection from the defendant and notice of these rights . If you have ever been a victim of a violent crime it probably would not even occur to you that these rights could be denied if you have never been a victim . But actually , it happens time and time again . It happens in spite of the fact that the victims rights movement in America has been an active force for about 20 years now . The wife of a murdered State trooper in Maryland is left crying outside the courtroom for the entire trial of her husband s killers , because the defense subpoenaed her as a witness just to keep her out and never even called her . A rape victim in Florida is not notified when her rapist is released on parole . He finds her and kills her . Last year in New Jersey , 8 year old Jakiyah McClain was sexually assaulted and brutally murdered . She had gone to visit a friend and never came home . Police found her in the closet of an abandoned apartment now , her mother wants to use a New Jersey law that gives the murder victims survivors the right to address a jury deciding on the death penalty . She wants the jury to know more about this fine young girl than the crime scene reports . She wants them to know that Jakiyah was accepted into a school for gifted children the day before she died . But a New Jersey judge decided she cannot testify even though the State law gave her the right to do so . He ruled that the defendant s constitutional right to a fair trial required him to strike the law down . Well , Jakiyah s mother had the courage to overcome her pain to be with us today . We have to change this for her and for other victims in America . Thank you , and God bless you . The only way to give victims equal and due consideration is to amend the Constitution . For nearly 20 years I have been involved in the fight for victims rights since I was attorney general in my home State . We passed laws then to guarantee victims rights to attend trials and to get restitutions and later to get notice and to participate in parole hearings . Over all those years , I learned what every victim of crime knows too well As long as the rights of the accused are protected but the rights of victims are not , time and again , the victims will lose . When a judge balances defendants rights in the Federal Constitution against victims rights in a statute or a State constitution , the defendants rights almost always prevail . That is just how the law works today . We want to level the playing field . This is not about depriving people accused of crimes of their legitimate rights , including the presumption of innocence this is about simple fairness . When a judge balances the rights of the accused and the rights of the victim , we want the rights of the victim to get equal weight . When a plea bargain is entered in public , a criminal is sentenced , a defendant is let out on bail , the victim ought to know about it and ought to have a say . I want to work with the congressional leadership , the House and Senate Judiciary Committees , including Senators Kyl and Feinstein and Chairman Hyde and law enforcement officials , to craft the best possible amendment . It should guarantee victims rights in every court in the land , Federal , State , juvenile , and military . It should be self executing so that it takes effect as soon as it is ratified without additional legislation . Congress will take responsibility to enforce victims rights in Federal courts , and the States will keep responsibility to enforce them in State courts , but we need the amendment . I also want to say , just before I go forward , again I want to thank Senators Kyl and Feinstein and the others who have approached this in a totally bipartisan manner . This is a cause for all Americans . When people are victimized , the criminal almost never asks before you are robbed or beaten or raped or murdered Are you a Republican or a Democrat This is a matter of national security just as much as the national security issues beyond our borders on which we try to achieve a bipartisan consensus . And I applaud the nonpolitical and patriotic way in which this manner has been approached in the Congress , just like it is approached every day in the country , and we ought to do our best to keep it that way . We know that there can be , with any good effort , unforeseen consequences . We think we know what they would likely be , and we believe we know how to guard against them . We certainly do not want to make it harder for prosecutors to convict violent criminals . We sure do not want to give criminals like gang members , who may be victims of their associates , any way to take advantage of these rights just to slow the criminal justice process down . We want to protect victims , not accidentally help criminals . But we can solve these problems . The problems are not an excuse for inaction . We still have to go forward . Of course , amending the Constitution can take a long time . It may take years . And while we work to amend it , we must do everything in our power to enhance the protection of victims rights now . Today I am directing the Attorney General to hold the Federal system to a higher standard than ever before , to guarantee maximum participation by victims under existing law and to review existing legislation to see what further changes we ought to make . I will give you an example . There ought to be , I believe , in every law , Federal and State , a protection for victims who participate in the criminal justice process not to be discriminated against on the job because they have to take time off . That protection today is accorded to jury members it certainly ought to extend to people who are victims who need to be in the criminal justice process . And we should not wait for that kind of thing to be done . I want investigators and prosecutors to take the strongest steps to include victims . I want work to begin immediately to launch a computerized system so victims get information about new developments in a case , in changes in the status or the location of a defendant or a convict . I do not support amending the Constitution lightly . It is sacred . It should be changed only with great caution and after much consideration . But I reject the idea that it should never be changed . Change it lightly , and you risk its distinction . But never change it , and you risk its vitality . I have supported the goals of many constitutional amendments since I took office , but in each amendment that has been proposed during my tenure as President , I have opposed the amendment either because it was not appropriate or not necessary . But this is different . I want to balance the budget , for example , but the Constitution already gives us the power to do that . What we need is the will and to work together to do that . I want young people to be able to express their religious convictions in an appropriate manner wherever they are , even in a school , but the Constitution protects people s rights to express their faith . But this is different . This is not an attempt to put legislative responsibilities in the Constitution or to guarantee a right that is already guaranteed . Amending the Constitution here is simply the only way to guarantee that victims rights are weighted equally with defendants rights in every courtroom in America . Two hundred twenty years ago , our Founding Fathers were concerned , justifiably , that Government never , never trample on the rights of people just because they are accused of a crime . Today , it is time for us to make sure that while we continue to protect the rights of the accused , Government does not trample on the rights of the victims . Until these rights are also enshrined in our Constitution , the people who have been hurt most by crime will continue to be denied equal justice under law . That is what this country is really all about , equal justice under law . And crime victims deserve that as much as any group of citizens in the United States ever will . Thank you , God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Thank you , Jim , and thank you to the people of Hartford , our hosts . I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service , and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas , not insults . Four years ago I ran for President at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration . I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all , responsibility from all , and an American community where everybody has a role to play . I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people have the tools to make the most of their own lives . Four years ago you took me on faith . Now there is a record 10 million more jobs , rising incomes , falling crime rates and welfare rolls , a strong America at peace . We are better off than we were four years ago . Let us keep it going . We cut the deficit by 60 percent . Now let us balance the budget and protect Medicare , Medicaid , education , and the environment . We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans . Now let us pass the tax cuts for education and childrearing , help with medical emergencies and buying a home . We passed family and medical leave . Now let us expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force . We passed the 100 , 000 police , the assault weapons ban , the Brady Bill . Now let us keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs . We passed welfare reform . Now let us move a million people from welfare to work . And most important , let us make education our highest priority so that every 8 year old will be able to read , every 12 year old can log on to the Internet , every 18 year old can go to college . We can build that bridge to the 21st century , and I look forward to discussing exactly how we are going to do it . Well , Jim , I believe that the federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives . That , to me , is the key . And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole . For example , we have reduced the size of the federal government to its smallest size in 30 years . We have reduced more regulations , eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors . But I have worked hard for things like the family and medical leave law , the Brady bill , the assault weapons ban , the program to put 100 , 000 police on the street . All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed , that I supported because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives . I have worked hard to help families impart values to their own children . I supported the V chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they are young , along with the ratings system for television and educational television . I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing , advertising , and sale of tobacco to young people . I supported a big increase in the safe and drug free schools program . These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed , but I believed that they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future . I trust the people . We have done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives . But I do think we are right when we try to , for example , give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital , ending these drive by deliveries . I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum Kennedy bill , which states you cannot lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family has been sick . Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican Presidents . But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century . State of the Nation I agree with that . That is right . I do not know , I look at the slowest growth in a century . He inherited a growth of 4 . 7 , 4 . 8 percent now it is down to about 2 . 4 percent . We are going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history . We have got stagnant wages in fact , women s wages have dropped 2 . 2 percent . Men s wages have not gone up , gone down . So we have stagnation . We have the highest foreign debt in history . And it seems to me that if you take a look are you better off Well , I guess some may be better off . Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago . Rene Preval is probably better off than he was four years ago . But are the American people They are working harder and harder and paying more taxes . For the first time in history , you pay about 40 percent of what you earn , more than you spend for food , clothing , and shelter combined , for taxes under this administration . So some may be better off . They talk about family income being up . That is not true in Connecticut family income is down . And it is up in some cases because both parents are working one works for the family , and one works to pay taxes for the Government . We are going to give them a tax cut so they can spend more time with their children , maybe even take a vacation . That is what America is all about . Well , let me say , first of all , in February , Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it is been in in 30 years . We have 10 million more jobs , a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s . Wages are going up for the first time in a decade . We have record number of new small businesses . We had the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years . All groups of people are growing we had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995 . The average family s income has gone up over 1 , 600 just since our economic plan passed . So I think it is clear that we are better off than we were four years ago . Now we need to focus on , what do we need to do to be better off still How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses , to be able to afford health insurance , to be able to educate their children That is what I want to focus on . But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago , as Senator Dole acknowledged this year . Absolutely not . Let us look at the position . First of all , remember that in this campaign season , since Senator Dole has been a candidate , he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning , in 1965 , one of only 12 members . He said he did the right thing then he knew it would not work at the time . That is what he said . Then his budget , that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich , cut Medicare 270 billion , more than was necessary to repair the Medicare Trust Fund . It would have charged seniors more for out of pocket costs , as well as more in premiums , because doctors could have charged them more . The American Hospital Association , the nurses association , the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed . And now , with this risky 550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole s , even his own friends his campaign cochair , Senator D Amato , says that they cannot possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well , according to him . Now , my balanced budget plan adds 10 years to the life of the Medicare Trust Fund 10 years . And we will have time to deal with the long term problems of the baby boomers . But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare 270 billion , to run the risk of it withering on the vine . We always have to reform it over the years , but we need someone who believes in it to reform it . Well , let me say first of all , I had be happy to have a commission deal with this , and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the 83 Social Security commission . But it will not be possible to do if his tax scheme passes , because even his own campaign co chair , Senator D Amato , says he will have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed . I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system . My balanced budget plan puts 10 years onto Medicare . We ought to do that then we can have a commission . But Senator Dole s plans are not good for the country . Senator Dole s Tax Cut Proposal Me too That is good . I need it . And it is also regulatory reform . So it is a good package , President , and we had like to have your support . Well , here s the problem with it . It sounds very good , but there is a reason that 500 economists , including seven Nobel Prize winners , and business periodicals like Business Week and even Senator Dole s friend Senator Warren Rudman , former Republican Senator from New Hampshire , says it is not a practical program . It is a 550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit , which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages , car payments , credit card payments , college loans , and small business loans . It is not good to raise the deficit we have worked too hard to lower it . It will actually raise taxes on 9 million people . And in addition to that , it will force bigger cuts in Medicare , Medicaid , education , and the environment than the ones that he and Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year . So it sounds great . But our targeted tax cut for education , childrearing , health care , and homebuying , which is paid for in my balanced budget plan something that he has not done certified by the Congressional Budget Office , that is the right way to go . Well , I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible , tell people what I stand for , and let them decide whether they are going to support me or not . The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers . In the case of the product liability bill , which they passed and I vetoed I think that is what he is talking about I actually wanted to sign that bill , and I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign . Now , a lot of the trial lawyers did not want me to sign any bill at all , but I thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits . But they would not make some of the changes that I thought should be made . And let me just give you an example . I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a schoolbus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly , but there were problems with the schoolbus . The drunk driver had no money . Under the new bill , if I had signed it , a person like that could never have had any recovery . I thought that was wrong . So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress , and I said , Prove to me that these people could recover , but we are going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits I will sign the bill . But generally , I believe that a President has to be willing to do what he thinks is right . I have done a lot of things that were controversial my economic plan , my trade position , Bosnia , Haiti , taking on the NRA for the first time , taking on the tobacco companies for the first time . Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it is right for the country over the long run . That is what I have tried to do , and that is what I will continue to do as President . Let me say , first of all , I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago . I have proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform . Secondly , Senator Dole has had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money , but it was not me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who are subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up to the federal government when we tried to stop the advertising , marketing , and sales of tobacco to children . And it was not me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress , into the rooms , and rewrite the environmental laws . That is what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did , not me . So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other s motivations . I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree . Lehrer , I hope we will have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program , but let me respond to what you said . I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform . That was certainly the case from the minute I got there . So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress , I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested a gentleman that , unfortunately , just passed away a couple of days ago suggested that we appoint a commission . And I shook hands with him on it , and I appointed my members , and the commission never met . And then Senator Dole s ardent supporter Senator McCain , who is out there today , along with Senator Feingold , supported sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal . I strongly supported it , and members of Senator Dole s own party in the Senate killed it . And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain Feingold bill . So I think the American people , including the Perot supporters , know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform , and I will continue to have . And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress , because we need it badly . I agree . Teenage Drug Use Well , Jim , I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what is happened . I am . But let us look at the overall record . Overall in America , cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years , casual drug use down 13 percent . The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs , up to about 11 percent total with marijuana . And I regret it . Let me tell you what I have tried to do about it . I appointed a four star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation s drug czar , the most heavily decorated soldier in uniform when he retired . We submitted the biggest drug budget ever . We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border . We supported a crime bill that had 60 death penalties , including the death penalty for drug kingpins . And I supported a big expansion in the safe and drug free schools program to support things like the A . program , because I thought all those things were very important . Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still do not understand drugs are wrong , drugs can kill you , even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them I think we all do . And I hope we can do better . I do not think this issue should be politicized , because my record is clear and I do not think Senator Dole supports using drugs . I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it is not dangerous and will not kill them and will not destroy their lives get the message and change . Let me say again , we did have a drug czar in Arkansas , but he answered to the Governor , just like this one answers to the President . That is what I thought we ought to do . Secondly , Senator Dole , you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it , and you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act . I do not think that means you are soft on drugs . We just have a different approach . But let me remind you that my family has suffered from drug abuse . I know what it is like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives , and I hate drugs , Senator . We need to do this together , and we can . Gun Control The President . Let me say , first of all , Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he had be for repealing the Brady bill or repealing the assault weapons ban , and I think his present position is that he would not do so . And if that is true , I am grateful for it . But let us look at the facts here . The Brady bill has kept at least 60 , 000 felons , fugitives , and stalkers from getting handguns . Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady bill . He tried to keep it from coming to my desk . He did not succeed , and I signed it , and I am glad I did . Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate , Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association did not want the assault weapons ban , just like they did not want the Brady bill . But two years later , nobody has lost their handguns , I mean , their rifles . We have expanded the Brady bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids . And this is a safer country . So I am glad I took on that fight . And I believe , with all respect , I was right , and he was wrong . If that is what he said , he is not right about that . Look at where we are today . The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st century . I have worked to support our country as the world s strongest force for peace and freedom , prosperity and security . We have done the following things Number one , we have managed the aftermath of the Cold War , supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia , the removal of Russian troops from the Baltics , the integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO and , I might add , with a democratic Russia . There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age . We have worked hard for peace and freedom . When I took office , Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States . When I took office , the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia . Now there is a democratically elected President in Haiti , peace in Bosnia . We have just had elections there . We have made progress in Northern Ireland and the Middle East . We have also stood up to the new threats of terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , organized crime . And we have worked hard to expand America s economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade , with the largest number of new trade agreements in history . That is one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again . First of all , I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia , but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened . I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances . And let us not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there . Secondly , in Haiti , political violence is much , much smaller than it was . Thirdly , in Bosnia it is a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war . And at least there has now been an election , and the institutions are beginning to function . In Northern Ireland and the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago . There will always be problems in this old world , but if we are moving in the right direction and America is leading , we are better off . Our military is the strongest military in the world . It is the strongest , best prepared , best equipped it has ever been . There is very little difference in the budget that I have proposed and the Republican budget over the next six year period . We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system . I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers , for our men and women in uniform , for their families , for their training . That is my solemn obligation . You asked , when do you decide to deploy them The interests of the American people must be at stake our values must be at stake we have to be able to make a difference . And frankly , we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform . But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful , in Haiti , in Bosnia , when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein s threatened invasion of Kuwait , when I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan Straits , when we have worked hard to end the North Korean nuclear threat . I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined , careful , effective deployment of our military resources . Well , first of all , for the last four years we have worked hard to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and a move toward democracy . In 1992 , before I became President , Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act , and I enforced it vigorously . We made the embargo tougher , but we increased contacts , people to people , with the Cubans , including direct telephone service , which was largely supported by the Cuban American community . Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international airspace . They were completely beyond the pale of the law , and I signed the Helms Burton legislation . Senator Dole is correct . I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed , even though they are effective now and can be legally binding , because I want to change Cuba . And the United States needs help from other countries . Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now . But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy . Every single country in Latin America , Central America , and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba . And if we stay firm and strong , we will be able to bring Cuba around as well . There were several off the subject whoppers in that litany . Let me just mention , Senator Dole voted for 900 billion in tax increases . His runningmate , Jack Kemp , once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he did not hike . And everybody knows , including the Wall Street Journal , hardly a friend of the Democratic Party or this administration , that the 82 tax increase he sponsored , in inflation adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history . So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here . Health Care Reform Well , that sounds very good , but it is very wrong . Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a health care bill in 1994 but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill . And they said no , because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big Government and make sure nothing was done to aid health care before the 94 elections so they could make that claim . Well , maybe we bit off more than we could chew . But we are pursuing a step by step reform now . The Kennedy Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family has been sick . I signed a bill to stop these drive by deliveries where insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours . And I vetoed Senator Dole s Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine . Iraq Well , I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances . Saddam Hussein is under a resolution not to threaten his neighbors or repress his own citizens . Unfortunately , a lot of people have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be , and we have been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now . What happened was , one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north . But we felt , since the whole world community had told him not to do it , that once he did it we had to do something . We did not feel that I could commit I certainly did not feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone , and that was the only way to do that . So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors . We did that by expanding what is called the no fly zone , by increasing our allies control of the airspace , now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad . Was it the right thing to do I believe it was . Is it fully effective Did it make him withdraw from the north Well , he has a little bit , and I hope he will continue . We have learned that if you give him an inch he will take a mile . We had to do something . And even though not all of our allies supported it at first , I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do . Senator Dole has , two or three times before tonight , criticized me for working with the Now I am being criticized for not working with the Sometimes the United States has to act alone , or at least has to act first . Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy . I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq that would have been wrong . I could reduce Saddam Hussein s ability to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again . That is what I did I still believe it was the right thing to do . Middle East Peace Process started again today . But again , it is almost like an ad hoc foreign policy . It is ad hoc . It is sort of , Well , we get up in the morning and read the papers and what country s in trouble , we will have a meeting . To me , that is not the strategy that I think that people expect from America . I think we have lost credibility . And I say this very honestly , without any partisanship . We have lost credibility around the world . Our allies do not they are not certain what we are going to do , what our reaction , what our response is going to be . Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq , if that was the hint there from the President . But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was , and I do believe that we did not gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders one refused to come to Washington , D We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East It is to support the peace process , to support the security of Israel , and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace . It is a very difficult environment . The feelings are very strong . There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process . Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace . I would liked to have had a big , organized summit , but those people were killing each other rapidly . Innocent Arab children , innocent Israeli people they were dying . So much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government . I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say , let us stop the violence , start talking , commit to the negotiations , that would be a plus . Now , today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East , and they have started negotiations . And all of those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again . Well , I am saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past . And I think I know what he meant by that . He is troubled , as I am , by some of the things that go on today . But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge , the barriers of the present , always moving into the future . That is why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this old , stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long , to get this country moving again . And that is why we have got a country with 10 million more jobs and record numbers of new businesses and rising incomes and falling crime rates and welfare roll rates . That is why we are moving in the right direction . And I am trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that . That is why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy . That is why I want a tax cut for education and childrearing , but it is got to be paid for . That is why I want to continue the work we have done , over partisan opposition , to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again . These are my commitments . I am very oriented toward the future . I think this election has to be geared toward the future . I think America s best days are still ahead . But we have got to build the right bridge . I do not for a moment think I am entitled to all the credit for the good things that have happened in America . But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives , I think I should get some credit for that . I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem . But you know , I think my ideas are better for the future . Senator Dole voted against student loans , against Head Start , against creating the Department of Education . If he gets elected President , we will start the new century without anyone in the Cabinet of the President representing education and our children . I personally do not think that is the right kind of future for America , and I think we ought to take a different tack . Education Let me say , first of all , I am all for students having more choices . We have worked hard to expand public school choice . In my balanced budget bill there are funds for 3 , 000 new schools , created by teachers and parents , sometimes by business people , called charter schools that have no rules . They are free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children . The ones that are out there are doing well . What I am against is Senator Dole s plan to take money away from all of the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer . If we are going to have a private voucher plan , that ought to be done at the local level or the State level . But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education . He voted against student loans , he voted against my improved student loan plan , he voted against the national service bill , against the Head Start bill . He voted against our efforts in safe and drug free schools . He has voted against these programs . He does not believe it . That is the issue . Ninety percent of our kids are out there in those public schools , and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I have outlined in this campaign . I support school choice . I support school choice . I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and , I said , the creation of 3 , 000 new schools that we are going to help the States to finance . But if you are going to have a private voucher plan , that ought to be determined by States and localities where they are raising and spending most of the money . I simply think it is wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids 90 percent of them are in the public schools to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program , that are helping to fund the other programs that are helping our schools to improve their standards . Our schools are getting better . And our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level . I have been a strong force for reform . And Senator , I remind you that a few years ago , when I supported a teacher testing law in my home State , I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association . I just do not believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican Convention . I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward . And let me just say , that budget you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50 , 000 kids out of Head Start . It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan . And it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships . Now , it would have that is a fact . That is one of the big reasons I vetoed it . We need to be doing more in education , not less . First of all , Senator Dole , let us set the record straight . I was able , for two years when I was a very young boy , to go to a Catholic school , but I basically went to public schools all my life . And I have worked hard for a long time to make them better . Ninety percent of our kids are there . It is amazing to me you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools , where we do not have very much money at the federal level to spend on education . We ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help . If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private school choice plan like Milwaukee did , let them have at it . I might say , the results are highly ambiguous . But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children . And that is why I vetoed the budget that you passed with 30 billion in education cuts . It was wrong , and my plan for the future is better . Political Philosophy When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists , young elitists in the administration , one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said , President , I know how you grew up . Who is he talking about And you know , this liberal charge , that is what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race . It is sort of their golden oldie , you know , it is a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear . And I just do not think that dog will hunt this time . The American people should make up their own mind . Here s the record We cut the deficit four years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War I mean , before World War II and maybe before the Civil War , too . We have got 10 million new jobs . We have got record numbers of new small businesses . We made every one of them eligible for a tax cut . We have got declining crime rates , two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed , and a 50 percent increase in child support , and a crime bill with 60 death penalties , 100 , 000 police , and the assault weapons ban . The American people can make up their mind about whether that is a liberal record or a record that is good for America . Liberal , conservative , you put whatever label you want on it . I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives , to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility , and to build a sense of community so we are all working together . I do not believe in discrimination . I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy . I believe that we have to do these things with a government that is smaller and less bureaucratic but that we have to do them nonetheless . It is inconvenient for Senator Dole , but the truth is I have reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors . And I did stop them , I admit that I sure stopped their budget . Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third . It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump by a third . It ended the principle of the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent . Their budget weakened our support for education 30 billion , even cut funds for scholarships and college loans . Their budget cut 270 billion in Medicare . And finally , their budget withdrew the national guarantee of health care to poor children , families with children with handicaps , the elderly in nursing homes , poor pregnant women . It was wrong for the country , and calling it conservative will not make it right . It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I had not stopped it . The way to get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare , Medicaid , education , and the environment to give a targeted tax cut and let me talk about the education tax cut to let people have a 10 , 000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year , any kind of college tuition to give families a tax credit , a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody , and then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education , homebuying , or medical expenses . That is the right way to go into the 21st century , balance the budget and cut taxes , not balloon with this 550 billion tax scheme . Personal Differences I think he is a bit taller than I am . But I think there are personal differences . I mean , I do not like to get into personal matters . As far as I am concerned , this is a campaign about issues . It is about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America , and not about personal things . And I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past . I know he wants to disown it . I would not want to be a liberal either , President , but you are stuck with it because that is your record . It is your record in Arkansas , the biggest tax increase in history , the biggest crime increase in history , biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas . Well , just for the record , when I was a Governor , we had the lowest second lowest tax burden of any State in the country , the highest job growth rate of any State when I ran for President , and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances . But the important thing is , what are we going to do now I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future , targeted to education and childrearing , with the rest of the education plan hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000 , making sure we have got an army of reading volunteers , trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our 8 year olds can learn to read investing in our environment , cleaning up two thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps . Those plans are better than this 550 billion tax scheme . Now , remember , folks , even Senator Dole s campaign cochair , Senator D Amato , says he is got to cut Medicare to pay for this . Everybody who has looked at it , 500 economists , seven Nobel Prize winners , say it is bad for the economy . It is going to blow a hole in the deficit , raise taxes on nine million people , and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed . Our plan is better . It will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families . You did not even have tax cuts in your budget , President , the first two years you were President . It was not until we had a Republican Congress that you even thought about you talked about tax cuts . And getting back to personal differences , I think , Jim , if you are a little more specific , but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight , and that is the question of pardons . I know you talked about it with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show . And I have never discussed Whitewater , as I have told you personally I am not discussing Whitewater now . But I am discussing a power the President has to grant pardons , and hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest . Well , first of all , he made that remark about Senator D Amato . He is arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D Amato in the last couple of years , and so I am more familiar with his comments than I used to be . Let me say what I have said already about this pardon issue . This is an issue they brought up . There has been no consideration of it , no discussion of it . I will tell you this I will not give anyone special treatment , and I will strictly adhere to the law . And that is what every President has done , as far as I know in the past . But whatever other Presidents have done , this is something I take seriously , and that is my position . But he is not my general chairman , he is a friend of mine . And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours . . . You bet . One of your liberal friends . That is right . Thank you . No comment . I had like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side and to move this country forward , and we are better off than we were four years ago . But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st century is a better plan a targeted tax cut a real commitment to educational reform a deep commitment to making welfare reform work , with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work now we have to create those jobs , now that we are requiring people to go to work a commitment to step by step health care reform , with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access health care and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while a commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment . That is what I had like them to know about me , that I have gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true . And I believe we have got the results to show we are on the right track . The most important thing is I believe we have got the right ideas for the future . And like Senator Dole I like Senator Dole . You can probably tell we like each other . We just see the world in different ways , and you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right . Let us look at that . When I ran for President , I said we had cut the deficit in half in four years we have cut it by 60 percent . I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs we have 10 million new jobs . We are number one in autos again , record numbers of new small businesses . I said we had pass a crime bill that would put 100 , 000 police on the street , ban assault weapons , and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment , including capital punishment for drug kingpins . And we did that . I said we would change the way welfare works . And even before the bill passed , we had moved nearly two million people from welfare to work , working with States and communities . I said we had get tougher on child support , and child support enforcement is up 50 percent . I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans . The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be , and I think they are better off , all of us are , that we got those interest rates down and the deficit down . The Republicans talk about it , but we are the first administration in anybody s lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row . We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans . And now I have got a plan that has been out there for two years it could have been passed already , but instead the Republicans shut the Government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me , and I could not take that . But we will get the rest of that tax relief . And so I think when you can look at those results , you know that the plan I have laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you will give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st century . I think a lot of people deserve credit , and I have tried to give it to them . But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole s ill advised , 550 billion scheme , which I will say again will blow a hole in the deficit . Our plan will balance the budget and grow the economy , preserve the environment , and invest in education . We have the right approach for the future . And look at the results It is not midnight in America , Senator . We are better off than we were four years ago . Well , first , Jim , let me thank you , and thank you , Senator Dole , and thank you , ladies and gentlemen , all of you listening tonight , for the chance you have given us to appear . I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as President for the last four years . I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life , and I have done my best to be faithful to the charge you have given me . I am proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago . I am glad we are going in the right direction . And I have done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century . I had like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as President are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or does not happen in this country the autoworker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job , because we are number one in auto production again all the people I have met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children and I think what others could do for our country and for themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way . I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer , and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job , because of the Family and Medical Leave Act . I think of all the people that I grew up with and went to school with whom I stay in touch with and who never let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America . Folks , we can build that bridge to the 21st century , big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across . And I hope that you will help me build it . http www . dolekemp96 . org . Thank you . God bless America .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens , tonight is my last opportunity to speak to you from the Oval Office as your President . I am profoundly grateful to you for twice giving me the honor to serve , to work for you and with you to prepare our Nation for the 21st century . And I am grateful to Vice President Gore , to my Cabinet Secretaries , and to all those who have served with me for the last eight years . This has been a time of dramatic transformation , and you have risen to every new challenge . You have made our social fabric stronger , our families healthier and safer , our people more prosperous . You , the American people , have made our passage into the global information age an era of great American renewal . In all the work I have done as President every decision I have made , every executive action I have taken , every bill I have proposed and signed I have tried to give all Americans the tools and conditions to build the future of our dreams in a good society with a strong economy , a cleaner environment , and a freer , safer , more prosperous world . I have steered my course by our enduring values opportunity for all , responsibility from all , a community of all Americans . I have sought to give America a new kind of Government , smaller , more modern , more effective , full of ideas and policies appropriate to this new time , always putting people first , always focusing on the future . Working together , America has done well . Our economy is breaking records with more than 22 million new jobs , the lowest unemployment in 30 years , the highest homeownership ever , the longest expansion in history . Our families and communities are stronger . Thirty five million Americans have used the family leave law 8 million have moved off welfare . Crime is at a 25 year low . Over 10 million Americans receive more college aid , and more people than ever are going to college . Our schools are better . Higher standards , greater accountability , and larger investments have brought higher test scores and higher graduation rates . More than 3 million children have health insurance now , and more than 7 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty . Incomes are rising across the board . Our air and water are cleaner . Our food and drinking water are safer . And more of our precious land has been preserved in the continental United States than at any time in a 100 years . America has been a force for peace and prosperity in every corner of the globe . I am very grateful to be able to turn over the reins of leadership to a new President with America in such a strong position to meet the challenges of the future . Tonight I want to leave you with three thoughts about our future . First , America must maintain our record of fiscal responsibility . Through our last four budgets we have turned record deficits to record surpluses , and we have been able to pay down 600 billion of our national debt on track to be debt free by the end of the decade for the first time since 1835 . Staying on that course will bring lower interest rates , greater prosperity , and the opportunity to meet our big challenges . If we choose wisely , we can pay down the debt , deal with the retirement of the baby boomers , invest more in our future , and provide tax relief . Second , because the world is more connected every day , in every way , America s security and prosperity require us to continue to lead in the world . At this remarkable moment in history , more people live in freedom than ever before . Our alliances are stronger than ever . People all around the world look to America to be a force for peace and prosperity , freedom and security . The global economy is giving more of our own people and billions around the world the chance to work and live and raise their families with dignity . But the forces of integration that have created these good opportunities also make us more subject to global forces of destruction , to terrorism , organized crime and narcotrafficking , the spread of deadly weapons and disease , the degradation of the global environment . The expansion of trade has not fully closed the gap between those of us who live on the cutting edge of the global economy and the billions around the world who live on the knife s edge of survival . This global gap requires more than compassion it requires action . Global poverty is a powder keg that could be ignited by our indifference . In his first Inaugural Address , Thomas Jefferson warned of entangling alliances . But in our times , America cannot and must not disentangle itself from the world . If we want the world to embody our shared values , then we must assume a shared responsibility . If the wars of the 20th century , especially the recent ones in Kosovo and Bosnia , have taught us anything , it is that we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom and peace . We must embrace boldly and resolutely that duty to lead to stand with our allies in word and deed and to put a human face on the global economy , so that expanded trade benefits all peoples in all nations , lifting lives and hopes all across the world . Third , we must remember that America cannot lead in the world unless here at home we weave the threads of our coat of many colors into the fabric of one America . As we become ever more diverse , we must work harder to unite around our common values and our common humanity . We must work harder to overcome our differences , in our hearts and in our laws . We must treat all our people with fairness and dignity , regardless of their race , religion , gender , or sexual orientation , and regardless of when they arrived in our country always moving toward the more perfect Union of our Founders dreams . Hillary , Chelsea , and I join all Americans in wishing our very best to the next President , George Bush , to his family and his administration , in meeting these challenges , and in leading freedom s march in this new century . As for me , I will leave the Presidency more idealistic , more full of hope than the day I arrived , and more confident than ever that America s best days lie ahead . My days in this office are nearly through , but my days of service , I hope , are not . In the years ahead , I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of President of the United States . But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizens . Thank you . God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of the 104th Congress , distinguished guests , my fellow Americans all across our land Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world , and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their families , I thank you . America is very , very proud of you . My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union , not the state of our government but of our American community , and to set forth our responsibilities , in the words of our Founders , to form a more perfect Union . The state of the Union is strong . Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades . We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years . We have completed created nearly eight million new jobs , over a million of them in basic industries like construction and automobiles . America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970s . And for three years in a row , we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country . Our leadership in the world is also strong , bringing hope for new peace . And perhaps most important , we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values . The crime rate , the welfare and food stamp rolls , the poverty rate , and the teen pregnancy rate are all down . And as they go down , prospects for America s future go up . We live in an age of possibility . A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory . Now we move to an age of technology , information , and global competition . These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people , but they have also presented them with stiff challenges . While more Americans are living better , too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up , and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families . We must answer here three fundamental questions First , how do we make the American dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it Second , how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future And third , how do we meet these challenges together , as one America We know big government does not have all the answers . We know there is not a program for every problem . We know , and we have worked to give the American people a smaller , less bureaucratic government in Washington . And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means . The era of big government is over . But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves . Instead , we must go forward as one America , one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together . Self reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues we must have both . I believe our new , smaller government must work in an old fashioned American way , together with all of our citizens through state and local governments , in the workplace , in religious , charitable , and civic associations . Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives , with stronger families , more educational opportunity , economic security , safer streets , a cleaner environment in a safer world . To improve the state of our Union , we must ask more of ourselves , we must expect more of each other , and we must face our challenges together . Here , in this place , our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans . There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end . I compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget . And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993 , which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years . Since 1993 , we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction . Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs . Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages , car payments , and credit card rates to ordinary citizens . Now , it is time to finish the job and balance the budget . Though differences remain among us which are significant , the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough , using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in seven years and to provide a modest tax cut . These cuts are real . They will require sacrifice from everyone . But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents , our children , and our future , by endangering Medicare or Medicaid or education or the environment or by raising taxes on working families . I have said before , and let me say again , many good ideas have come out of our negotiations . I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us . I have learned a lot about the good ideas that each side has that we could all embrace . We ought to resolve our remaining differences . I am willing to work to resolve them . I am ready to meet tomorrow . But I ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced budget , a tax cut , lower interest rates , and a brighter future . We should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday s legacy . Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow , beyond the burdens of yesterday . The challenges are significant . But our nation was built on challenges . America was built on challenges , not promises . And when we work together to meet them , we never fail . That is the key to a more perfect Union . Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts . Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people . Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America s families . Family is the foundation of American life . If we have stronger families , we will have a stronger America . Before I go on , I had like to take just a moment to thank my own family , and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and children , a wonderful wife , a magnificent mother , and a great First Lady . Thank you , Hillary . All strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children . I have heard Gore say that it is hard to be a parent today , but it is even harder to be a child . So all of us , not just as parents but all of us in our other roles our media , our schools , our teachers , our communities , our churches and synagogues , our businesses , our governments all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their God given capacities . To the media , I say you should create movies and CDs and television shows you had want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy . I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children . When parents control what their young children see , that is not censorship that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children s upbringing . And I urge them to do it . The V chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this Congress . It has bipartisan support , and I urge you to pass it now . To make the V chip work , I challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have done , to identify your program in ways that help parents to protect their children . And I invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television . I am ready to work with you . I say to those who make and market cigarettes , every year a million children take up smoking , even though it is against the law . Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result . Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children . We are simply saying Market your products to adults , if you wish , but draw the line on children . I say to those who are on welfare , and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time For too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work , instead of supporting them . The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform . We agree on time limits , tough work requirements , and the toughest possible child support enforcement . But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children . I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children . I will sign it immediately . Let us be candid about this difficult problem . Passing a law , even the best possible law , is only a first step . The next step is to make it work . I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence . I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force . I applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor . More than anyone else in our society , they know the true difficulty of the task before us , and they are in a position to help . Every one of us should join them . That is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American people . To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down . I am gratified , as I am sure all Americans are , that it has dropped for two years in a row . But we all know it is still far too high . Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grassroots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy . And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts . I call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one another . We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country . And I challenge America s families to work harder to stay together . For families who stay together not only do better economically , their children do better as well . In particular , I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children . If your family has separated , you must pay your child support . We are doing more than ever to make sure you do , and we are going to do more . But let us all admit something about that , too A check will not substitute for a parent s love and guidance . And only you only you can make the decision to help raise your children . No matter who you are , how low or high your station in life , it is the most basic human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability . Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational opportunities we will all need for this new century . In our schools , every classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway , with computers and good software and well trained teachers . We are working with the telecommunications industry , educators , and parents to connect 20 percent of California s classrooms by this spring , and every classroom and every library in the entire United States by the year 2000 . I ask Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds . Every diploma ought to mean something . I challenge every community , every school , and every state to adopt national standards of excellence , to measure whether schools are meeting those standards , to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grassroots reform , and to hold them accountable for results . That is what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about . I challenge every state to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend , and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job . I challenge all our schools to teach character education , to teach good values and good citizenship . And if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets , then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms . I challenge our parents to become their children s first teachers . Turn off the TSee that the homework is done . And visit your children s classroom . No program , no teacher , no one else can do that for you . My fellow Americans , higher education is more important today than ever before . We have created a new student loan program that is made it easier to borrow and repay those loans , and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate . That is something we should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago . Through AmeriCorps , our national service program , this year 25 , 000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors . These initiatives are right for America , and we should keep them going . And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider . I challenge Congress to expand work study and help one million young Americans work their way through college by the year 2000 , to provide a 1 , 000 merit scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school in the United States , to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and needy students , and to make up to 10 , 000 a year of college tuition tax deductible . It is a good idea for America . Our third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for it , achieve economic security in this new age . People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy . They need education and training for a lifetime . They need more support for families raising children . They need retirement security . They need access to health care . More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply does not last a lifetime . So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping , antiquated job training programs into a simple voucher worth 2 , 600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training . This is a GI bill for America s workers we should all be able to agree on . More and more Americans are working hard without a raise . Congress sets the minimum wage . Within a year , the minimum wage will fall to a 40 year low in purchasing power . Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage , but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on it . I challenge you to raise their minimum wage . In 1993 , Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full time would have to raise their children in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work . This expanded earned income tax credit is now worth about 1 , 800 a year to a family of four living on 20 , 000 . The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly eight million of these people . We should not do that . We should not do that . I also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work . I agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children . That is one of the things most of us in this Chamber , I hope , can agree on . I know it is strongly supported by the Republican majority . And it should be part of any final budget agreement . I want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees . And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans . That is something we should all agree on . We should also protect existing pension plans . Two years ago , with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle , we moved to protect the pensions of eight million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more . Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers pension funds . I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the Treasury . But I believe it is false economy . I vetoed that proposal last year , and I would have to do so again . Finally , if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy , they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick . Over the past two years , over one million Americans in working families have lost their health insurance . We have to do more to make health care available to every American . And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions . Let us all do that . And even as we enact savings in these programs , we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid , not just to the poor but to people in working families , including children , people with disabilities , people with AIDsenior citizens in nursing homes . In the past three years , we have saved 15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse . We have all agreed to save much more . We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund . But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid . America cannot become stronger if they become weaker . The GI bill for workers , tax relief for education and child rearing , pension availability and protection , access to health care , preservation of Medicare and Medicaid , these things , along with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993 , these things will help responsible , hard working American families to make the most of their own lives . But employers and employees must do their part , as well , as they are doing in so many of our finest companies , working together , putting the long term prosperity ahead of the short term gain . As workers increase their hours and their productivity , employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years , as well as the burdens of the bad ones . When companies and workers work as a team they do better , and so does America . Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs . At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime , forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime . This strategy , called community policing , is clearly working . Violent crime is coming down all across America . In New York City murders are down 25 percent , in Louis , 18 percent , in Seattle , 32 percent . But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear . The crime bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing . It provides funds for 100 , 000 new police in communities of all sizes . We are already a third of the way there . And I challenge the Congress to finish the job . Let us stick with a strategy that is working and keep the crime rate coming down . Community policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police . I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers . And to our police , I say , our children need you as role models and heroes . Do not let them down . The Brady bill has already stopped 44 , 000 people with criminal records from buying guns . The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs . I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books . Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob . I am directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles and violent crime , and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults . And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants . From now on , the rule for residents who commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you are out . I challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence . More police and punishment are important , but they are not enough . We have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble , with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington but developed in communities . I challenge all of our communities , all of our adults , to give our children futures to say yes to . And I challenge Congress not to abandon the crime bill s support of these grassroots prevention efforts . Finally , to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem . The challenge begins in our homes , with parents talking to their children openly and firmly . It embraces our churches and synagogues , our youth groups and our schools . I challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug free schools . People like the A . officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes . Meanwhile , we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America . For the last two years , one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort . Tonight I am nominating him , a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern Command , General Barry McCaffrey , as America s new drug czar . General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting for this country . Tonight I ask that he lead our nation s battle against drugs at home and abroad . To succeed , he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before . He needs all of us . Every one of us has a role to play on this team . Thank you , General McCaffrey , for agreeing to serve your country one more time . Our fifth challenge to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation . Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air , lead levels in children s blood has been cut by 70 percent , toxic emissions from factories cut in half . Lake Erie was dead , and now it is a thriving resource . But 10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic waste dump . A third of us breathe air that endangers our health . And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink . We still have much to do . Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent . That means more toxic chemicals in our water , more smog in our air , more pesticides in our food . Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children . Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook . I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them . This issue has not been a partisan issue . The most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon . We can work together . We have to believe some basic things . Do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment I do . Do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up I know we can . That should be our commitment . We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment , and we have to make it easier for them to do it . To businesses this administration is saying If you can find a cheaper , more efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards , do it , as long as you do it right . To communities we say We must strengthen community right to know laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions , but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution . People do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe . Our sixth challenge is to maintain America s leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world . Because of American leadership , more people than ever before live free and at peace . And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security . We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in World War Iand to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since I salute your service and so do the American people . All over the world , even after the Cold War , people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom . But as the Cold War fades into memory , voices of isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities . I say they are wrong . The threats we face today as Americans respect no nation s borders . Think of them terrorism , the spread of weapons of mass destruction , organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious hatred , aggression by rogue states , environmental degradation . If we fail to address these threats today , we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows . Of course , we cannot be everywhere . Of course , we cannot do everything . But where our interests and our values are at stake , and where we can make a difference , America must lead . We must not be isolationist . We must not be the world s policeman . But we can and should be the world s very best peacemaker . By keeping our military strong , by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must , by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts , America is making a difference for people here and around the world . For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America s children . North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program . In Haiti , the dictators are gone , democracy has a new day , the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided . Through tougher trade deals for America , over 80 of them , we have opened markets abroad , and now exports are at an all time high , growing faster than imports and creating good American jobs . We stood with those taking risks for peace in Northern Ireland , where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents , violence must never return in the Middle East , where Arabs and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources and even dreams . And we stood up for peace in Bosnia . Remember the skeletal prisoners , the mass graves , the campaign to rape and torture , the endless lines of refugees , the threat of a spreading war . All these threats , all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace . Now our troops and a strong NATtogether with our new partners from central Europe and elsewhere , are helping that peace to take hold . As all of you know , I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group , and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing . They knew what America s mission in this world is , and they were proud to be carrying it out . Through these efforts , we have enhanced the security of the American people , but make no mistake about it Important challenges remain . The START II treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent . I urge the Senate to ratify it now . We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year . As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway , we can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention this year . We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the antiterrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing , now . We can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to remain the world s leader for peace . My fellow Americans , the six challenges I have just discussed are for all of us . Our seventh challenge is really America s challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight to reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them . Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else . This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists . This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill . This Congress did that , and I applaud you for it . Now I challenge Congress to go further , to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign finance reform bill in a generation . You , Republicans and Democrats alike , can show the American people that we can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates . I also appeal to Congress to pass the line item veto you promised the American people . Our administration is working hard to give the American people a government that works better and costs less . Thanks to the work of Vice President Gore , we are eliminating 16 , 000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations , shifting more decisionmaking out of Washington , back to states and local communities . As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government , we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives . We are helping America s communities , not with more bureaucracy but with more opportunities . Through our successful empowerment zones and community development banks , we are helping people to find jobs , to start businesses . And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property , we can bring jobs back to places that desperately , desperately need them . But there are some areas that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly . One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration . After years of neglect , this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders . We are increasing border controls by 50 percent . We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants . And tonight , I announce I will sign an Executive Order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants . Let me be very clear about this We are still a nation of immigrants we should be proud of it . We should honor every legal immigrant here , working hard to be a good citizen , working hard to become a new citizen . But we are also a nation of laws . I want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal government . Today the federal work force is 200 , 000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President . Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years , and it is getting smaller every day . Most of our fellow Americans probably do not know that . And there is a good reason a good reason The remaining federal work force is composed of hard working Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline . I had like to give you one example . His name is Richard Dean . He is a 49 year old Vietnam veteran who is worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now . Last year he was hard at work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him . He reentered that building four times . He saved the lives of three women . He is here with us this evening , and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism . But Richard Dean s story does not end there . This last November , he was forced out of his office when the government shut down . And the second time the government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients , but he was working without pay . On behalf of Richard Dean and his family , and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people , I challenge all of you in this chamber Let us never , ever shut the federal government down again . On behalf of all Americans , especially those who need their Social Security payments at the beginning of March , I also challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States , to honor the obligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years , to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America keeps its word . I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress and even more from America . But I am confident When Americans work together in their homes , their schools , their churches , their synagogues , their civic groups , their workplace , they can meet any challenge . I say again , the era of big government is over . But we cannot go back to the era of fending for yourself . We have to go forward to the era of working together as a community , as a team , as one America , with all of us reaching across these lines that divide us the division , the discrimination , the rancor we have to reach across it to find common ground . We have got to work together if we want America to work . I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that . Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson , Mississippi , public school system . A Vietnam veteran , he has created groups to help inner city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in . Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City . Like Richard Dean , she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy . She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community . Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans . And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer , not because they are star athletes but because they are star citizens , community heroes meeting America s challenges . They are our real champions . Please stand up . Now each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives . None of us can finish the race alone . We can only achieve our destiny together , one hand , one generation , one American connecting to another . There have always been things we could do together , dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own . We Americans have forged our identity , our very Union , from the very point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet , every different opinion . But we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us , by our belief in progress , our love of liberty , and our relentless search for common ground . America has always sought and always risen to every challenge . Who would say that having come so far together , we will not go forward from here Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans Our country is and always has been a great and good nation . But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts . Thank you . God bless you , and God bless the United States of America . Thank you .<speech_sep>President , Speaker , members of the 104th Congress , my fellow Americans Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy , and once again our democracy has spoken . So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you , Speaker . If we agree on nothing else tonight , we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994 . And as I look out at you , I know how some of you must have felt in 1992 . I must say that in both years we did not hear America singing , we heard America shouting . And now all of us , Republicans and Democrats alike , must say , We hear you . We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us . For we are the keepers of a sacred trust , and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era . Over 200 years ago , our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal , . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , and among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea , the American idea , and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country s great struggle against fascism and to all our Presidents since to fight the Cold War . Especially , I recall two who struggled to fight that Cold War in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party to Harry Truman , who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the Cold War and to Ronald Reagan , whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against Communism was won . In another time of change and challenge , I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post Cold War era , an era marked by the global economy , the information revolution , unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people . I came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission , to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world . I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored . In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes , and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor . But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was two years ago . Thank you . Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy . We are at peace , and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world . We have almost six million new jobs since I became President , and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years . Our businesses are more productive . And here we have worked to bring the deficit down , to expand trade , to put more police on our streets , to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities . But the rising tide is not lifting all boats . While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity , too many of our people are still working harder and harder , for less and less . While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive , too many of our people still cannot be sure of having a job next year or even next month . And far more than our material riches are threatened , things far more precious to us , our children , our families , our values . Our civil life is suffering in America today . Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more . The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed . What are we to do about it More than 60 years ago , at the dawn of another new era , President Roosevelt told our nation , New conditions impose new requirements on government and those who conduct government . And from that simple proposition , he shaped the New Deal , which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their government for half a century . That approach worked in its time . But we today , we face a very different time and very different conditions . We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility . Our government , once a champion of national purpose , is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests , putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead . The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart . So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time . As we enter a new era , we need a new set of understandings , not just with government but , even more important , with one another as Americans . That is what I want to talk with you about tonight . I call it the New Covenant . But it is grounded in a very , very old idea , that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return . Opportunity and responsibility They go hand in hand . We cannot have one without the other . And our national community cannot hold together without both . Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy , how we can change the way our government works to fit a different time , and , above all , how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose . We must have dramatic change in our economy , our government , and ourselves . My fellow Americans , without regard to party , let us rise to the occasion . Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride . As we embark on this new course , let us put our country first , remembering that regardless of party label , we are all Americans . And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one Is it good for the American people Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants . You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector , and I was proud to sign it yesterday . But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here . Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago . The American people look at their capital , and they see a city where the well connected and the well protected can work the system , but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out . As the new Congress opened its doors , lobbyists were still doing business as usual the gifts , the trips , all the things that people are concerned about have not stopped . Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices . I know there were other considerations in those votes , but I want to use something that I have heard my Republican friends say from time to time , There does not have to be a law for everything . So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists perks . Just stop . We do not have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing . But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill , and I will sign that , too . We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they are spending , what they want . We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PACs . And as I have said for three years , we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy , not a weapon of destruction , by giving free TV time to candidates for public office . When the last Congress killed political reform last year , it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred building and cheered . This year , let us give the folks at home something to cheer about . More important , I think we all agree that we have to change the way the government works . Let us make it smaller , less costly , and smarter leaner , not meaner . I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well . The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter . The old way of governing around here protected organized interests . We should look out for the interests of ordinary people . The old way divided us by interest , constituency , or class . The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what is best for our country . The old way dispensed services through large , top down , inflexible bureaucracies . The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens , injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy . The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure . The New Covenant way should have built in incentives to reward success . The old way was centralized here in Washington . The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America . And we should help them to do that . Our job here is to expand opportunity , not bureaucracy , to empower people to make the most of their own lives , and to enhance our security here at home and abroad . We must not ask government to do what we should do for ourselves . We should rely on government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other . I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters , we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem , on the one hand , and the other illusion that the government is a source of every problem we have . Our job is to get rid of yesterday s government so that our own people can meet today s and tomorrow s needs . And we ought to do it together . You know , for years before I became President , I heard others say they would cut government and how bad it was , but not much happened . We actually did it . We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending , more than 300 domestic programs , more than 100 , 000 positions from the federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone . Based on decisions already made , we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the federal government , making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President , by the time I come here again next year . Under the leadership of Vice President Gore , our initiatives have already saved taxpayers 63 billion . The age of the 500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on David Letterman is gone . Deadwood programs , like mohair subsidies , are gone . We have streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1 , 200 offices . We have slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page . We have thrown away the government s 10 , 000 page personnel manual . And the government is working better in important ways FEMthe Federal Emergency Management Agency , has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters . You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires , and they will tell you that . Government workers , working hand in hand with private business , rebuilt Southern California s fractured freeways in record time and under budget . And because the federal government moved fast , all but one of the 5 , 600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business . Now , there are a lot of other things that I could talk about . I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks . University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program , which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students , costs the government less , and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the government and for the universities . We should not cap that program . We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it . Previous government programs gathered dust . The Reinventing Government report is getting results . And we are not through . There is going to be a second round of Reinventing Government . We propose to cut 130 billion in spending by shrinking departments , extending our freeze on domestic spending , cutting 60 public housing programs down to three , getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need , like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program . And we are working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible . The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go . We have to cut yesterday s government to help solve tomorrow s problems . And we need to get government closer to the people it is meant to serve . We need to help move programs down to the point where states and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job . If they can do it , we ought to let them do it . We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better . Taking power away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for . It is time for Congress to stop passing on to the states the cost of decisions we make here in Washington . I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation , but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it . For years , Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects . Last year was no difference . There was a 1 million to study stress in plants and 12 million for a tick removal program that did not work . It is hard to remove ticks . Those of us who have had them know . But I will tell you something , if you will give me line item veto , I will remove some of that unnecessary spending . But I think we should all remember , and almost all of us would agree , that government still has important responsibilities . Our young people we should think of this when we cut our young people hold our future in their hands . We still owe a debt to our veterans . And our senior citizens have made us what we are . Now , my budget cuts a lot . But it protects education , veterans , Social Security , and Medicare , and I hope you will do the same thing . You should , and I hope you will . And when we give more flexibility to the states , let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every state , North and South , East and West Immunization against childhood disease , school lunches in all our schools , Head Start , medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants , all these things , all these things are in the national interest . I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations . But when we deregulate , let us remember what national action in the national interest has given us safer food for our families , safer toys for our children , safer nursing homes for our parents , safer cars and highways , and safer workplaces , cleaner air , and cleaner water . Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations You bet we do . But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water . We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps , and we ought to do it . Should we cut the deficit more Well , of course we should . Of course we should . But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped . I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced budget amendment . I certainly want to balance the budget . Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very , very long time . If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do , then you have to be straight with the American people . They have a right to know what you are going to cut , what taxes you are going to raise , and how it is going to affect them . We should be doing things in the open around here . For example , everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security . I would oppose that , and I think most Americans would . Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system . This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant . It rewards welfare over work . It undermines family values . It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support . It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time . I have worked on this problem for a long time , nearly 15 years now . As a Governor , I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988 . In the last two years , we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform . Our administration gave two dozen states the right to slash through federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency . Last year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration . We have to make welfare what it was meant to be , a second chance , not a way of life . We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible , to provide child care and teach them skills , if that is what they need , for up to two years . And after that , there ought to be a simple , hard rule Anyone who can work must go to work . If a parent is not paying child support , they should be forced to pay . We should suspend drivers license , track them across state lines , make them work off what they owe . That is what we should do . governments do not raise children , people do . And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world . I want to work with you , with all of you , to pass welfare reform . But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence , from welfare to work , from mere childbearing to responsible parenting . Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor . We should , we should require work and mutual responsibility . But we should not cut people off just because they are poor , they are young , or even because they are unmarried . We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings , by requiring them to finish school . But we should not put them and their children out on the street . And I know all the arguments , pro and con , and I have read and thought about this for a long time . I still do not think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents . My fellow Americans , every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region . So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it . But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America . No one is more eager to end welfare I may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office , who is actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare . And I am telling you , the people who are trapped on it know it does not work they also want to get off . So we can promote , together , education and work and good parenting . I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent . I just do not want to punish poverty and past mistakes . All of us have made our mistakes , and none of us can change our yesterdays . But every one of us can change our tomorrows . And America s best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey , who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California . I know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime , as are all the citizens of our country . And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill longer sentences , three strikes and you are out , almost 60 new capital punishment offenses , more prisons , more prevention , 100 , 000 more police . And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate . There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime , to be smarter with crime , to help to lower that rate first . Well , if there are , let us talk about them , and let us do them . But let us not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work , that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing , because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work . Let us look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it . And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate and I am convinced that it does let us not go back on it . Let us stick with it , implement it . We have got four more hard years of work to do to do that . I do not want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight , but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year . The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and , in the crime bill , the ban on 19 assault weapons . I do not think it is a secret to anybody in this room that several members of the last Congress who voted for that are not here tonight because they voted for it . And I know , therefore , that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it . I just have to tell you how I feel about it . The members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities . I have done it since I was a boy , and I am going to keep right on doing it until I cannot do it anymore . But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids would not have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack , and I will not let that be repealed . I will not let it be repealed . I had like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with . I want us to cut more spending , but I hope we will not cut government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy , promote responsibility , and are organized from the grassroots up , not by gederal bureaucracy . The very best example of this is the national service corps , AmeriCorps . It passed with strong bipartisan support . And now there are 20 , 000 Americans , more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps , working all over this country , helping people person to person in local grassroots volunteer groups , solving problems , and in the process earning some money for their education . This is citizenship at its best . It is good for the AmeriCorps members , but it is good for the rest of us , too . It is the essence of the New Covenant , and we should not stop it . All Americans , not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country , are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country . The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants . The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers . That is why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards , by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before , by cracking down on illegal hiring , by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens . In the budget I will present to you , we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes , to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan . We are a nation of immigrants . But we are also a nation of laws . It is wrong and ultimately self defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years , and we must do more to stop it . The most important job of our government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy . America has always been a land of opportunity , a land where , if you work hard , you can get ahead . We have become a great middle class country . Middle class values sustain us . We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass , even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy . America is once again the world s strongest economic power almost six million new jobs in the last two years , exports booming , inflation down . High wage jobs are coming back . A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream . If we want it to stay that way , those who work and lift our nation must have more of its benefits . Today , too many of those people are being left out . They are working harder for less . They have less security , less income , less certainty that they can even afford a vacation , much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves . We cannot let this continue . If we do not act , our economy will probably keep doing what it is been doing since about 1978 , when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth , and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward , no matter how hard they worked . We have got to have a government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people , a government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills . That is why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last two years , from Head Start to public schools , to apprenticeships for young people who do not go to college , to making college loans more available and more affordable . That is the first thing we have to do . We have got to do something to empower people to improve their skills . The second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes . We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under 27 , 000 , a tax cut that this year will average about 1 , 000 a family . And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses . Before we could do more than that , we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited , and we had to get economic growth up . Now we have done both . And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way . But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives . The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves , their families , and their communities . I have proposed the middle class bill of rights , which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves . It will , therefore , give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us . There are four provisions . First , a tax deduction for all education and training after high school . If you think about it , we permit businesses to deduct their investment , we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages , but today an education is even more important to the economic well being of our whole country than even those things are . We should do everything we can to encourage it . And I hope you will support it . Second , we ought to cut taxes 500 for families with children under 13 . Third , we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education , health care , first time homebuying , or the care of a parent . And fourth , we should pass a GI bill for America s workers . We propose to collapse nearly 70 federal programs and not give the money to the states but give the money directly to the American people , offer vouchers to them so that they , if they are laid off or if they are working for a very low wage , can get a voucher worth 2 , 600 a year for up to two years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives . Let us empower people in this way , move it from the government directly to the workers of America . Now , any one of us can call for a tax cut , but I will not accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk . We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly . Just two years ago , it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit . Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then , many of whom did not return , we did cut the deficit . We began to do what others said would not be done . We cut the deficit by over 600 billion , about 10 , 000 for every family in this country . It is coming down three years in a row for the first time since Truman was President , and I do not think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again . In the budget I will send you , the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy , cuts in programs , cuts in special interest subsidies . And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts . My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare . And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts . That is not the right thing to do . I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief , and some of them I find quite interesting . I really want to work with all of you . My test for our proposals will be Will it create jobs and raise incomes will it strengthen our families and support our children is it paid for will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass If it does , I will support it . But if it does not , I will not . The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage . It rewards work . Two and a half million Americans , two and a half million Americans , often women with children , are working out there today for 4 . 25 an hour . In terms of real buying power , by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40 year low . That is not my idea of how the new economy ought to work . Now , I have studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase . I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market . But the most important thing is , you cannot make a living on 4 . 25 an hour , especially if you have children , even with the working families tax cut we passed last year . In the past , the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue , and I think it should be again . So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this , to get together , to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage . Members of Congress have been here less than a month , but by the end of the week , 28 days into the new year , every member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long . Everybody else here , including the President , has something else that too many Americans do without , and that is health care . Now , last year we almost came to blows over health care , but we did not do anything . And the cold , hard fact is that , since last year , since I was here , another 1 . 1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care . And the cold , hard fact is that many millions more , most of them farmers and small business people and self employed people , have seen their premiums skyrocket , their co pays and deductibles go up . There is a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they have got is a piece of paper that says they will not lose their home if they get sick . Now , I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family . But I know that last year , as the evidence indicates , we bit off more than we could chew . So I am asking you that we work together . Let us do it step by step . Let us do whatever we have to do to get something done . Let us at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices , that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick . I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this , with the Democrats who worked on it last time , with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole , who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year . We ought to make sure that self employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools . We ought to help families provide long term care for a sick parent or a disabled child . We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work . And we can find a way it may take some time , but we can find a way to make sure that our children have health care . You know , I think everybody in this room , without regard to party , can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world s most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade . But we cannot be proud of the fact that we are the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago , the last time we were the most productive economy in the world . So let us work together on this . It is too important for politics as usual . Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we have already talked about . A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders . They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children , our streets , our health , and protecting those borders . Now that the cold war has passed , it is tempting to believe that all the security issues , with the possible exception of trade , reside here at home . But it is not so . Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy . We still cannot be strong at home unless we are strong abroad . The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point . I know it is not popular to say it tonight , but we have to act , not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico s well being . If we want to secure American jobs , preserve American exports , safeguard America s borders , then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track . Now let me repeat It is not a loan it is not foreign aid it is not a bailout . We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note , with good collateral that will cover our risks . This legislation is the right thing for America . That is why the bipartisan leadership has supported it . And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly . It is in our interest , and we can explain it to the American people because we are going to do it in the right way . You know , tonight , this is the first State of the Union address ever delivered since the beginning of the Cold War when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America . And along with the Russians , we are on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9 , 000 nuclear warheads . We have come so far so fast in this post Cold War world that it is easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted . But it is still there , and we are not finished yet . This year I will ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5 , 000 more warheads . The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty , to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban , and to eliminate chemical weapons . To stop and roll back North Korea s potentially deadly nuclear program , we will continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation . It is smart . It is tough . It is a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves . This year I will submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists , whether they strike at home or abroad . As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out , this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice . Just this week , another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more . On behalf of the American people and all of you , I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims . I know that in the face of such evil , it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward . But the terrorists represent the past , not the future . We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East . Accordingly , last night I signed an Executive Order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process . It prohibits financial transactions with these groups . And tonight I call on all our allies and peace loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism . We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis . From the day I took the oath of office , I pledged that our nation would maintain the best equipped , best trained , and best prepared military on Earth . We have , and they are . They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit . But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve , I am asking the Congress to add 25 billion in defense spending over the next six years . I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President . Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction . We ask a very great deal of our armed forces . Now that they are smaller in number , we ask more of them . They go out more often to more different places and stay longer . They are called to service in many , many ways . And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned . Just think about what our troops have done in the last year , showing America at its best , helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda , moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait , giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti . We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland , from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia , from Latin America to the Middle East . All these endeavors are good in those places , but they make our future more confident and more secure . Well , my fellow Americans , that is my agenda for America s future expanding opportunity , not bureaucracy enhancing security at home and abroad empowering our people to make the most of their own lives . It is ambitious and achievable , but it is not enough . We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy , more than a government that is smaller , smarter , and wiser , more than all of the changes we can make in government and in the private sector from the outside in . Our fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within , from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families , for our communities , and yes , for our fellow citizens . We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart , and we feel the common ground shifting from under us . The PTthe town hall meeting , the ball park , it is hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation . Too many of our children do not even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity . We all know what while we here in this chamber can make a difference on those things , that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens , where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party . When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter s league , and people would come up to me , fathers and mothers , and talk to me , I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats . When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California , northern California , last week , a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do . She hugged me and said , President , I am a Republican , but I am glad you are here . Now , why We cannot wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day , because as we move into this next century , everybody matters . We do not have a person to waste . And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better . That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody . For our corporate and business leaders , we are going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down , to expand markets , to support their success in every possible way . But they have an obligation when they are doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate . For people in the entertainment industry in this country , we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success , and we support your freedom of expression . But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant , repetitive , mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time . We have got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem , the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage . I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work . But government can only do so much . Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference . We can do this , and we must . And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders . You know , I am proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world . These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action , can reach out to all of our children , to all of the people in distress , to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear . Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference , they have a role in the New Covenant as well . There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens . You know , it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school . It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin . It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids . It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be . I know it is hard when you are working harder for less , when you are under great stress to do these things . A lot of our people do not have the time or the emotional stress , they think , to do the work of citizenship . Most of us in politics have not helped very much . For years , we have mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators , sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations . And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations . But the truth is , we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views . If you go back to the beginning of this country , the great strength of America , as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago , has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground . And in this day , everybody has a responsibility to do more of that . We simply cannot want for a tornado , a fire , or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another . I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I am trying to talk about citizens . I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election . But they represent what we ought to be doing . Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky . She gains when she gives . She is a mother of four . She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year . She was married when she was a teenager stand up , Cindy . She was married when she was a teenager . She had four children . But she had time to serve other people , to get her high school equivalency , and she is going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college . Chief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City . He is been a national leader stand up , Steve . He is been a national leader in using more police in community policing , and he is worked with AmeriCorps to do it . And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did . Corporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country s force to help secure democracy in his native land . And I might add , we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people . And he was one of them , and we are proud of him . The next two folks I have had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit , the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills , Maryland . I had like to ask them to stand . I want to tell you about them . In the early 80s , they left government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house , in the early 80s . Today that church has 17 , 000 members . It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States . It grows by 200 a month . They do it together . And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together . Two things they did make a big impression on me . I visited their church once , and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington , Dline in a higher crime , higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them . The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders , and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together , to save their marriages , and to raise their kids . This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America . We need more of it , and it ought to be lifted up and supported . The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg , Mississippi . Jack , would you stand up Fifty years ago , in the sands of Iwo Jima , Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship . On February 20 , 1945 , he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet . Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them . In that moment , he saved the lives of his companions , and miraculously in the next instant , a medic saved his life . He gained a foothold for freedom , and at the age of 17 , just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today and his son , who is a West Point graduate and a veteran at 17 , Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor . All these years later , yesterday , here s what he said about that day It did not matter where you were from or who you were , you relied on one another . You did it for your country . We all gain when we give , and we reap what we sow . That is at the heart of this New Covenant . Responsibility , opportunity , and citizenship , more than stale chapters in some remote civic book , they are still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country , the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant . I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . This is a very , very great country . And our best days are still to come . Thank you , and God bless you all .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of the 105th Congress , distinguished guests , and my fellow Americans . I think I should start by saying , thanks for inviting me back . I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime history and a plan of action to meet that challenge , to prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century . We have much to be thankful for . With four years of growth , we have won back the basic strength of our economy . With crime and welfare rolls declining , we are winning back our optimism , the enduring faith that we can master any difficulty . With the Cold War receding and global commerce at record levels , we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all across the world . My fellow Americans , the state of our Union is strong . But now we must rise to the decisive moment , to make a nation and a world better than any we have ever known . The new promise of the global economy , the information age , unimagined new work , life enhancing technology , all these are ours to seize . That is our honor and our challenge . We must be shapers of events , not observers . For if we do not act , the moment will pass , and we will lose the best possibilities of our future . We face no imminent threat , but we do have an enemy . The enemy of our time is inaction . So tonight I issue a call to action action by this Congress , action by our states , by our people , to prepare America for the 21st century action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our people action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology and science action to build stronger families and stronger communities and a safer environment action to keep America the world s strongest force for peace , freedom , and prosperity and above all , action to build a more perfect Union here at home . The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference . We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans , responsibility from all Americans , in a community of all Americans . And we must be committed to a new kind of government , not to solve all our problems for us but to give our people , all our people , the tools they need to make the most of their own lives . And we must work together . The people of this nation elected us all . They want us to be partners , not partisans . They put us all right here in the same boat , they gave us all oars , and they told us to row . Now , here is the direction I believe we should take . First , we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country , to balance the budget , renew our democracy , and finish the job of welfare reform . Over the last four years , we have brought new economic growth by investing in our people , expanding our exports , cutting our deficits , creating over 11 million new jobs , a four year record . Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world . We here tonight have an historic opportunity . Let this Congress be the Congress that finally balances the budget . Thank you . In two days , I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002 . This plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting Medicare , Medicaid , education , and the environment . It will balance the budget and build on the Vice President s efforts to make our government work better , even as it costs less . It will balance the budget and provide middle class tax relief to pay for education and health care , to help to raise a child , to buy and sell a home . Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature . It does not require us to rewrite our Constitution . I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results , such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes . Let us at least agree , we should not pass any measure no measure should be passed that threatens Social Security . Whatever your view on that , we all must concede We do not need a constitutional amendment we need action . Whatever our differences , we should balance the budget now . And then , for the long term health of our society , we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long run , so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our children as they are for our parents . And let me say something that is not in my script tonight . I know this is not going to be easy . But I really believe one of the reasons the American people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next four years that will carry our country through the next 50 years . I know it is easier for me than for you to say or do . But another reason I was elected is to support all of you , without regard to party , to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions . We owe it to our country and to our future . Our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves tonight , before the eyes of America , to finally enacting bipartisan campaign finance reform . Now , Senators McCain and Feingold , Representatives Shays and Meehan , have reached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform . Their proposal would curb spending , reduce the role of special interests , create a level playing field between challengers and incumbents , and ban contributions from noncitizens , all corporate sources , and the other large soft money contributions that both parties receive . You know and I know that this can be delayed . And you know and I know the delay will mean the death of reform . So let us set our own deadline . Let us work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain Feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy , July 4 . There is a third piece of unfinished business . Over the last four years , we moved a record two million people off the welfare rolls . Then last year , Congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation , demanding that all able bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from welfare to work . Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility , indeed , our moral obligation , to make sure that people who now must work , can work . Now we must act to meet a new goal two million more people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000 . Here is my plan Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off welfare incentives for job placement firms and states to create more jobs for welfare recipients training , transportation , and child care to help people go to work . Now I challenge every state Turn those welfare checks into private sector paychecks . I challenge every religious congregation , every community nonprofit , every business to hire someone off welfare . And I had like to say especially to every employer in our country who ever criticized the old welfare system , you cannot blame that old system anymore . We have torn it down . Now do your part . Give someone on welfare the chance to go to work . Tonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations , Sprint , Monsanto , UPBurger King , and United Airlines , will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal America s businesses , large and small , to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work . We passed welfare reform . All of you know I believe we were right to do it . But no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you are prepared to finish the job . And we must join together to do something else , too , something both Republican and Democratic Governors have asked us to do , to restore basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came to this country legally , who work hard , pay taxes , and obey the law . To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants . Now , looking ahead , the greatest step of all , the high threshold of the future we must now cross , and my number one priority for the next four years is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the world . Let us work together to meet these three goals Every 8 year old must be able to read every 12 year old must be able to log on to the Internet every 18 year old must be able to go to college and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime . My balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals , 51 billion next year . But far more than money is required . I have a plan , a call to action for American education , based on these 10 principles First , a national crusade for education standards , not federal government standards but national standards , representing what all our students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century . Every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards and train teachers to lift students up to them . To help schools meet the standards and measure their progress , we will lead an effort over the next two years to develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math . Tonight I issue a challenge to the nation Every state should adopt high national standards , and by 1999 , every state should test every 4th grader in reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these standards are met . Raising standards will not be easy , and some of our children will not be able to meet them at first . The point is not to put our children down but to lift them up . Good tests will show us who needs help , what changes in teaching to make , and which schools need to improve . They can help us end social promotions , for no child should move from grade school to junior high or junior high to high school until he or she is ready . Last month , our Secretary of Education Dick Riley and I visited Northern Illinois , where eighth grade students from 20 school districts , in a project aptly called First in the World , took the Third International Math and Science Study . That is a test that reflects the world class standards our children must meet for the new era . And those students in Illinois tied for first in the world in science and came in second in math . Two of them , Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsler , are here tonight , along with their teacher Sue Winski . They are up there with the First Lady . And they prove that when we aim high and challenge our students , they will be the best in the world . Let us give them a hand . Stand up , please . Second , to have the best schools , we must have the best teachers . Most of us in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those teachers . I know that I would not be here . For years , many of our educators , led by North Carolina s Governor Jim Hunt and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards , have worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for excellence in teaching . Just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995 . My budget will enable 100 , 000 more to seek national certification as master teachers . We should reward and recognize our best teachers . And as we reward them , we should quickly and fairly remove those few who do not measure up , and we should challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a career . Third , we must do more to help all our children read . Forty percent 40 percent of our 8 year olds cannot read on their own . That is why we have just launched the America Reads initiative , to build a citizen army of one million volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by the end of the third grade . We will use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers to mobilize this citizen army . We want at least 100 , 000 college students to help . And tonight I am pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call , pledging that thousands of their work study students will serve for one year as reading tutors . This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal . You must use these tutors to help students read . And it is especially a challenge to our parents . You must read with your children every night . This leads to the fourth principle Learning begins in the first days of life . Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking , singing , even reading to their infants . The First Lady has spent years writing about this issue , studying it . And she and I are going to convene a White House conference on early learning and the brain this spring , to explore how parents and educators can best use these startling new findings . We already know we should start teaching children before they start school . That is why this balanced budget expands Head Start to one million children by 2002 . And that is why the Vice President and Gore will host their annual family conference this June on what we can do to make sure that parents are an active part of their children s learning all the way through school . They have done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our life , and now they are turning their attention to getting more parents involved in their children s learning all the way through school . And I thank you , Vice President , and I thank you especially , Tipper , for what you do . Fifth , every state should give parents the power to choose the right public school for their children . Their right to choose will foster competition and innovation that can make public schools better . We should also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools , schools that set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do . Our plan will help America to create 3 , 000 of these charter schools by the next century , nearly seven times as there are in the country today , so that parents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best schools . Sixth , character education must be taught in our schools . We must teach our children to be good citizens . And we must continue to promote order and discipline , supporting communities that introduce school uniforms , impose curfews , enforce truancy laws , remove disruptive students from the classroom , and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in school . Seventh , we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools that are literally falling down . With the student population at an all time high and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair , this has now become a serious national concern . Therefore , my budget includes a new initiative , 5 billion to help communities finance 20 billion in school construction over the next four years . Eighth , we must make the 13th and 14th years of education , at least two years of college , just as universal in America by the 21st century as a high school education is today , and we must open the doors of college to all Americans . To do that , I propose America s HOPE scholarship , based on Georgia s pioneering program two years of a 1 , 500 tax credit for college tuition , enough to pay for the typical community college . I also propose a tax deduction of up to 10 , 000 a year for all tuition after high school , an expanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for education , and the largest increase in Pell grant scholarships in 20 years . Now , this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money they save for college tuition . I ask you to pass it and give every American who works hard the chance to go to college . Ninth , in the 21st century , we must expand the frontiers of learning across a lifetime . All our people , of whatever age , must have the chance to learn new skills . Most Americans live near a community college . The roads that take them there can be paths to a better future . My GI bill for America s workers will transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a simple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers hands . For too long , this bill has been sitting on that desk there without action . I ask you to pass it now . Let us give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime . Tenth , we must bring the power of the information age into all our schools . Last year , I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000 , so that , for the first time in our history , children in the most isolated rural towns , the most comfortable suburbs , the poorest inner city schools , will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge . That is my plan , a call to action for American education . Some may say that it is unusual for a President to pay this kind of attention to education . Some may say it is simply because the President and his wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than they can recall . That is not what is driving these proposals . We must understand the significance of this endeavor One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the cold war was a bipartisan foreign policy because our future was at stake , politics stopped at the water s edge . Now I ask you and I ask all our nation s Governors I ask parents , teachers , and citizens all across America for a new nonpartisan commitment to education because education is a critical national security issue for our future , and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door . To prepare America for the 21st century , we must harness the powerful forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans . This is the first State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet . But we have only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should become the modern birthright of every citizen . Our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning . Now we should connect every hospital to the Internet , so that doctors can instantly share data about their patients with the best specialists in the field . And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every children s hospital as soon as possible , so that a child in bed can stay in touch with school , family , and friends . A sick child need no longer be a child alone . We must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds 1 , 000 times faster than today , to develop new medical treatments , new sources of energy , new ways of working together . But we cannot stop there . As the Internet becomes our new town square , a computer in every home , a teacher of all subjects , a connection to all cultures , this will no longer be a dream but a necessity . And over the next decade , that must be our goal . We must continue to explore the heavens , pressing on with the Mars probes and the international space station , both of which will have practical applications for our everyday living . We must speed the remarkable advances in medical science . The human genome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life . American scientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its effects and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with HIV and AIDS . Since I took office , funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health has increased dramatically to 1 . 5 billion . With new resources , NIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine , working with other scientists to finally end the threat of AIDRemember that every year every year we move up the discovery of an AIDS vaccine will save millions of lives around the world . We must reinforce our commitment to medical science . To prepare America for the 21st century , we must build stronger families . Over the past four years , the family and medical leave law has helped millions of Americans to take time off to be with their families . With new pressures on people in the way they work and live , I believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and a child s medical checkup . We should pass flex time , so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families . We must continue , step by step , to give more families access to affordable , quality health care . Forty million Americans still lack health insurance . Ten million children still lack health insurance 80 percent of them have working parents who pay taxes . That is wrong . My balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to five million of those children . Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance do so because their parents lose or change a job , my budget will also ensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep their health insurance . No child should be without a doctor just because a parent is without a job . My Medicare plan modernizes Medicare , increases the life of the Trust Fund to 10 years , provides support for respite care for the many families with loved ones afflicted with Alzheimer s , and for the first time , it would fully pay for annual mammograms . Just as we ended drive through deliveries of babies last year , we must now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the hospital only hours after a mastectomy . I ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy . With us tonight is Kristen Zarfos , a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spurred a national movement and inspired this legislation . I had like her to stand so we can thank her for her efforts . Zarfos , thank you . In the last four years , we have increased child support collections by 50 percent . Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this , his or her most sacred obligation . Finally , we must also protect our children by standing firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that endanger their lives . To prepare America for the 21st century , we must build stronger communities . We should start with safe streets . Serious crime has dropped five years in a row . The key has been community policing . We must finish the job of putting 100 , 000 community police on the streets of the United States . We should pass the victims rights amendment to the Constitution . And I ask you to mount a full scale assault on juvenile crime , with legislation that declares war on gangs , with new prosecutors and tougher penalties extends the Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use and helps to keep our schools open after hours , on weekends , and in the summer , so our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to . This balanced budget includes the largest antidrug effort ever , to stop drugs at their source , punish those who push them , and teach our young people that drugs are wrong , drugs are illegal , and drugs will kill them . I hope you will support it . Our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural neighborhoods . But we must do more to empower them to create the conditions in which all families can flourish and to create jobs through investment by business and loans by banks . We should double the number of empowerment zones . They have already brought so much hope to communities like Detroit , where the unemployment rate has been cut in half in four years . We should restore contaminated urban land and buildings to productive use . We should expand the network of community development banks . And together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach , including private sector tax incentives , to renew our Capital City , so that Washington is a great place to work and live and once again the proud face America shows the world . We must protect our environment in every community . In the last four years , we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites , as many as in the previous 12 . Now we should clean up 500 more , so that our children grow up next to parks , not poison . I urge you to pass my proposal to make big polluters live by a simple rule If you pollute our environment , you should pay to clean it up . In the last four years , we strengthened our nation s safe food and clean drinking water laws we protected some of America s rarest , most beautiful land in Utah s Red Rocks region , created three new national parks in the California desert , and began to restore the Florida Everglades . Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands . Tonight , I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage Rivers , to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and clean up pollution in the rivers , proving once again that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment . We must also protect our global environment , working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate . Now , we all know that in all of our communities , some of our children simply do not have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or schools or neighborhoods . And that means the rest of us must do more , for they are our children , too . That is why President Bush , General Colin Powell , former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join the Vice President and me to lead the President s summit of service in Philadelphia in April . Our national service program , AmeriCorps , has already helped 70 , 000 young people to work their way through college as they serve America . Now we intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways . Citizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans should embrace , and I ask your support for that endeavor . I had like to make just one last point about our national community . Our economy is measured in numbers and statistics , and it is very important . But the enduring worth of our nation lies in our shared values and our soaring spirit . So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the arts and humanities , I believe we should stand by them and challenge our artists , musicians , and writers , challenge our museums , libraries , and theaters . We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with our fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the American spirit in every community , a celebration of our common culture in the century that has passed and in the new one to come in the new millennium , so that we can remain in the world s beacon not only of liberty but of creativity , long after the fireworks have faded . To prepare America for the 21st century , we must master the forces of change in the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an uncharted time . Fifty years ago , a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that secured victory in the cold war and built a growing world economy . As a result , today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our interests . Already we have dismantled many of the blocs and barriers that divided our parents world . For the first time , more people live under democracy than dictatorship , including every nation in our own hemisphere but one , and its day , too , will come . Now , we stand at another moment of change and choice and another time to be farsighted , to bring America 50 more years of security and prosperity . In this endeavor , our first task is to help to build , for the very first time , an undivided , democratic Europe . When Europe is stable , prosperous , and at peace , America is more secure . To that end , we must expand NATO by 1999 , so that countries that were once our adversaries can become our allies . At the special NATO summit this summer , that is what we will begin to do . We must strengthen NATO s Partnership For Peace with non member allies . And we must build a stable partnership between NATO and a democratic Russia . An expanded NATO is good for America and a Europe in which all democracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to each other but in terms of what they can do together for the good of all that kind of Europe is good for America . Second , America must look to the East no less than to the West . Our security demands it . Americans fought three wars in Asia in this century . Our prosperity requires it . More than two million American jobs depend upon trade with Asia . There , too , we are helping to shape an Asia Pacific community of cooperation , not conflict . Let our progress there not mask the peril that remains . Together with South Korea , we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge the cold war s last divide . And I call on Congress to fund our share of the agreement under which North Korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program . We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China for the sake of our interests and our ideals . An isolated China is not good for America a China playing its proper role in the world is . I will go to China , and I have invited China s President to come here , not because we agree on everything but because engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges like ending nuclear testing and to deal frankly with our fundamental differences like human rights . The American people must prosper in the global economy . We have worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home . I am proud to say that today America is once again the most competitive nation and the number one exporter in the world . Now we must act to expand our exports , especially to Asia and Latin America , two of the fastest growing regions on Earth , or be left behind as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations . That is why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values . We need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy . After all , we have the best workers and the best products . In a truly open market , we can out compete anyone , anywhere on Earth . But this is about more than economics . By expanding trade , we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world . There is no better example of this truth than Latin America where democracy and open markets are on the march together . That is why I will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important tie . We should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor Mexico from its economic crises . And we should all be proud that last month Mexico repaid the United States , three full years ahead of schedule , with half a billion dollar profit to us . America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace from the Middle East to Haiti , from Northern Ireland to Africa . Taking reasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later . With American leadership , the killing has stopped in Bosnia . Now the habits of peace must take hold . The new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate . Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support of our troops . They are doing a remarkable job there for America , and America must do right by them . Fifth , we must move strongly against new threats to our security . In the past four years , we agreed to ban we led the way to a worldwide agreement to ban nuclear testing . With Russia , we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals , and we stopped targeting each others citizens . We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and to rid the world of landmines . We are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug traffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully accountable if they do . Now we must rise to a new test of leadership , ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention . Make no mistake about it , it will make our troops safer from chemical attack it will help us to fight terrorism . We have no more important obligations , especially in the wake of what we now know about the Gulf War . This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning , supported by Republican and Democratic administrations and Republican and Democratic Members of Congress and already approved by 68 nations . But if we do not act by April 29 , when this convention goes into force with or without us , we will lose the chance to have Americans leading and enforcing this effort . Together we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law , so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison gas from the Earth . Finally , we must have the tools to meet all these challenges . We must maintain a strong and ready military . We must increase funding for weapons modernization by the year 2000 , and we must take good care of our men and women in uniform . They are the world s finest . We must also renew our commitment to America s diplomacy and pay our debts and dues to international financial institutions like the World Bank and to a reforming United Nations . Every dollar we devote to preventing conflicts , to promoting democracy , to stopping the spread of disease and starvation , brings a sure return in security and savings . Yet international affairs spending today is just one percent of the federal budget , a small fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war . If America is to continue to lead the world , we here who lead America simply must find the will to pay our way . A farsighted America moved the world to a better place over these last 50 years . And so it can be for another 50 years . But a shortsighted America will soon find its words falling on deaf ears all around the world . Almost exactly 50 years ago , in the first winter of the Cold War , President Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership . This was his warning he said , If we falter , we may endanger the peace of the world , and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation . That Congress , led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenberg , answered President Truman s call . Together , they made the commitments that strengthened our country for 50 years . Now let us do the same . Let us do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation , to keep America strong , secure , and prosperous for another 50 years . In the end , more than anything else , our world leadership grows out of the power of our example here at home , out of our ability to remain strong as one America . All over the world , people are being torn asunder by racial , ethnic , and religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror . We are the world s most diverse democracy , and the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences . America has always been a nation of immigrants . From the start , a steady stream of people in search of freedom and opportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home . We started as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans . We have grown into an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise . My fellow Americans , we must never , ever believe that our diversity is a weakness . It is our greatest strength . Americans speak every language , know every country . People on every continent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great potential , and they always will , as long as we strive to give all of our citizens , whatever their background , an opportunity to achieve their own greatness . We are not there yet . We still see evidence of abiding bigotry and intolerance in ugly words and awful violence , in burned churches and bombed buildings . We must fight against this , in our country and in our hearts . Just a few days before my second Inauguration , one of our country s best known pastors , Reverend Robert Schuller , suggested that I read Isaiah 58 12 . Here s what it says Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach , the restorer of paths to dwell in . I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office , on behalf of all Americans , for no matter what our differences in our faiths , our backgrounds , our politics , we must all be repairers of the breach . I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how . Congressman Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday , a proud American whose family came from Mexico . He was only 51 years old . He was awarded the Silver Star , the Bronze Star , and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam . And he went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future here in this Chamber . We are grateful for his service and honored that his mother , Lillie Tejeda , and his sister , Mary Alice , have come from Texas to be with us here tonight . And we welcome you . Gary Locke , the newly elected Governor of Washington State , is the first Chinese American Governor in the history of our country . He is the proud son of two of the millions of Asian American immigrants who have strengthened America with their hard work , family values , and good citizenship . He represents the future we can all achieve . Thank you , Governor , for being here . Please stand up . Reverend Schuller , Congressman Tejeda , Governor Locke , along with Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsler , Sue Winski and Kristen Zarfos , they are all Americans from different roots whose lives reflect the best of what we can become when we are one America . We may not share a common past , but we surely do share a common future . Building one America is our most important mission , the foundation for many generations of every other strength we must build for this new century . Money cannot buy it . Power cannot compel it . Technology cannot create it . It can only come from the human spirit . America is far more than a place . It is an idea , the most powerful idea in the history of nations . And all of us in this Chamber , we are now the bearers of that idea , leading a great people into a new world . A child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century . Everything that child will know about America will be because of what we do now to build a new century . We do not have a moment to waste . Tomorrow there will be just over 1 , 000 days until the year 2000 1 , 000 days to prepare our people 1 , 000 days to work together 1 , 000 days to build a bridge to a land of new promise . My fellow Americans , we have work to do . Let us seize those days and the century . Thank you , God bless you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Dawson , you did your men proud today . General Shalikashvili , Cronkite , Chaplain , distinguished leaders of our Government , Members of Congress , members of the armed services , our hosts from France , and most of all , our veterans , their families , and their friends In these last days of ceremonies , we have heard wonderful words of tribute . Now we come to this hallowed place that speaks , more than anything else , in silence . Here on this quiet plateau , on this small piece of American soil , we honor those who gave their lives for us 50 crowded years ago . Today , the beaches of Normandy are calm . If you walk these shores on a summer s day , all you might hear is the laughter of children playing on the sand or the cry of seagulls overhead or perhaps the ringing of a distant church bell , the simple sounds of freedom barely breaking the silence , peaceful silence , ordinary silence . But June 6th , 1944 , was the least ordinary day of the 20th century . On that chilled dawn , these beaches echoed with the sounds of staccato gunfire , the roar of aircraft , the thunder of bombardment . And through the wind and the waves came the soldiers , out of their landing craft and into the water , away from their youth and toward a savage place many of them would sadly never leave . They had come to free a continent , the Americans , the British , the Canadians , the Poles , the French Resistance , the Norwegians , and others they had all come to stop one of the greatest forces of evil the world has ever known . As news of the invasion broke back home in America , people held their breath . In Boston , commuters stood reading the news on the electric sign at South Station . In New York , the Statue of Liberty , its torch blacked out since Pearl Harbor , was lit at sunset for 15 minutes . And in Newcastle , Pennsylvania , a young mother named Pauline Elliot wrote to her husband , Frank , a corporal in the Army , D Day has arrived . The first thought of all of us was a prayer . Below us are the beaches where Corporal Elliot s battalion and so many other Americans landed , Omaha and Utah , proud names from America s heartland , part of the biggest gamble of the war , the greatest crusade , yes , the longest day . During those first hours on bloody Omaha , nothing seemed to go right . Landing craft were ripped apart by mines and shells . Tanks sent to protect them had sunk , drowning their crews . Enemy fire raked the invaders as they stepped into chest high water and waded past the floating bodies of their comrades . And as the stunned survivors of the first wave huddled behind a seawall , it seemed the invasion might fail . Hitler and his followers had bet on it . They were sure the Allied soldiers were soft , weakened by liberty and leisure , by the mingling of races and religion . They were sure their totalitarian youth had more discipline and zeal . But then something happened . Although many of the American troops found themselves without officers on unfamiliar ground , next to soldiers they did not know , one by one they got up . They inched forward , and together , in groups of threes and fives and tens , the sons of democracy improvised and mounted their own attacks . At that exact moment on these beaches , the forces of freedom turned the tide of the 20th century . These soldiers knew that staying put meant certain death . But they were also driven by the voice of free will and responsibility , nurtured in Sunday schools , town halls , and sandlot ballgames , the voice that told them to stand up and move forward , saying , You can do it . And if you do not , no one else will . And as Captain Joe Dawson led his company up this bluff , and as others followed his lead , they secured a foothold for freedom . Today many of them are here among us . Oh , they may walk with a little less spring in their step , and their ranks are growing thinner , but let us never forget when they were young , these men saved the world . And so let us now ask them , all the veterans of the Normandy campaign , to stand if they can and be recognized . The freedom they fought for was no abstract concept , it was the stuff of their daily lives . Listen to what Frank Elliot had written to his wife from the embarkation point in England I miss hamburgers la Coney Island , American beer la Duquesne , American shows la Penn Theater , and American girls la you . Pauline Elliot wrote back on June 6th , as she and their one year old daughter listened on the radio , Little DeRonda is the only one not affected by D Day news . I hope and pray she will never remember any of this , but only the happiness of the hours that will follow her daddy s homecoming step on the porch . Well , millions of our GI s did return home from that war to build up our nations and enjoy life s sweet pleasures . But on this field there are 9 , 386 who did not 33 pairs of brothers , a father and his son , 11 men from tiny Bedford , Virginia , and Corporal Frank Elliot , killed near these bluffs by a German shell on D Day . They were the fathers we never knew , the uncles we never met , the friends who never returned , the heroes we can never repay . They gave us our world . And those simple sounds of freedom we hear today are their voices speaking to us across the years . At this place , let us honor all the Americans who lost their lives in World War ILet us remember , as well , that over 40 million human beings from every side perished soldiers on the field of battle , Jews in the ghettos and death camps , civilians ravaged by shell fire and famine . May God give rest to all their souls . Fifty years later , what a different world we live in . Germany , Japan , and Italy , liberated by our victory , now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom . Russia , decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war , has been reborn in democracy . And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev , the liberation of this continent is nearly complete . Now the question falls to our generation How will we build upon the sacrifice of D Day s heroes Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach , we cannot stand still . We cannot stay safe by doing so . Avoiding today s problems would be our own generation s appeasements . For just as freedom has a price , it also has a purpose , and its name is progress . Today , our mission is to expand freedom s reach forward to test the full potential of each of our own citizens to strengthen our families , our faith , and our communities to fight indifference and intolerance to keep our Nation strong and to light the lives of those still dwelling in the darkness of undemocratic rule . Our parents did that and more we must do nothing less . They struggled in war so that we might strive in peace . We know that progress is not inevitable . But neither was victory upon these beaches . Now , as then , the inner voice tells us to stand up and move forward . Now , as then , free people must choose . Fifty years ago , the first Allied soldiers to land here in Normandy came not from the sea but from the sky . They were called Pathfinders , the first paratroopers to make the jump . Deep in the darkness , they descended upon these fields to light beacons for the airborne assaults that would soon follow . Now , near the dawn of a new century , the job of lighting those beacons falls to our hands . To you who brought us here , I promise we will be the new pathfinders , for we are the children of your sacrifice . Thank you , and God bless you all .<speech_sep>Thank you . Wait a minute , folks , I have got to get these crutches right here . Thank you , General Hess . Let me begin by thanking everyone who is a part of the Grand Forks Air Force Base for what you do for our national security and especially for what you have done to support the people of the Grand Forks communities in these last few days . I am very proud of you . Thank you . As I think all of you know , I have just come from touring the devastation of the floods as well as a very moving community meeting , presided over by Mayor Owens , attended by Mayor Stauss and other mayors , the entire congressional delegation from North Dakota and from South Dakota , Senator Grams and Senator Wellstone from Minnesota , Congressman Collin Peterson from Minnesota , and the Governors from North Dakota and Minnesota . It has been a very moving experience for all of us . Five members of my Cabinet are here , the Secretaries of Agriculture , Health and Human Services , Housing and Urban Development , Transportation , and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration . The Secretary of the Army is here . We have all come , first of all , to see firsthand what it is you have been going through secondly , to pledge to do our part to help make you whole and thirdly , to tell you that we are for you . We have hardly ever seen such a remarkable demonstration of courage and commitment and cooperation and basic human strength , and we are very impressed and proud to be Americans when we see what you have done in the face of this terrible disaster . We know that this rebuilding is going to be a long term prospect , and we also know that there are some very immediate and pressing human needs that many people have . Before I left this morning , I took some steps I wanted to tell you about . First , I authorized James Lee Witt and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide 100 percent of the direct Federal assistance for all the emergency work going to be undertaken here . The second thing we did was to add to the counties already covered another 18 counties in Minnesota and 53 in South Dakota who need help . The third thing I did was to ask Congress to approve another 200 million in emergency funds for North Dakota , South Dakota , and Minnesota . These funds will be available for both short term emergency response activities and for long term efforts to help you rebuild . If approved , this action will bring to 488 million the total amount of disaster assistance that I have requested for the people of these three States . Now , let me say there are I say again , I know there are short term , immediate concerns , people who need a place to sleep , people who do not know where their next check is coming from , even people who do not have access to basic sanitary facilities except here on the air base . We are working to restore those things with your local community folks . And we had some specific talks about what we could do to get proper housing available while you are rebuilding your communities . That is up there . Anybody hurt Well , we have had a fire , a flood , a blizzard I guess we can take a . So anyway , we will have our folks here , and there will be lots of them . And let me just say , this is going to be these next few days our FEMA Director , James Lee Witt , and I have been working on these things a long time . He was my emergency director when I was Governor of Arkansas . I know what is going to happen . I have been through floods and tornadoes and terrible losses . The next few days are going to be very , very hard on a lot of people . A lot of you who have been very , very brave and courageous , helped your friends and neighbors , are going to it is going to sink in on you what you have been through and what has been lost . And I want to encourage all of you to really look out for each other in the next few days and be sensitive to the enormous emotional pressures that some of you will feel and also kind of be good to yourselves . Understand you do not have to be ashamed if you are heartbroken . But it is going to be tough in the next few days . But I also want you to feel very resolute about the long run . I have asked Director Witt to head an interagency task force to develop a long term plan for what our responsibilities are to help you rebuild and be stronger and better than ever . And believe me , it may be hard to believe now , but you can rebuild stronger and better than ever . And we are going to help you do that . And we want you to keep your eyes on that future . Let me also say , as I go back to Washington to ask the Congress to approve this emergency package , I will never forget what I have seen and heard here . Four of your community leaders who played various roles in the last several weeks , Ken Vein , Jim Shothorse , Randy Johnson , and Curt Kruen , talked to me and to others in the meeting a few moments ago . I have seen the pictures of people battling the flames of the fire in the rising floods . I have seen rescue workers working around the clock even as they lost their own homes . I have seen people pitching in to rescue books from the University of North Dakota library . I have read the last 3 days editions of this newspaper . How in the world they kept producing the newspaper for you is beyond me . And you ought to be very proud of them for doing that . I read this morning that there is a message board right here that is covered with offers for free housing all around . And that is the kind of spirit that will get everyone through this . With all the losses , I hope when this is bearing down on you in the next few days , you will remember the enormous courage and shared pride and values and support that all of you have given each other . You have shown that when we think of our duties to one another , our own lives are better , that we are all stronger when we try to make sure our friends and neighbors are safe and strong as well . And no matter what you have lost in this terrible flood , what you have saved and strengthened and sharpened and shown to the world is infinitely better . And you should be very , very proud of that . I saw something your mayor said the other day that struck me in particular . She said , What makes a community a place to live in is not the buildings . It is the people , the spirit , and faith that are in those people . Water cannot wash that away , and fire cannot burn that away , and a blizzard cannot freeze that away . And if you do not give it away , it will bring you back better than ever . And we will be there with you every step of the way . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , my fellow Americans , before I begin my words tonight I would like to ask that we all bow in a moment of silent prayer for the memory of those who were killed and those who have been injured in the tragic train accident in Alabama today . Amen . My fellow Americans , tonight we come together to write a new chapter in the American story . Our forebears enshrined the American dream life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness . Every generation of Americans has worked to strengthen that legacy , to make our country a place of freedom and opportunity , a place where people who work hard can rise to their full potential , a place where their children can have a better future . From the settling of the frontier to the landing on the Moon , ours has been a continuous story of challenges defined , obstacles overcome , new horizons secured . That is what makes America what it is and Americans what we are . Now we are in a time of profound change and opportunity . The end of the cold war , the information age , the global economy have brought us both opportunity and hope and strife and uncertainty . Our purpose in this dynamic age must be to make change our friend and not our enemy . To achieve that goal , we must face all our challenges with confidence , with faith , and with discipline , whether we are reducing the deficit , creating tomorrow s jobs and training our people to fill them , converting from a high tech defense to a high tech domestic economy , expanding trade , reinventing Government , making our streets safer , or rewarding work over idleness . All these challenges require us to change . If Americans are to have the courage to change in a difficult time , we must first be secure in our most basic needs . Tonight I want to talk to you about the most critical thing we can do to build that security . This health care system of ours is badly broken , and it is time to fix it . Despite the dedication of literally millions of talented health care professionals , our health care is too uncertain and too expensive , too bureaucratic and too wasteful . It has too much fraud and too much greed . At long last , after decades of false starts , we must make this our most urgent priority , giving every American health security , health care that can never be taken away , heath care that is always there . That is what we must do tonight . On this journey , as on all others of true consequence , there will be rough spots in the road and honest disagreements about how we should proceed . After all , tills is a complicated issue . But every successful journey is guided by fixed stars . And if we can agree on some basic values and principles , we will reach tills destination , and we will reach it together . So tonight I want to talk to you about the principles that I believe must embody our efforts to reform America s health care system security , simplicity , savings , choice , quality , and responsibility . When I launched our Nation on this journey to reform the health care system I knew we needed a talented navigator , someone with a rigorous mind , a steady compass , a caring heart . Luckily for me and for our Nation , I did not have to look very far . Over the last 8 months , Hillary and those working with her have talked to literally thousands of Americans to understand the strengths and the frailties of this system of ours . They met with over 1 , 100 health care organizations . They talked with doctors and nurses , pharmacists and drug company representatives , hospital administrators , insurance company executives , and small and large businesses . They spoke with self employed people . They talked with people who had insurance and people who did not . They talked with union members and older Americans and advocates for our children . The First Lady also consulted , as all of you know , extensively with governmental leaders in both parties in the States of our Nation and especially here on Capitol Hill . Hillary and the task force received and read over 700 , 000 letters from ordinary citizens . What they wrote and the bravery with which they told their stories is really what calls us all here tonight . Every one of us knows someone who is worked hard and played by the rules and still been hurt by this system that just does not work for too many people . But I had like to tell you about just one . Kerry Kennedy owns a small furniture store that employs seven people in Titusville , Florida . Like most small business owners , he is poured his heart and soul , his sweat and blood into that business for years . But over the last several years , again like most small business owners , he is seen his health care premiums skyrocket , even in years when no claims were made . And last year , he painfully discovered he could no longer afford to provide coverage for all his workers because his insurance company told him that two of his workers had become high risks because of their advanced age . The problem wits that those two people were his mother and father , the people who founded the business and still work in the store . This story speaks for millions of others . And from them we have learned a powerful truth . We have to preserve and strengthen what is right with the health care system , but we have got to fix what is wrong with it . Now , we all know what is right . We are blessed with the best health care professionals on Earth , the finest health care institutions , the best medical research , the most sophisticated technology . My mother is a nurse . I grew up around hospitals . Doctors and nurses were the first professional people I ever knew or learned to look up to . They are what is right with this health care system . But we also know that we can no longer afford to continue to ignore what is wrong . Millions of Americans are just a pink slip away from losing their health insurance and one serious illness away from losing all their savings . Millions more are locked into the jobs they have now just because they or someone in their family has once been sick and they have what is called the preexisting condition . And on any given day , over 37 million Americans , most of them working people and their little children , have no health insurance at all . And in spite of all this , our medical bills are growing at over twice the rate of inflation , and the United States spends over a third more of its income on health care than any other nation on Earth . And the gap is growing , causing many of our companies in global competition severe disadvantage . There is no excuse for this kind of system . We know other people have done better . We know people in our own country are doing better . We have no excuse . My fellow Americans , we must fix this system , and it has to begin with congressional action . I believe as strongly as I can say that we can reform the costliest and most wasteful system on the face of the Earth without enacting new broad based taxes . I believe it because of the conversations I have had with thousands of health care professionals around the country , with people who are outside this city but are inside experts on the way this system works and wastes money . The proposal that I describe tonight borrows many of the principles and ideas that have been embraced in plans introduced by both Republicans and Democrats in this Congress . For the first time in this century , leaders of both political parties have joined together around the principle of providing universal , comprehensive health care . It is a magic moment , and we must seize it . I want to say to all of you I have been deeply moved by the spirit of this debate , by the openness of all people to new ideas and argument and information . The American people would he proud to know that earlier this week when a health care university was held for Members of Congress just to try to give everybody the same amount of information , over 320 Republicans and Democrats signed up and showed up for 2 days just to learn the basic facts of the complicated problem before us . Both sides are willing to say , We have listened to the people . We know the cost of going forward with this system is far greater than the cost of change . Both sides , I think , understand the literal ethical imperative of doing something about the system we have now . Rising above these difficulties and our past differences to solve this problem will go a long way toward defining who we are and who we intend to be as a people in this difficult and challenging era . I believe we all understand that . And so tonight , let me ask all of you , every Member of the House , every Member of the Senate , each Republican and each Democrat , let us keep this spirit and let us keep this commitment until this job is done . We owe it to the American people . Thank you . Thank you very much . Now , if I might , I would like to review the six principles I mentioned earlier and describe how we think we can best fulfill those principles . First and most important , security . This principle speaks to the human misery , to the costs , to the anxiety we hear about every day , all of us , when people talk about their problems with the present system . Security means that those who do not now have health care coverage will have it , and for those who have it , it will never be taken away . We must achieve that security as soon as possible . Under our plan , every American would receive a health care security card that will guarantee a comprehensive package of benefits over the course of an entire lifetime , roughly comparable to the benefit package offered by most Fortune 500 companies . This health care security card will offer this package of benefits in a way that can never be taken away . So let us agree on this Whatever else we disagree on , before this Congress finishes its work next year , you will pass and I will sign legislation to guarantee this security to every citizen of this country . With this card , if you lose your job or you switch jobs , you are covered . If you leave your job to start a small business , you are covered . If you are an early retiree , you are covered . If someone in your family has unfortunately had an illness that qualifies as a preexisting condition , you are still covered . If you get sick or a member of your family gets sick , even if it is a life threatening illness , you are covered . And if an insurance company tries to drop you for any reason , you will still be covered , because that will be illegal . This card will give comprehensive coverage . It will cover people for hospital care , doctor visits , emergency and lab services , diagnostic services like Pap smears and mammograms and cholesterol tests , substance abuse , and mental health treatment . And equally important , for both health care and economic reasons , this program for the first time would provide a broad range of preventive services including regular checkups and well baby visits . Now , it is just common sense . We know , any family doctor will tell you , that people will stay healthier and long term costs of the health system will be lower if we have comprehensive preventive services . You know how all of our mothers told us that an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure Our mothers were right . And it is a lesson , like so many lessons from our mothers , that we have waited too long to live by . It is time to start doing it . Health care security must also apply to older Americans . This is something I imagine all of us in this room feel very deeply about . The first thing I want to say about that is that we must maintain the Medicare program . It works to provide that kind of security . But this time and for the first time , I believe Medicare should provide coverage for the cost of prescription drugs . Yes , it will cost some more in the beginning . But again , any physician who deals with the elderly will tell you that there are thousands of elderly people in every State who are not poor enough to be on Medicaid but just above that line and on Medicare , who desperately need medicine , who make decisions every week between medicine and food . Any doctor who deals with the elderly will tell you that there are many elderly people who do not get medicine , who get sicker and sicker and eventually go to the doctor and wind up spending more money and draining more money from the health care system than they would if they had regular treatment in the way that only adequate medicine can provide . I also believe that over time , we should phase in long term care for the disabled and the elderly on a comprehensive basis . As we proceed with this health care reform , we cannot forget that the most rapidly growing percentage of Americans are those over 80 . We cannot break faith with them . We have to do better by them . The second principle is simplicity . Our heath care system must be simpler for the patients and simpler for those who actually deliver health care our doctors , our nurses , our other medical professionals . Today we have more than 1 , 500 insurers , with hundreds and hundreds of different forms . No other nation has a system like this . These forms are time consuming for health care providers . They are expensive for health care consumers . They are exasperating for anyone who is ever tried to sit down around a table and wade through them and figure them out . The medical care industry is literally drowning in paperwork . In recent years , the number of administrators in our hospitals has grown by 4 times the rate that the number of doctors has grown . A hospital ought to be a house of healing , not a monument to paperwork and bureaucracy . Just a few days ago , the Vice President and I had the honor of visiting the Children s Hospital here in Washington where they do wonderful , often miraculous things for very sick children . A nurse named Debbie Freiberg told us that she was in the cancer and bone marrow unit . The other day a little boy asked her just to stay at his side during his chemotherapy . And she had to walk away from that child because she had been instructed to go to yet another class to learn how to fill out another form for something that did not have a lick to do with the health care of the children she was helping . That is wrong , and we can stop it , and we ought to do it . We met a very compelling doctor named Lillian Beard , a pediatrician , who said that she did not get into her profession to spend hours and hours some doctors up to 25 hours a week just filling out forms . She told us she became a doctor to keep children well and to help save those who got sick . We can relieve people like her of this burden . We learned , the Vice President and I did , that in the Washington Children s Hospital alone , the administrators told us they spend 2 million a year in one hospital filling out forms that have nothing whatever to do with keeping up with the treatment of the patients . And the doctors there applauded when I was told and I related to them that they spend so much time filling out paperwork , that if they only had to fill out those paperwork requirements necessary to monitor the heath of the children , each doctor on that one hospital staff , 200 of them , could see another 500 children a year . That is 10 , 000 children a year . I think we can save money in this system if we simplify it . And we can make the doctors and the nurses and the people that are giving their lives to help us all be healthier a whole lot happier , too , on their jobs . Under our proposal there would be one standard insurance form , not hundreds of them . We will simplify also and we must the Government s rules and regulations , because they are a big part of this problem . This is one of those cases where the physician should heal thyself . We have to reinvent the way we relate to the health care system , along with reinventing Government . A doctor should not have to check with a bureaucrat in an office thousands of miles away before ordering a simple blood test . That is not right , and we can change it . And doctors , nurses , and consumers should not have to worry about the fine print . If we have this one simple form , there will not be any fine print . People will know what it means . The third principle is savings . Reform must produce savings in this health care system . It has to . We are spending over 14 percent of our income on health care . Canada s at 10 . Nobody else is over 9 . We are competing with all these people for the future . And the other major countries , they cover everybody , and they cover them with services as generous as the best company policies here in this country . Rampant medical inflation is eating away at our wages , our savings , our investment capital , our ability to create new jobs in the private sector , and this public Treasury . You know the budget we just adopted had steep cuts in defense , a 5 year freeze on the discretionary spending , so critical to reeducating America and investing in jobs and helping us to convert from a defense to a domestic economy . But we passed a budget which has Medicaid increases of between 16 and 11 percent a year over the next 5 years and Medicare increases of between 11 and 9 percent in an environment where we assume inflation will be at 4 percent or less . We cannot continue to do this . Our competitiveness , our whole economy , the integrity of the way the Government works , and ultimately , our living standards depend upon our ability to achieve savings without harming the quality of heath care . Unless we do this , our workers will lose 655 in income each year by the end of the decade . Small businesses will continue to face skyrocketing premiums . And a full third of small businesses now covering their employees say they will be forced to drop their insurance . Large corporations will bear bigger disadvantages in global competition . And health care costs devour more and more and more of our budget . Pretty soon all of you or the people who succeed you will be showing up here and writing out checks for health care and interest on the debt and worrying about whether we have got enough defense , and that will be it , unless we have the courage to achieve the savings that are plainly there before us . Every State and local government will continue to cut back on everything from education to law enforcement to pay more and more for the same health care . These rising costs are a special nightmare for our small businesses , the engine of our entrepreneurship and our job creation in America today . Health care premiums for small businesses are 35 percent higher than those of large corporations today . And they will keep rising at double digit rates unless we act . So how will we achieve these savings Rather than looking at price control or looking away as the price spiral continues , rather than using the heavy hand of Government to try to control what is happening or continuing to ignore what is happening , we believe there is a third way to achieve these savings . First , to give groups of consumers and small businesses the same market bargaining power that large corporations and large groups of public employees now have , we want to let market forces enable plans to compete . We want to force these plans to compete on the basis of price and quality , not simply to allow them to continue making money by turning people away who are sick or old or performing mountains of unnecessary procedures . But we also believe we should back this system up with limits on how much plans can raise their premiums year in and year out , forcing people , again , to continue to pay more for the same health care , without regard to inflation or the rising population needs . We want to create what has been missing in this system for too long and what every successful nation who has dealt with this problem has already had to do to have a combination of private market forces and a sound public policy that will support that competition , but limit the rate at which prices can exceed the rate of inflation and population growth , if the competition does not work , especially in the early going . The second thing I want to say is that unless everybody is covered and this is a very important thing unless everybody is covered , we will never be able to fully put the brakes on health care inflation . Why is that Because when people do not have any health insurance , they still get health care , but they get it when it is too late , when it is too expensive , often from the most expensive place of all , the emergency room . Usually by the time they show up , their illnesses are more severe , and their mortality rates are much higher in our hospitals than those who have insurance . So they cost us more . And what else happens Since they get the care but they do not pay , who does pay All the rest of us . We pay in higher hospital bills and higher insurance premiums . This cost shifting is a major problem . The third thing we can do to save money is simply by simplifying the system , what we have already discussed . Freeing the health care providers from these costly and unnecessary paperwork and administrative decisions will save tens of billions of dollars . We spend twice as much as any other major country does on paperwork . We spend at least a dime on the dollar more than any other major country . That is a stunning statistic . It is something that every Republican and every Democrat ought to be able to say , we agree that we are going to squeeze this out . We cannot tolerate this . This has nothing to do with keeping people well or helping them when they are sick . We should invest the money in something else . We also have to crack down on fraud and abuse in the system . That drains billions of dollars a year . It is a very large figure , according to every health care expert I have ever spoken with . So I believe we can achieve large savings . And that large savings can be used to cover the unemployed , uninsured and will be used for people who realize those savings in the private sector to increase their ability to invest and grow , to hire new workers or to give their workers pay raises , many of them for the first time in years . Now , nobody has to take my word for this . You can ask Koop . He is up here with us tonight , and I thank him for being here . Since he left his distinguished tenure as our Surgeon General , he has spent an enormous amount of time studying our health care system , how it operates , what is right and wrong with it . He says we could spend 200 billion every year , more than 20 percent of the total budget , without sacrificing the high quality of American medicine . Ask the public employees in California , who have held their own premiums down by adopting the same strategy that I want every American to be able to adopt , bargaining within the limits of a strict budget . Ask Xerox , which saved an estimated 1 , 000 per worker on their health insurance premium . Ask the staff of the Mayo Clinic , who we all agree provides some of the finest health care in the world . They are holding their cost increases to less than half the national average . Ask the people of Hawaii , the only State that covers virtually all of their citizens and has still been able to keep costs below the national average . People may disagree over the best way to fix this system . We may all disagree about how quickly we can do the thing that we have to do . But we cannot disagree that we can find tens of billions of dollars in savings in what is clearly the most costly and the most bureaucratic system in the entire world . And we have to do something about that , and we have to do it now . The fourth principle is choice . Americans believe they ought to be able to choose their own health care plan and keep their own doctors . And I think all of us agree . Under any plan we pass , they ought to have that right . But today , under our broken heath care system , in spite of the rhetoric of choice , the fact is that that power is slipping away for more and more Americans . Of course , it is usually the employer , not the employee , who makes the initial choice of what health care plan the employee will be in . And if your employer offers only one plan , as nearly three quarters of small or medium sized firms do today , you are stuck with that plan and the doctors that it covers . I propose to give every American a choice among high quality plans . You can stay with your current doctor , join a network of doctors and hospitals , or join a health maintenance organization . If you do not like your plan , every year you will have a chance to choose a new one . The choice will be left to the American citizen , the worker , not the boss and certainly not some Government bureaucrat . We also believe that doctors should have a choice as to what plans they practice in . Otherwise , citizens may have their own choices limited . We want to end the discrimination that is now growing against doctors and to permit them to practice in several different plans . Choice is important for doctors , and it is absolutely critical for our consumers . We have got to have it in whatever plan we pass . The fifth principle is quality . If we reformed everything else in health care but failed to preserve and enhance the high quality of our medical care , we will have taken a step backward , not forward . Quality is something that we simply cannot leave to chance . When you board an airplane , you feel better knowing that the plane had to meet standards designed to protect your safety . And we cannot ask any less of our health care system . Our proposal will create report cards on health plans , so that consumers can choose the highest quality health care providers and reward them with their business . At the same time , our plan will track quality indicators , so that doctors can make better and smarter choices of the kind of care they provide . We have evidence that more efficient delivery of health care does not decrease quality . In fact , it may enhance it . Let me just give you one example of one commonly performed procedure , the coronary bypass operation . Pennsylvania discovered that patients who were charged 21 , 000 for this surgery received as good or better care as patients who were charged 84 , 000 for the same procedure in the same State . High prices simply do not always equal good quality . Our plan will guarantee that high quality information is available in even the most remote areas of this country so that we can have high quality service , linking rural doctors , for example , with hospitals with high tech urban medical centers . And our plan will ensure the quality of continuing progress on a whole range of issues by speeding research on effective prevention and treatment measures for cancer , for AIDfor Alzheimer s , for heart disease , and for other chronic diseases . We have to safeguard the finest medical research establishment in the entire world . And we will do that with this plan . Indeed , we will even make it better . The sixth and final principle is responsibility . We need to restore a sense that we are all in this together and that we all have a responsibility to be a part of the solution . Responsibility has to start with those who profit from the current system . Responsibility means insurance companies should no longer be allowed to cast people aside when they get sick . It should apply to laboratories that submit fraudulent bills , to lawyers who abuse malpractice claims , to doctors who order unnecessary procedures . It means drug companies should no longer charge 3 times more per prescription drugs , made in America here in the United States , than they charge for the same drugs overseas . In short , responsibility should apply to anybody who abuses this system and drives up the cost for honest , hard working citizens and undermines confidence in the honest , gifted health care providers we have . Responsibility also means changing some behaviors in this country that drive up our costs like crazy . And without changing it we will never bare the system we ought to have , we will never . Let me just mention a few and start with the most important The outrageous costs of violence in this country stein in large measure from the fact that this is the only country in the world where teenagers can rout the streets at random with semiautomatic weapons and be better armed than the police . But let us not kid ourselves it is not that simple . We also have higher rates of AIDof smoking and excessive drinking , of teen pregnancy , of low birth weight babies . And we have the third worst immunization rate of any nation in the Western Hemisphere . We have to change our ways if we ever really want to be healthy as a people and have an affordable health care system . And no one can deny that . But let me say this and I hope every American will listen , because this is not an easy thing to hear responsibility in our health care system is not just about them . It is about you . It is about me . It is about each of us . Too many of us have not taken responsibility for our own health care and for our own relations to the health care system . Many of us who have had fully paid health care plans have used the system whether we needed it or not without thinking what the costs were . Many people who use this system do not pay a penny for their care even though they can afford to . I think those who do not have any health insurance should be responsible for paying a portion of their new coverage . There cannot be any something for nothing , and we have to demonstrate that to people . This is not a free system . Even small contributions , as small as the 10 copayment when you visit a doctor , illustrates that this is something of value . There is a cost to it . It is not free . And I want to tell you that I believe that all of us should have insurance . Why should the rest of us pick up the tab when a guy who does not think he needs insurance or says he cannot afford it gets in an accident , winds up in an emergency room , gets good care , and everybody else pays Why should the small business people who are struggling to keep afloat and take care of their employees have to pay to maintain this wonderful health care infrastructure for those who refuse to do anything If we are going to produce a better health care system for every one of us , every one of us is going to have to do our part . There cannot be any such thing as a free ride . We have to pay for it . We have to pay for it . Tonight I want to say plainly how I think we should do that . Most of the money will come , under my way of thinking , as it does today , from premiums paid by employers and individuals . That is the way it happens today . But under this health care security plan , every employer and every individual will be asked to contribute something to health care . This concept was first conveyed to the Congress about 20 years ago by President Nixon . And today , a lot of people agree with the concept of shared responsibility between employers and employees and that the best thing to do is to ask every employer and every employee to share that . The Chamber of Commerce has said that , and they are not in the business of hurting small business . The American Medical Association has said that . Some call it an employer mandate , but I think it is the fairest way to achieve responsibility in the heath care system . And it is the easiest for ordinary Americans to understand because it builds on what we already have and what already works for so many Americans . It is the reform that is not only easiest to understand but easiest to implement in a way that is fair to small business , because we can give a discount to help struggling small businesses meet the cost of covering their employees . We should require the east bureaucracy or disruption and create the cooperation we need to make the system cost conscious , even as we expand coverage . And we should do it in a way that does not cripple small businesses and low wage workers . Every employer should provide coverage , just as three quarters do now . Those that pay are picking up the tab for those who do not today . I do not think that is right . To finance the rest of reform , we can achieve new savings , as I have outlined , in both the Federal Government and the private sector through better decision making and increased competition . And we will impose new taxes on tobacco . I do not think that should be the only source of revenues . I believe we should also ask for a modest contribution from big employers who opt out of the system to make up for what those who are in the system pay for medical research , for health education centers , for all the subsidies to small business , for all the things that everyone else is contributing to . But between those two things , we believe we can pay for this package of benefits and universal coverage and a subsidy program that will help small business . These sources can cover the cost of the proposal that I have described tonight . We subjected the numbers in our proposal to the scrutiny of not only all the major agencies in Government I know a lot of people do not trust them , but it would be interesting for the American people to know that this was the first time that the financial experts on health care in all of the different Government agencies have ever been required to sit in the room together and agree on numbers . It had never happened before . But obviously , that is not enough . So then we gave these numbers to actuaries from major accounting firms and major Fortune 500 companies who have no stake in this other than to see that our efforts succeed . So I believe our numbers are good and achievable . Now , what does this mean to an individual American citizen Some will be asked to pay more . If you are an employer and you are not insuring your workers at all , you will have to pay more . But if you are a small business with fewer than 50 employees , you will get a subsidy . If you are a firm that provides only very limited coverage , you may have to pay more . But some firms will pay the same or less for more coverage . If you are a young , single person in your twenties and you are already insured , your rates may go up somewhat because you are going to go into a big pool with middle aged people and older people , and we want to enable people to keep their insurance even when someone in their family gets sick . But I think that is fair because when the young get older they will benefit from it , first , and secondly , even those who pay a little more today will benefit 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 years from now by our bringing health care costs closer to inflation . Over the long run , we can all win . But some will have to pay more in the short run . Nevertheless , the vast majority of the Americans watching this tonight will pay the same or less for health care coverage that will be the same or better than the coverage they have tonight . That is the central reality . If you currently get your health insurance through your job , under our plan you still will . And for the first time , everybody will get to choose from among at least three plans to belong to . If you are a small business owner who wants to provide health insurance to your family and your employees , but you cannot afford it because the system is stacked against you , this plan will give you a discount that will finally make insurance affordable . If you are already providing insurance , your rates may well drop because we will help you as a small business person join thousands of others to get the same benefits big corporations get at the same price they get those benefits . If you are self employed , you will pay less , and you will get to deduct from your taxes 100 percent of your health care premiums . If you are a large employer , your health care costs will not go up as fast , so that you will have more money to put into higher wages and new jobs and to put into the work of being competitive in this tough global economy . Now , these , my fellow Americans , are the principles on which I think we should base our efforts security , simplicity , savings , choice , quality , and responsibility . These are the guiding stars that we should follow on our journey toward health care reform . Over the coming months , you will be bombarded with information from all kinds of sources . There will be some who will stoutly disagree with what I have proposed and with all other plans in the Congress , for that matter . And some of the arguments will be genuinely sincere and enlightening . Others may simply be scare tactics by those who are motivated by the self interest they have in the waste the system now generates , because that waste is providing jobs , incomes , and money for some people . I ask you only to think of this when you hear all of these arguments Ask yourself whether the cost of staying on this same course is not greater than the cost of change . And ask yourself , when you hear the arguments , whether the arguments are in your interest or someone else s . This is something we have got to try to do together . I want also to say to the Representatives in Congress , you have a special duty to look beyond these arguments . I ask you instead to look into the eyes of the sick child who needs care , to think of the face of the woman who is been told not only that her condition is malignant but not covered by her insurance , to look at the bottom lines of the businesses driven to bankruptcy by health care costs , to look at the for sale signs in front of the homes of families who have lost everything because of their health care costs . I ask you to remember the kind of people I met over the last year and a half the elderly couple in New Hampshire that broke down and cried because of their shame at having an empty refrigerator to pay for their drags a woman who lost a 50 , 000 job that she used to support her six children because her youngest child was so ill that she could not keep health insurance , and the only way to get care for the child was to get public assistance a young couple that had a sick child and could only get insurance from one of the parents employers that was a nonprofit corporation with 20 employees , and so they had to face the question of whether to let this poor person with a sick child go or raise the premiums of every employee in the firm by 200 and on and on and on . I know we have differences of opinion , but we are here tonight in a spirit that is animated by the problems of those people and by the sheer knowledge that if we can look into our heart , we will not be able to say that the greatest nation in the history of the world is powerless to confront this crisis . Our history and our heritage tell us that we can meet this challenge . Everything about America s past tells us we will do it . So I say to you , let us write that new chapter in the American story . Let us guarantee every American comprehensive health benefits that can never be taken away . You know , in spite of all the work we have done together and all the progress we have made , there is still a lot of people who say it would be an outright miracle if we passed health care reform . But my fellow Americans , in a time of change you have to have miracles . And miracles do happen . I mean , just a few days ago we saw a simple handshake shatter decades of deadlock in the Middle East . We have seen the walls crumble in Berlin and South Africa . We see the ongoing brave struggle of the people of Russia to seize freedom and democracy . And now it is our turn to strike a blow for freedom in this country , the freedom of Americans to live without fear that their own Nation s health care system will not be there for them when they need it . It is hard to believe that there was once a time in this century when that kind of fear gripped old age , when retirement was nearly synonymous with poverty and older Americans died in the street . That is unthinkable today , because over a half a century ago Americans had the courage to change , to create a Social Security System that ensures that no Americans will be forgotten in their later years . Forty years from now , our grandchildren will also find it unthinkable that there was a time in this country when hardworking families lost their homes , their savings , their businesses , lost everything simply because their children got sick or because they had to change jobs . Our grandchildren will find such things unthinkable tomorrow if we have the courage to change today . This is our chance . This is our journey . And when our work is done , we will know that we have answered the call of history and met the challenge of our time . Thank you very much , and God bless America .<speech_sep>First , let me thank you , President , and Vice President Kagame , and your wives for making Hillary and me and our delegation feel so welcome . I had also like to thank the young students who met us and the musicians , the dancers who were outside . I thank especially the survivors of the genocide and those who are working to rebuild your country for spending a little time with us before we came in here . I have a great delegation of Americans with me , leaders of our Government , leaders of our Congress , distinguished American citizens . We are all very grateful to be here . We thank the diplomatic corps for being here , and the members of the Rwandan Government , and especially the citizens . I have come today to pay the respects of my Nation to all who suffered and all who perished in the Rwandan genocide . It is my hope that through this trip , in every corner of the world today and tomorrow , their story will be told that 4 years ago in this beautiful , green , lovely land , a clear and conscious decision was made by those then in power that the peoples of this country would not live side by side in peace . During the 90 days that began on April 6 , in 1994 , Rwanda experienced the most extensive slaughter in this blood filled century we are about to leave families murdered in their homes , people hunted down as they fled by soldiers and militia , through farmland and woods as if they were animals . From Kibuye in the west to Kibungo in the east , people gathered seeking refuge in churches by the thousands , in hospitals , in schools . And when they were found , the old and the sick , the women and children alike , they were killed killed because their identity card said they were Tutsi or because they had a Tutsi parent or because someone thought they looked like a Tutsi or slain , like thousands of Hutus , because they protected Tutsis or would not countenance a policy that sought to wipe out people who just the day before , and for years before , had been their friends and neighbors . The Government led effort to exterminate Rwanda s Tutsi and moderate Hutus , as you know better than me , took at last a million lives . Scholars of these sorts of events say that the killers , armed mostly with machetes and clubs , nonetheless did their work 5 times as fast as the mechanized gas chambers used by the Nazis . It is important that the world know that these killings were not spontaneous or accidental . It is important that the world hear what your President just said They were most certainly not the result of ancient tribal struggles . Indeed , these people had lived together for centuries before the events the President described began to unfold . These events grew from a policy aimed at the systematic destruction of a people . The ground for violence was carefully prepared , the airwaves poisoned with hate , casting the Tutsis as scapegoats for the problems of Rwanda , denying their humanity . All of this was done , clearly , to make it easy for otherwise reluctant people to participate in wholesale slaughter . Lists of victims , name by name , were actually drawn up in advance . Today , the images of all that , haunt us all the dead choking the Kigara River , floating to Lake Victoria . In their fate , we are reminded of the capacity for people everywhere , not just in Rwanda , and certainly not just in Africa but the capacity for people everywhere , to slip into pure evil . We cannot abolish that capacity , but we must never accept it . And we know it can be overcome . The international community , together with nations in Africa , must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy , as well . We did not act quickly enough after the killing began . We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe havens for the killers . We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name genocide . We cannot change the past , but we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear and full of hope . We owe to those who died and to those who survived who loved them , our every effort to increase our vigilance and strengthen our stand against those who would commit such atrocities in the future , here or elsewhere . Indeed , we owe to all the peoples of the world who are at risk because each bloodletting hastens the next as the value of human life is degraded and violence becomes tolerated , the unimaginable becomes more conceivable we owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events . And where they cannot be prevented , we can move more quickly to minimize the horror . So let us challenge ourselves to build a world in which no branch of humanity , because of national , racial , ethnic , or religious origin , is again threatened with destruction because of those characteristics of which people should rightly be proud . Let us work together as a community of civilized nations to strengthen our ability to prevent and , if necessary , to stop genocide . To that end , I am directing my administration to improve , with the international community , our system for identifying and spotlighting nations in danger of genocidal violence , so that we can assure worldwide awareness of impending threats . It may seem strange to you here , especially the many of you who lost members of your family , but all over the world there were people like me sitting in offices , day after day after day , who did not fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror . We have seen , too and I want to say again that genocide can occur anywhere . It is not an African phenomenon and must never be viewed as such . We have seen it in industrialized Europe we have seen it in Asia . We must have global vigilance . And never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence . Secondly , we must , as an international community , have the ability to act when genocide threatens . We are working to create that capacity here in the Great Lakes region , where the memory is still fresh . This afternoon in Entebbe leaders from central and eastern Africa will meet with me to launch an effort to build a coalition to prevent genocide in this region . I thank the leaders who have stepped forward to make this commitment . We hope the effort can be a model for all the world , because our sacred task is to work to banish this greatest crime against humanity . Events here show how urgent the work is . In the northwest part of your country , attacks by those responsible for the slaughter in 1994 continue today . We must work as partners with Rwanda to end this violence and allow your people to go on rebuilding your lives and your nation . Third , we must work now to remedy the consequences of genocide . The United States has provided assistance to Rwanda to settle the uprooted and restart its economy , but we must do more . I am pleased that America will become the first nation to contribute to the new Genocide Survivors Fund . We will contribute this year 2 million , continue our support in the years to come , and urge other nations to do the same , so that survivors and their communities can find the care they need and the help they must have . President , to you , and to you , Vice President , you have shown great vision in your efforts to create a single nation in which all citizens can live freely and securely . As you pointed out , Rwanda was a single nation before the European powers met in Berlin to carve up Africa . America stands with you , and will continue helping the people of Rwanda to rebuild their lives and society . You spoke passionately this morning in our private meeting about the need for grassroots efforts , for the development projects which are bridging divisions and clearing a path to a better future . We will join with you to strengthen democratic institutions , to broaden participation , to give all Rwandans a greater voice in their own governance . The challenges you face are great , but your commitment to lasting reconciliation and inclusion is firm . Fourth , to help ensure that those who survived , in the generations to come , never again suffer genocidal violence , nothing is more vital than establishing the rule of law . There can be no place in Rwanda that lasts without a justice system that is recognized as such . We applaud the efforts of the Rwandan Government to strengthen civilian and military justice systems . I am pleased that our Great Lakes Justice Initiative will invest 30 million to help create throughout the region judicial systems that are impartial , credible , and effective . In Rwanda these funds will help to support courts , prosecutors , and police , military justice , and cooperation at the local level . We will also continue to pursue justice through our strong backing for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda . The United States is the largest contributor to this tribunal . We are frustrated , as you are , by the delays in the tribunal s work . As we know , we must do better . Now that administrative improvements have begun , however , the tribunal should expedite cases through group trials and fulfill its historic mission . We are prepared to help , among other things , with witness relocation , so that those who still fear can speak the truth in safety . And we will support the war crimes tribunal for as long as it is needed to do its work , until the truth is clear and justice is rendered . Fifth , we must make it clear to all those who would commit such acts in the future that they too must answer for their acts , and they will . In Rwanda , we must hold accountable all those who may abuse human rights , whether insurgents or soldiers . Internationally , as we meet here , talks are underway at the United Nations to establish a permanent international criminal court . Rwanda and the difficulties we have had with this special tribunal underscores the need for such a court . And the United States will work to see that it is created . I know that in the face of all you have endured , optimism cannot come easily to any of you . Yet I have just spoken , as I said , with several Rwandans who survived the atrocities , and just listening to them gave me reason for hope . You see countless stories of courage around you every day as you go about your business here , men and women who survived and go on , children who recover the light in their eyes remind us that at the dawn of a new millennium there is only one crucial division among the peoples of the Earth . And believe me , after over 5 years of dealing with these problems , I know it is not the divisions between Hutu and Tutsi or Serb or Croatian and Muslim and Bosnian or Arab and Jew or Catholic and Protestant in Ireland , or black and white . It is really the line between those who embrace the common humanity we all share and those who reject it . It is the line between those who find meaning in life through respect and cooperation and who , therefore , embrace someone to look down on , someone to trample , someone to punish and , therefore , embrace war . It is the line between those who look to the future and those who cling to the past . It is the line between those who give up their resentment and those who believe they will absolutely die if they have to release one bit grievance . It is the line between those who confront every day with a clenched fist and those who confront every day with an open hand . That is the only line that really counts when all is said and done . To those who believe that God made each of us in His own image , how could we choose the darker road When you look at those children who greeted us as we got off that plane today , how could anyone say they did not want those children to have a chance to have their own children , to experience the joy of another morning sunrise , to learn the normal lessons of life , to give something back to their people When you strip it all away , whether we are talking about Rwanda or some other distant troubled spot , the world is divided according to how people believe they draw meaning from life . And so I say to you , though the road is hard and uncertain and there are many difficulties ahead , and like every other person who wishes to help , I doubltless will not be able to do everything I would like to do , there are things we can do . And if we set about the business of doing them together , you can overcome the awful burden that you have endured . You can put a smile on the face of every child in this country , and you can make people once again believe that they should live as people were living who were singing to us and dancing for us today . That is what we have to believe . That is what I came here to say . And that is what I wish for you . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of the 105th Congress , distinguished guests , my fellow Americans Since the last time we met in this chamber , America has lost two patriots and fine public servants . Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle , Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people . In the past few weeks they have both been eulogized . Tonight I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our nation . For 209 years it has been the President s duty to report to you on the state of the Union . Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people , these are good times for America . We have more than 14 million new jobs , the lowest unemployment in 24 years , the lowest core inflation in 30 years incomes are rising and we have the highest homeownership in history . Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row , and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years . Our leadership in the world is unrivaled . Ladies and gentlemen , the state of our Union is strong . But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century , this is not a time to rest . It is a time to build , to build the America within reach , an America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work where every citizen can live in a safe community where families are strong , schools are good , and all our young people can go on to college an America where scientists find cures for diseases , from diabetes to Alzheimer s to AIDan America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written , every painting ever painted , every symphony ever composed where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities an America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity . This is the America we have begun to build this is the America we can leave to our children if we join together to finish the work at hand . Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century . Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time . Quietly , but with gathering force , the ground has shifted beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age , a global economy , a truly new world . For five years now , we have met the challenge of these changes , as Americans have at every turning point in our history , by renewing the very idea of America widening the circle of opportunity , deepening the meaning of our freedom , forging a more perfect Union . We shaped a new kind of government for the information age . I thank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a government that is leaner , more flexible , a catalyst for new ideas , and most of all , a government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives . We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer . My fellow Americans , we have found a third way . We have the smallest government in 35 years , but a more progressive one . We have a smaller government , but a stronger nation . We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century an economy that offers opportunity , a society rooted in responsibility , and a nation that lives as a community . First , Americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth investments in education and skills , in science and technology and transportation , to prepare our people for the new economy new markets for American products and American workers . When I took office , the deficit for 1998 was projected to be 357 billion and heading higher . This year , our deficit is projected to be 10 billion and heading lower . For three decades , six Presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation . Tonight I come before you to announce that the federal deficit , once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros , will be , simply , zero . I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years . And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline , we may balance the budget this year four years ahead of schedule . You can all be proud of that , because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle . It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent , and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress . Here s the really good news If we maintain our resolve , we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see . We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit . Last year , together , we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years . My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families , for education , for child care , for the environment . But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending , I ask all of you to meet this test Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit . Now , if we balance the budget for next year , it is projected that we will then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow . What should we do with this projected surplus I have a simple four word answer Save Social Security first . Thank you . Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus that is every penny of any surplus until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century . Let us say to all Americans watching tonight whether you are 70 or 50 , or whether you just started paying into the system Social Security will be there when you need it . Let us make this commitment Social Security first . Let us do that together . I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion , in facing these issues squarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed . We will start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country , and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate . We will hold a White House conference on Social Security in December . And one year from now I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic , bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century . Thank you . In an economy that honors opportunity , all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity . Because these times are good , we can afford to take one simple , sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families We should raise the minimum wage . The information age is , first and foremost , an education age , in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime . Last year , from this podium , I said that education has to be our highest priority . I laid out a 10 point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door . Since then , this Congress across party lines and the American people have responded , in the most important year for education in a generation , expanding public school choice , opening the way to 3 , 000 new charter schools , working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway , committing to expand Head Start to a million children , launching America Reads , sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8 year olds can read . Last year I proposed and you passed 220 , 000 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students . Student loans , already less expensive and easier to repay now you get to deduct the interest . Families all over America now can put their savings into new tax free education IRAs . And this year , for the first two years of college , families will get a 1 , 500 tax credit a HOPE scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition . And for junior and senior year , graduate school , and job training , there is a lifetime learning credit . You did that , and you should be very proud of it . And because of these actions , I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight Your children can go on to college . If you know a child from a poor family , tell her not to give up she can go on to college . If you know a young couple struggling with bills , worried they will not be able to send their children to college , tell them not to give up their children can go on to college . If you know somebody who is caught in a dead end job and afraid he cannot afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life , tell him not to give up he can go on to college . Because of the things that have been done , we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today . And my friends , that will change the face and future of America . We have opened wide the doors of the world s best system of higher education . Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world s best as well by raising standards , raising expectations , and raising accountability . Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year , we will soon have , for the very first time , a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math . Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics . And every parent already knows the key good teachers and small classes . Tonight I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades . Thank you . My balanced budget will help to hire 100 , 000 new teachers who have passed a state competency test . Now , with these teachers listen with these teachers , we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first , second , and third grades to an average of 18 students a class , all across America . If I have got the math right , more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms . So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5 , 000 schools . We must also demand greater accountability . When we promote a child from grade to grade who has not mastered the work , we do not do that child any favors . It is time to end social promotion in America s schools . Last year , in Chicago , they made that decision not to hold our children back but to lift them up . Chicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up . I propose to help other communities follow Chicago s lead . Let us say to them Stop promoting children who do not learn , and we will give you the tools to make sure they do . I also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children , starting in the sixth grade , so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they , too , will be able to go on to college . As we enter the 21st century , the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world . We must shape this global economy , not shrink from it . In the last five years , we have led the way in opening new markets , with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp Made in the USA . Today , record high exports account for fully one third of our economic growth . I want to keep them going , because that is the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer , more stable world . All of you know , whatever your views are , that I think this is a great opportunity for America . I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements . I have listened carefully , and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears first , that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors , even if there is more business and , second , that if we have more trade , more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over . I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world . I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda . But we cannot influence other countries decisions if we send them a message that we are backing away from trade with them . This year I will send legislation to Congress , and ask other nations to join us , to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all abusive child labor . We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology , which may have nothing to do with trade . That is why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993 . And if my new budget is adopted , we will triple funding . That is why we must do more , and more quickly , to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason . You know , we help communities in a special way when their military base closes we ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes . Again , I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI bill for workers , a simple skills grant so people can , on their own , move quickly to new jobs , to higher incomes , and brighter futures . We all know , in every way in life , change is not always easy , but we have to decide whether we are going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits . And remember the big picture here While we have been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements , we have been creating millions of new jobs . So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America , Asia , and Europe . And we should pass the new African Trade Act it has bipartisan support . I will also renew my request for the fast track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets , create more new jobs , which every President has had for two decades . You know , whether we like it or not , in ways that are mostly positive , the world s economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent . Today , an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere . Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand , Indonesia , South Korea , and beyond . Now , why should Americans be concerned about this First , these countries are our customers . If they sink into recession , they will not be able to buy the goods we had like to sell them . Second , they are also our competitors . So if their currencies lose their value and go down , then the price of their goods will drop , flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods , which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete . And finally , they are our strategic partners . Their stability bolsters our security . The American economy remains sound and strong , and I want to keep it that way . But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world s economies , including ours , making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world . Our policy is clear No nation can recover if it does not reform itself . But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform , we should help them do it . So I call on Congress to renew America s commitment to the International Monetary Fund . And I think we should say to all the people we are trying to represent here that preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder till the clouds are just overhead . A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility . A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work , not welfare . We can be proud that after decades of finger pointing and failure , together we ended the old welfare system . And we are now replacing welfare checks with paychecks . Last year , after a record four year decline in welfare rolls , I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000 . I am pleased to report we have also met that goal , two full years ahead of schedule . This is a grand achievement , the sum of many acts of individual courage , persistence , and hope . For 13 years , Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis , Indiana , was on and off welfare . Today , she is a dispatcher with a van company . She is saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood , and she is helping other welfare recipients go to work . Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution . There are millions like her all across America . And I am happy she could join the First Lady tonight . Elaine , we are very proud of you . Please stand up . We still have a lot more to do , all of us , to make welfare reform a success providing child care , helping families move closer to available jobs , challenging more companies to join our welfare to work partnership , increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children . I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard , and I hope you will finish that job this year . We have to make it possible for all hard working families to meet their most important responsibilities . Two years ago we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs . Last year we extended health care to up to five million children . This year , I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps . A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans . These plans save money , and they can improve care . But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors , not insurance company accountants . I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this You have the right to know all your medical options , not just the cheapest . You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need . You have the right to emergency room care , wherever and whenever you need it . You have the right to keep your medical records confidential . Traditional care or managed care , every American deserves quality care . Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance . Some are retired some are laid off some lose their coverage when their spouses retire . After a lifetime of work , they are left with nowhere to turn . So I ask the Congress , let these hard working Americans buy into the Medicare system . It will not add a dime to the deficit , but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless . Next , we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face an epidemic of teen smoking , spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns . I challenge Congress Let us pass bipartisan , comprehensive legislation that will improve public health , protect our tobacco farmers , and change the way tobacco companies do business forever . Let us do what it takes to bring teen smoking down . Let us raise the price of cigarettes by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next 10 years , with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children . Tomorrow , like every day , 3 , 000 children will start smoking , and 1 , 000 will die early as a result . Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives . In the new economy , most parents work harder than ever . They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents . The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as President in 1993 . Since then , about 15 million people have taken advantage of it , and I have met a lot of them all across this country . I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children s teachers or take them to the doctor . Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work . Last year I cohosted the very first White House Conference on Child Care with one of our foremost experts , America s First Lady . From all corners of America , we heard the same message , without regard to region or income or political affiliation We have got to raise the quality of child care . We have got to make it safer . We have got to make it more affordable . So here s my plan Help families to pay for child care for a million more children scholarships and background checks for child care workers , and a new emphasis on early learning tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees and a larger child care tax credit for working families . Now , if you pass my plan , what this means is that a family of four with an income of 35 , 000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of Federal income tax . I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience . I have often wondered how my mother , when she was a young widow , would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents had not been able to take care of me . She and I were really very lucky . How many other families have never had that same opportunity The truth is , we do not know the answer to that question . But we do know what the answer should be Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love . A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets , safe schools , and safe neighborhoods . We pursued a strategy of more police , tougher punishment , smarter prevention , with crimefighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups , where the rubber hits the road . I can report to you tonight that it is working . Violent crime is down robbery is down assault is down burglary is down for five years in a row , all across America . We need to finish the job of putting 100 , 000 more police on our streets . Again , I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers , to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs , and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life . And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after school programs . I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night . We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets , and we ought to do it . Drug use is on the decline . I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership , and I thank this Congress for passing the largest antidrug budget in history . Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1 , 000 new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders . Police , prosecutors , and prevention programs , as good as they are , they cannot work if our court system does not work . Today there are large number of vacancies in the federal courts . Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice . I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified judicial nominees before you , up or down . We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world . On the eve of a new century , we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security . But make no mistake about it , today s possibilities are not tomorrow s guarantees . America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism . We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists , international criminals , and drug traffickers . These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people . And they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands . To meet these challenges , we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century , protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not . Within days , I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary , Poland , and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATFor 50 years , NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure . Now these three formerly Communist countries have said yes to democracy . I ask the Senate to say yes to them , our new allies . By taking in new members and working closely with new partners , including Russia and Ukraine , NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century . Next , I will ask Congress to continue its support of our troops and their mission in Bosnia . This Christmas , Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation . We saw children playing in the streets , where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells . The shops are filled with food the cafes were alive with conversation . The progress there is unmistakable , but it is not yet irreversible . To take firm root , Bosnia s fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June . I think Senator Dole actually said it best . He said , This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game . Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory . I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla . They are very proud of what they are doing in Bosnia , and we are all very proud of them . One of those thank you one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the First Lady tonight Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert . His father was a decorated Vietnam vet . After college in Colorado , he joined the Army . Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia . Thank you very much , Sergeant , for what you represent . Please stand up . In Bosnia and around the world , our men and women in uniform always do their mission well . Our mission must be to keep them well trained and ready , to improve their quality of life , and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy . I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction . This year , four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower , a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach . By ending nuclear testing , we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non nuclear states to build them . I am pleased to announce that four former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Generals John Shalikashvili , Colin Powell , and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe have endorsed this treaty . And I ask the Senate to approve it this year . Thank you . Together , we must confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states , terrorists , and organized criminals seeking to acquire them . Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation s wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people but on developing nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them . The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job finding and destroying more of Iraq s arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War . Now Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission . I know I speak for everyone in this chamber , Republicans and Democrats , when I say to Saddam Hussein , You cannot defy the will of the world , and when I say to him , You have used weapons of mass destruction before . We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again . Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas . Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror . The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now . The rules are good , but the enforcement is weak . We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating . In the months ahead , I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan , from South America to China . And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East , America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace . Finally , it is long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations . Thank you . More and more , we are working with other nations to achieve common goals . If we want America to lead , we have got to set a good example . As we see so clearly in Bosnia , allies who share our goals can also share our burdens . In this new era , our freedom and independence are actually enriched , not weakened , by our increasing interdependence with other nations . But we have to do our part . Our Founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect Union . To all of you I say , it is a journey we can only make together , living as one community . First , we have to continue to reform our government , the instrument of our national community . Everyone knows elections have become too expensive , fueling a fundraising arms race . This year , by March 6 , at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold . Let us be clear A vote against McCain Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo . I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year . At least equally important , we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs the high cost of media advertising . To the folks watching at home , those were the groans of pain in the audience . I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily . The airwaves are a public trust , and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy . Under the leadership of Vice President Gore , we have reduced the federal payroll by 300 , 000 workers , cut 16 , 000 pages of regulation , eliminated hundreds of programs , and improved the operations of virtually every government agency . But we can do more . Like every taxpayer , I am outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRWe need some changes there new citizen advocacy panels , a stronger taxpayer advocate , phone lines open 24 hours a day , relief for innocent taxpayers . Last year , by an overwhelming bipartisan margin , the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms . This bill must not now languish in the Senate . Tonight I ask the Senate Follow the House pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business . I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on , so I will be out of trouble . A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities . For the past five years , we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas , with community development banks , more commercial loans in the poor neighborhoods , cleanup of polluted sites for development . Under the continued leadership of the Vice President , we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas . We should thank you we should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own , and we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low income housing . Last year , this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia . Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here . Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas . They are still the gateways for new immigrants , from every continent , who come here to work for their own American dreams . Let us keep our cities going strong into the 21st century they are a very important part of our future . Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe , the water they drink , the Earth they will inherit . Last year we put in place the toughest ever controls on smog and soot . We moved to protect Yellowstone , the Everglades , Lake Tahoe . We expanded every community s right to know about the toxins that threaten their children . Just yesterday , our food safety plan took effect , using new science to protect consumers from dangers like coli and salmonella . Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative , a far reaching effort to clean our rivers , our lakes , and our coastal waters for our children . Thank you . Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change , global warming , the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action . The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we do not reduce the emission of greenhouse gases , at some point in the next century , we will disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk . This past December , America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces , new technologies , energy efficiency . We have it in our power to act right here , right now . I propose 6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation , renewable energy , fuel efficient cars , energy efficient homes . Every time we have acted to heal our environment , pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy . Well , today our economy is the strongest in a generation , and our environment is the cleanest in a generation . We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time . And when it comes to global warming , we will do it again . Finally , community means living by the defining American value , the ideal heard round the world that we are all created equal . Throughout our history , we have not always honored that ideal and we have never fully lived up to it . Often it is easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common . It may be easier , but it is wrong . What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation what do we have to do We are becoming more and more and more diverse . Do you believe we can become one nation The answer cannot be to dwell on our differences but to build on our shared values . We all cherish family and faith , freedom and responsibility . We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities . I have launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America . Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome . Discrimination against any American is un American . We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal . I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice , and we should act now to end their wait . We also should recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans , without regard to race . When we open the doors of college to all Americans , when we rid all our streets of crime , when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods , when we make sure all parents have the child care they need , we are helping to build one nation . We , in this chamber and in this government , must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America . But we will only move forward if all our fellow citizens , including every one of you at home watching tonight , is also committed to this cause . We must work together , learn together , live together , serve together . On the forge of common enterprise , Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity . We see it today in the United States military , in the Peace Corps , in AmeriCorps . Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance , we do just fine . With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communication and citizen service , we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect . We are many we must be one . In that spirit , let us lift our eyes to the new millennium . How will we mark that passage It just happens once every 1 , 000 years . This year Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America s creativity and innovation , and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century . Our culture lives in every community , and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans . We should protect them . I am proposing a public private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving American s treasures , great and small . And while we honor the past , let us imagine the future . Now , think about this The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years . In the 1980s , scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis it took nine years . Last year scientists located the gene that causes Parkinson s Disease in only nine days . Within a decade , gene chips will offer a roadmap for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime . Soon we will be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother s Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair . A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century . Tonight , as part of our gift to the millennium , I propose a 21st century research fund for path breaking scientific inquiry , the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health , the National Science Foundation , the National Cancer Institute . We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes . I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases . As important as all this scientific progress is , we must continue to see that science serves humanity , not the other way around . We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American . And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings . We should enable all the world s people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace . Think of this The first time I made a State of the Union speech to you , only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web literally , just a handful of people . Now , in schools , in libraries , homes , and businesses , millions and millions of Americans surf the Net every day . We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet , but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet . We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids . For one thing , I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet . It is getting kind of clogged , you know , and the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1 , 000 times faster than today . Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium , we are going to open new frontiers in outer space . Throughout all history , humankind has had only one place to call home , our planet , Earth . Beginning this year , 1998 , men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens , the international space station . With its vast expanses , scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential . And this October , a true American hero , a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five hour space flight that changed the world , will return to the heavens . Godspeed , John Glenn . John , you will carry with you America s hopes . And on your uniform , once again , you will carry America s flag , marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America s past and the daring of America s future . Nearly 200 years ago , a tattered flag , its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle , moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope , the words that became our national anthem . Today , that Star Spangled Banner , along with the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution , and the Bill of Rights , are on display just a short walk from here . They are America s treasures , and we must also save them for the ages . I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America an America that has continued to rise through every age , against every challenge , a people of great works and greater possibilities , who have always , always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation to widen the circle of opportunity , to deepen the meaning of our freedom , to form that more perfect Union . Let that be our gift to the 21st century . God bless you , and God bless the United States .<speech_sep>President , Speaker , Members of the House and the Senate , distinguished Americans here as visitors in this Chamber , as am It is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech . When Presidents speak to Congress and the Nation from this podium , typically they comment on the full range in challenges and opportunities that face the United States . But this is not an ordinary time , and for all the many tasks that require our attention , I believe tonight one calls on us to focus , to unite , and to act . And that is our economy . For more than anything else , our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive again . Let me begin by saying that it has been too long , at least three decades , since a President has come and challenged Americans to join him on a great national journey , not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow . Like individuals , nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves , how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live , and later , how they wish to be judged by history . Like every individual man and woman , nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them . We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit . And at this historic moment , as communism has fallen , as freedom is spreading around the world , as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes , Americans have called for change . And now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them . Our Nation needs a new direction . Tonight I present to you a comprehensive plan to set our Nation on that new course . I believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries a commitment to opportunity , to individual responsibility , to community , to work , to family , and to faith . We must now break the habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that we are all in this together . The conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well known two decades of low productivity , growth , and stagnant wages persistent unemployment and underemployment years of huge Government deficits and declining investment in our future exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of Americans legions of poor children education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough , global economy . For too long we have drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community . And our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups , by partisan bickering , and by the sheer complexity of our problems . I believe we can do better because we remain the greatest nation on Earth , the world s strongest economy , the world s only military superpower . If we have the vision , the will , and the heart to make the changes we must , we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and enter it having secured the American dream for ourselves and for future generations . I well remember 12 years ago President Reagan stood at this very podium and told you and the American people that if our national debt were stacked in thousand dollar bills , the stack would reach 67 miles into space . Well , today that stack would reach 267 miles . I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem . There is plenty of blame to go around in both branches of the Government and both parties . The time has come for the blame to end . I did not seek this office to place blame . I come here tonight to accept responsibility , and I want you to accept responsibility with me . And if we do right by this country , I do not care who gets the credit for it . The plan I offer you has four fundamental components . First , it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment , initially by jumpstarting the economy in the short term and investing in our people , their jobs , and their incomes over the long run . Second , it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision making . Third , it substantially reduces the Federal deficit honestly and credibly by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of Government revenues , not , as the executive branch has done so often in the past , using the most optimistic ones . And finally , it seeks to earn the trust of the American people by paying for these plans first with cuts in Government waste and efficiency second , with cuts , not gimmicks , in Government spending and by fairness , for a change , in the way additional burdens are borne . Tonight I want to talk with you about what Government can do because I believe Government must do more . But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector , and second , that each of us must be an engine of growth and change . The truth is that as Government creates more opportunity in this new and different time , we must also demand more responsibility in turn . Our immediate priority must be to create jobs , create jobs now . Some people say , Well , we are in a recovery , and we do not have to do that . Well , we all hope we are in a recovery , but we are sure not creating new jobs . And there is no recovery worth its salt that does not put the American people back to work . To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery , I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over 30 billion to put people to work now , to create a half a million jobs jobs to rebuild our highways and airports , to renovate housing , to bring new life to rural communities , and spread hope and opportunity among our Nation s youth . Especially I want to emphasize , after the events of last year in Los Angeles and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities , this proposal will create almost 700 , 000 new summer jobs for displaced , unemployed young people alone this summer . And tonight I invite America s business leaders to join us in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people . Second , our plan looks beyond today s business cycle because our aspirations extend into the next century . The heart of this plan deals with the long term . It is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future . And it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest , will lower interest rates , will decrease the percentage of the Federal budget claimed by interest payments , and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy . Over the long run , all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth , improved productivity , more high quality jobs , and an improved economic competitive position in the world . In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction , something no American Government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before , spending must be cut and taxes must be raised . The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact , to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes , and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment . The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most . Our plan is designed , furthermore , and perhaps in some ways most importantly , to improve the health of American business through lower interest rates , more incentives to invest , and better trained workers . Because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our Nation over the last 10 or 15 years , our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history . We propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country , with revenues of under 5 million . That is about 90 percent of the firms in America , employing about 40 percent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade . And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks . We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time . And we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper . With a new network of community development banks and 1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real , we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from south Boston to south Texas to south central Los Angeles . This plan invests in our roads , our bridges , our transit systems , in high speed railways and high tech information systems . And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with State and local government of our time , to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future . Standing as we are on the edge of a new century , we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade . And so , we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade , including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment . At the same time and I say this to you in both parties and across America tonight , all the people who are listening it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement . This world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive , targeted attempts to create the high wage jobs of the future . That is what all our competitors are doing . We must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century but that are in trouble in America today , like aerospace . We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations . And again I will say we must do this together . I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labor and Government work together for a change . But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail let me say this again I feel so strongly about this all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year , not next year , not 5 years from now but this year , bold steps to reform our health care system . In 1992 , we spent 14 percent of our income on health care , more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world , and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens . Unless we change the present pattern , 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs . By the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care . Our families will never be secure , our businesses will never be strong , and our Government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis . We must do it this year . The combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people . And they are weakening our economy every day . Reducing health care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in growth and jobs . Bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any spending program we could promote . Reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in America . Later this spring , after the First Lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work , I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families , so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either . We will have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor . We will have to maintain the highest American standards and the right to choose in a system that is the world s finest for all those who can access it . But first we must make choices . We must choose to give the American people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more Americans into agony . Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this . I realize this is a complicated issue . But we must address it . And I believe if there is any chance that Republicans and Democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or anything else could agree on one thing , surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth . We cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year . We can do better . And I will work to do better . Perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction I propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which I seek in our children . Each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost . Half of the 2 year olds in this country today do not receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases . Our plan will provide them for every eligible child . And we know now that we will save 10 later for every 1 we spend by eliminating preventable childhood diseases . That is a good investment no matter how you measure it . I recommend that the women , infants , and children s nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it . We all know that Head Start , a program that prepares children for school , is a success story . We all know that it saves money . But today it just reaches barely over one third of all the eligible children . Under this plan , every eligible child will be able to get a head start . This is not just the right thing to do it is the smart thing to do . For every dollar we invest today , we will save 3 tomorrow . We have to start thinking about tomorrow . I have heard that somewhere before . We have to ask more in our schools of our students , our teachers , our principals , our parents . Yes , we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards , but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning . Money alone is not enough . We have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools . We have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy . So we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education and the Government for apprenticeship programs in every State in this country to give our people the skills they need . Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers , too , throughout their career . The average 18 year old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime . We have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years , but the system is too fractured . We must develop a unified , simplified , sensible , streamlined worker training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them . We have got to do better on this . And finally , I propose a program that got a great response from the American people all across this country last year a program of national service to make college loans available to all Americans and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or community service workers to give them the option to pay the loans back , but at tax time so they cannot beat the bill , but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their knowledge . A generation ago when President Kennedy proposed and the United States Congress embraced the Peace Corps , it defined the character of a whole generation of Americans committed to serving people around the world . In this national service program , we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the Peace Corps . This program could do for this generation of Members of Congress what the land grant college act did and what the GI bill did for former Congressmen . In the future , historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving America a new lease on life , if you meet this challenge . If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning , we must believe in rewarding work . If we believe in restoring the values that make America special , we must believe that there is dignity in all work , and there must be dignity for all workers . To those who care for our sick , who tend our children , who do our most difficult and tiring jobs , the new direction I propose will make this solemn , simple commitment By expanding the refundable earned income tax credit , we will make history . We will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you have got a child in the house , you will no longer be in poverty . Later this year , we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it . I have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade . And I know from personal conversations with many people that no one , no one wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it . I want to offer the people on welfare the education , the training , the child care , the health care they need to get back on their feet , but say after 2 years they must get back to work , too , in private business if possible , in public service if necessary . We have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity . Our next great goal should be to strengthen our families . I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step , but it is time to do more . This plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement system it has ever had . It is time to demand that people take responsibility for the children they bring in this world . And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart . We must pass a tough crime bill . I support not only the bill which did not quite make it to the President s desk last year but also an initiative to put 100 , 000 more police officers on the street , to provide boot camps for first time nonviolent offenders for more space for the hardened criminals in jail . And I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals . Let me say this . I will make you this bargain If you will pass the Brady bill , I will sure sign it . Let me say now , we should move to the harder parts . I think it is clear to every American , including every Member of Congress of both parties , that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in Washington is not high . We must restore it . We must begin again to make Government work for ordinary taxpayers , not simply for organized interest groups . And that beginning must start with real political reform . I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year . I ask you to increase the participation of the American people by passing the motor voter bill promptly . I ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill . Believe me , they were cheering that last section at home . I believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for Republicans and Democrats alike because it says to the voters back home , This is your House . This is your Senate . We are your hired hands , and every penny we draw is your money . Next , to revolutionize Government we have to ensure that we live within our means , and that should start at the top and with the White House . In the last few days I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent , saving approximately 10 million . I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments . I have cut the Federal bureaucracy , or will over the next 4 years , by approximately 100 , 000 positions , for a combined savings of 9 billion . It is time for Government to demonstrate , in the condition we are in , that we can be as frugal as any household in America . And that is why I also want to congratulate the Congress . I noticed the announcement of the leadership today that Congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs . I think that is important . I think it will send a very clear signal to the American people . But if we really want to cut spending , we are going to have to do more , and some of it will be difficult . Tonight I call for an across the board freeze in Federal Government salaries for one year . And thereafter , during this 4 year period , I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost of living allowance normally involved in Federal pay increases . Next , I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts , as you know , and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been . Finally , let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle , it is not enough simply to cut Government we have to rethink the whole way it works . When I became President I was amazed at just the way the White House worked , in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay , outmoded ways that did not take maximum advantage of technology and did not do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers money . So I want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every Government Department . I want to push education reform , as I said , not just to spend more money but to really improve learning . Some things work , and some things do not . We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that do not . I had like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyers . In the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans , we must use Federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions , but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from making sensible loans . I had like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people , to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs . In the end we want people not to need us anymore . I think that is important . But in the end we have to get back to the deficit . For years there is been a lot of talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it . And now I understand why , having dealt with the real numbers for 4 weeks . But I believe this plan does it tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term . It puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in Federal priorities , from consumption to investment , in the history of this country at the same time over the next 4 years . Let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as I go around the country and who have asked it in the past We are not cutting the deficit just because experts say it is the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit . We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt , the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country . And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings , the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children , for a home mortgage , or to start a new business . That is why we have got to reduce the debt , because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in . We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a home , so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers , so that our Government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation . If we do not act now , you and I might not even recognize this Government 10 years from now . If we just stay with the same trends of the last 4 years , by the end of the decade the deficit will be 635 billion a year , almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product . And paying interest on that debt will be the costliest Government program of all . We will still be the world s largest debtor . And when Members of Congress come here , they will be devoting over 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments , more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements . And you will come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on the dollar , no matter what America s problems are . We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must . And we will be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment . This budget plan , by contrast , will by 1997 cut 140 billion in that year alone from the deficit , a real spending cut , a real revenue increase , a real deficit reduction , using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office . Well , you can laugh , my fellow Republicans , but I will point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous Presidents have been . I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers . I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty . I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we are likely to get if the recovery stays and we do right things economically , then it will turn out better for the American people than we say . In the last 12 years , because there were differences over the revenue estimates , you and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility . This is tightening the rein on the Democrats as well as the Republicans . Let us at least argue about the same set of numbers so the American people will think we are shooting straight with them . As I said earlier , my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to cut the Federal spending by a total of 246 billion . We are eliminating programs that are no longer needed , such as nuclear power research and development . We are slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects . But many of these programs were justified in their time , and a lot of them are difficult for me to recommend reductions in , some really tough ones for me personally . I recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the Rural Electric Administration . That is a difficult thing for me to recommend . But I think that I cannot exempt the things that exist in my State or in my experience , if I ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with . We are going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental abiding interest of the American people . I have to say that we all know our Government has been just great at building programs . The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them too that we can not only start things , that we can actually stop things . About the defense budget , I raise a hope and a caution . As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post cold war world , it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget . And we may all doubt what that range of reductions is , but let me say that as long as I am President , I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best trained , the best prepared , the best equipped fighting force in the world . And every one of you should make that solemn pledge . We still have responsibilities around the world . We are the world s only superpower . This is still a dangerous and uncertain time , and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs . Backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy , our Nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict , by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , by the global democratic revolution , and by challenges to the health of our global environment . I know this economic plan is ambitious , but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States . And I think it is paid for fairly , first by cutting Government , then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past , and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow . For the wealthiest , those earning more than 180 , 000 per year , I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for Federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent . We recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over 250 , 000 a year , and we recommend closing some loopholes that let some people get away without paying any tax at all . For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of 10 million , we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate , also to 36 percent , as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses . Our plan seeks to attack tax subsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America . I say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former Governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my State . But the Tax Code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else , and it does in particular cases today . We will seek to ensure that , through effective tax enforcement , foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make on the same income . To middle class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight , I will say again as I did on Monday night You are not going alone any more , you are certainly not going first , and you are not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past . I want to emphasize the facts about this plan 98 . 8 percent of America s families will have no increase in their income tax rates , only 1 . 2 percent at the top . Let me be clear There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare . As we move toward the 4th year , with the explosion in health care costs , as I said , projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000 , there must be planned cuts in payments to providers , to doctors , to hospitals , to labs , as a way of controlling health care costs . But I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system . If you will help me do that , we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care . Let me repeat this , because I know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle . This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in Medicare benefits for any beneficiary . Secondly , the only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized . The plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes , who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by , to contribute more . This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now . Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan . Our plan does include a broad based tax on energy , and I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it is a good idea . I recommend that we adopt a Btu tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit because it also combats pollution , promotes energy efficiency , promotes the independence , economically , of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt , and because it does not discriminate against any area . Unlike a carbon tax , that is not too hard on the coal States unlike a gas tax , that is not too tough on people who drive a long way to work unlike an ad valorem tax , it does not increase just when the price of an energy source goes up . And it is environmentally responsible . It will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit . Taken together , these measures will cost an American family with an income of about 40 , 000 a year less than 17 a month . It will cost American families with incomes under 30 , 000 nothing because of other programs we propose , principally those raising the earned income tax credit . Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit , if we do these things , we will see the continuation of what is happened just since the election . Just since the election , since the Secretary of the Treasury , the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , and others who have begun to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan , interest rates have continued to fall long term . That means that for the middle class who will pay something more each month , if they had any credit needs or demands , their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages , consumer loans , credit cards . This can be a wise investment for them and their country now . I would also point out what the American people already know , and that is , because we are a big , vast country where we drive long distances , we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country . We will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country . And these will be spread fairly , with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under 30 , 000 and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in . Now , I ask all of you to consider this Whatever you think of the tax program , whatever you think of the spending cuts , consider the cost of not changing . Remember the numbers that you all know . If we just keep on doing what we are doing , by the end of the decade we will have a 650 billion a year deficit . If we just keep on doing what we are doing , by the end of the decade 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year , twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe . If we just keep on doing what we are doing , over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt . Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it , we are condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by occasional recessions , to slow growth in jobs , to no more growth in income , to more debt , to more disappointment . Worse , unless we change , unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes , we will be condemning our children and our children s children to a lesser life than we enjoyed . Once Americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years . At present productivity rates , it will take 100 years to double living standards , until our grandchildren s grandchildren are born . I say that is too long to wait . Tonight the American people know we have to change . But they are also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way . They know that as soon as I leave this Chamber and you go home , various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan , and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just cannot do it . Our people will be watching and wondering , not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to be business as usual or a real new day , whether we are all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we are working for them . We must scale the walls of the people s scepticisms , not with our words but with our deeds . After so many years of gridlock and indecision , after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results , the American people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment . This economic plan cannot please everybody . If the package is picked apart , there will be something that will anger each of us , will not please anybody . But if it is taken as a whole , it will help all of us . So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you do not like or some particular investment that was not made . And nobody likes the tax increases , but let us just face facts . For 20 years , through administrations of both parties , incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should . We cannot deny the reality of our condition . We have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can . My fellow Americans , the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me . It has got to be what is in it for us . If we work hard and if we work together , if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs , to rewarding work , to strengthening our families , to reinventing our Government , we can lift our country s fortunes again . Tonight I ask everyone in this Chamber and every American to look simply into your heart , to spark your own hopes , to fire your own imagination . There is so much good , so much possibility , so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly , as leaders should , our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress . This must be America s new direction . Let us summon the courage to seize it . Thank you . God bless America .<speech_sep>
