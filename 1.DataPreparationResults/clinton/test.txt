Thank you very much . Speaker , President , members of the 103rd Congress , my fellow Americans I am not at all sure what speech is in the TelePrompter tonight but I hope we can talk about the state of the Union . I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this chamber with such force and grace . Tip O Neill liked to call himself a man of the House . And he surely was that . But even more , he was a man of the people , a bricklayer s son who helped to build the great American middle class . Tip O Neill never forgot who he was , where he came from , or who sent him here . Tonight he is smiling down on us for the first time from the Lord s gallery . But in his honor , may we , too , always remember who we are , where we come from , and who sent us here . If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity , quality education , and a fair shot at the American dream , they will do extraordinary things . We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested . Our American heritage has always been to master such change , to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad . But for too long and in too many ways , that heritage was abandoned , and our country drifted . For 30 years , family life in America has been breaking down . For 20 years , the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining . For the 12 years of trickle down economics , we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled . From 1989 to 1992 , we experienced the slowest growth in a half century . For too many families , even when both parents were working , the American dream has been slipping away . In 1992 , the American people demanded that we change . A year ago I asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country . Well , we did . We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform . And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people , who broke gridlock , who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President and a Congress in 30 years . This Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars , cut spending , and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest Americans . This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low income workers to reward work over welfare . It produced NAFTIt produced the Brady bill , now the Brady law . And thank you , Jim Brady , for being here , and God bless you , sir . This Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs . It produced more research and treatment for AIDmore childhood immunizations , more support for women s health research , more affordable college loans for the middle class , a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education , a dramatic increase in high tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high tech economy . This Congress produced a new law , the motor voter bill , to help millions of people register to vote . It produced family and medical leave . All passed . All signed into law with not one single veto . These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office . And in fairness , they all had to be passed by you in this Congress . But I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here , who pay our salaries , who hold our feet to the fre . But what we do here is really beginning to change lives . Let me just give you one example . I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father I met early one Sunday morning in the White House . It was unusual to see a family there touring early Sunday morning , but he had his wife and his three children there , one of them in a wheelchair . I came up , and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit , I was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said , President , let me tell you something . My little girl here is desperately ill . She is probably not going to make it . But because of the family leave law , I was able to take time off to spend with her , the most important time I ever spent in my life , without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family . It means more to me than I will ever be able to say . Do not you people up here ever think what you do does not make a difference . It does . Though we are making a difference , our work has just begun . Many Americans still have not felt the impact of what we have done . The recovery still has not touched every community or created enough jobs . Incomes are still stagnant . There is still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places . Abroad , the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership . And so tonight , let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal , to create more and better jobs , to guarantee health security for all , to reward work over welfare , to promote democracy abroad , and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs , to renew our own American community . Last year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy . We cut 255 billion in spending , including entitlements , and over 340 separate budget items . We froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers . Led by the Vice President , we launched a campaign to reinvent government . We cut staff , cut perks , even trimmed the fleet of federal limousines . After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose action expanded it , we will actually reduce it by 252 , 000 people over the next five years . By the time we have finished , the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years . Because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980s , we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the deficit . So on April 15 , the American people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes . Only the top 1 yes , listen , the top 1 . 2 percent of Americans , as I said all along , will pay higher income tax rates . Let me repeat Only the wealthiest 1 . 2 percent of Americans will face higher income tax rates , and no one else will . And that is the truth . Of course , there were , as there always are in politics , naysayers who said this plan would not work . But they were wrong . When I became President , the experts predicted that next year s deficit would be 300 billion . But because we acted , those same people now say the deficit is going to be under 180 billion , 40 percent lower than was previously predicted . Our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years . And because those interest rates are down , business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the rate of the previous four years . Auto sales are way up . Home sales are at a record high . Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes , and our economy has produced 1 . 6 million private sector jobs in 1993 , more than were created in the previous four years combined . The people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early results . Proud . But everyone in this Chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do . Next month I will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to Congress . It will cut spending in more than 300 programs , eliminate 100 domestic programs , and reform the ways in which governments buy goods and services . This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set . We must do it . We have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery , without punishing seniors or the middle class , and without putting our national security at risk . If you will stick with this plan , we will post three consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White House . And once again , the buck stops here . Our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world . Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge , the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers . In one year , with NAFTwith GATwith our efforts in Asia and the National Export Strategy , we did more to open world markets to American products than at any time in the last two generations . That means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people , low deficits , low inflation , low interest rates , low trade barriers , and high investments . These are the building blocks of our recovery . But if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy , you all know we must do more . As we reduce defense spending , I ask Congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow . Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home . As we protect our environment , we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs . This year we will fight for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a reformed Superfund program . And the Vice President is right , we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom , every clinic , every library , every hospital in America into a national information super highway by the year 2000 . Think of it , instant access to information will increase productivity , will help to educate our children . It will provide better medical care . It will create jobs . And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year . As we expand opportunity and create jobs , no one can be left out . We must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws , because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty . But we all know , too , we can do all these things , put our economic house in order , expand world trade , target the jobs of the future , guarantee equal opportunity , but if we are honest , we will all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education , training , and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow . We must set tough , world class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them . Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice , to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard Are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy Goals 2000 links world class standards to grassroots reforms . And I hope Congress will pass it without delay . Our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work , providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school . After all , most of the people we are counting on to build our economic future will not graduate from college . It is time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them . We must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system . The old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back . We have got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs , because most of those old jobs just do not come back . And we know that the only way to have real job security in the future , to get a good job with a growing income , is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones . So we have got to streamline today s patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skills for our people who lose their jobs . Reemployment , not unemployment , must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal . I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress . And just as we must transform our unemployment system , so must we also revolutionize our welfare system . It does not work . It defies our values as a nation . If we value work , we cannot justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care . If we value responsibility , we cannot ignore the 34 billion in child support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children . If we value strong families , we cannot perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together . Can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent That is not just bad policy , it is wrong . And we ought to change it . I worked on this problem for years before I became President , with other Governors and with members of Congress of both parties and with the previous administration of another party . I worked on it with people who were on welfare , lots of them . And I want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue . The people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it . They want to get off welfare . They want to go back to work . They want to do right by their kids . I once had a hearing when I was a Governor , and I brought in people on welfare from all over America who had found their way to work . The woman from my state who testified was asked this question What is the best thing about being off welfare and in a job And without blinking an eye , she looked at 40 Governors , and she said , When my boy goes to school and they say what does you mother do for a living , he can give an answer . These people want a better system , and we ought to give it to them . Last year we began this . We gave the states more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington , and many states are already using it . Then this Congress took a dramatic step . Instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty , we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned income tax credit . It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty , rewarding work over welfare , making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents . Now that is real welfare reform . But there is more to be done . This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility . We will say to teenagers , If you have a child out of wedlock , we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household . We want families to stay together say to absent parents who are not paying their child support , If you are not providing for your children , we will garnish your wages , suspend your license , track you across state lines , and if necessary , make some of you work off what you owe . People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them . But to all those who depend on welfare , we should offer ultimately a simple compact . We will provide the support , the job training , the child care you need for up to two years . But after that , anyone who can work , must , in the private sector wherever possible , in community service , if necessary . That is the only way we will ever make elfare what it ought to be , a second chance , not a way of life . I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care . But let me point out , I think it is inevitable and imperative . It is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because it is the only way they can get health care coverage for their children . Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits , and many entry level jobs do not have health benefits , find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare . No wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage . We have got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform . So this year , we will make history by reforming the health care system . And I would say to you , all of you , my fellow public servants , this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians . That may not be popular with either party , but it happens to be the truth . You know , the First Lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across America and from all walks of life . I had like to share just one of them with you . Richard Anderson of Reno , Nevada , lost his job and with it , his health insurance . Two weeks later his wife , Judy , suffered a cerebral aneurysm . He rushed her to the hospital , where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days . The Andersons bills were over 120 , 000 . Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at 8 an hour , the bills were too much for them , and they were literally forced into bankruptcy . Clinton , he wrote to Hillary , no one in the United States of America should have to lose everything they have worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill . It was to help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the First Lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue . We owe them our thanks and our action . I know there are people here who say there is no health care crisis . Tell it to Richard and Judy Anderson . Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year . Tell it to the 81 million Americans with those preexisting conditions . Those folks are paying more , or they cannot get insurance at all . Or they cannot ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions . Tell it to the small businesses burdened by the skyrocketing cost of insurance . Most small businesses cover their employees , and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or government . Or tell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans , three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits . And that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most . So if any of you believe there is no crisis , you tell it to those people , because I cannot . There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people s lives . And all you have to do is go out and listen to them . Just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country . They are Republicans and Democrats and independents it does not have a lick to do with party . They think we do not get it . And it is time we show them that we do get it . From the day we began , our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care system the world s best health care professionals , cutting edge research and wonderful research institutions , Medicare for older Americans . None of this , none of it should be put at risk . But we are paying more and more money for less and less care . Every year fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their doctors . Every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become . This system is riddled with inefficiency , with abuse , with fraud , and everybody knows it . In today s health care system , insurance companies call the shots . They pick whom they cover and how they cover them . They can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most . They are in charge . What does it mean It means every night millions of well insured Americans go to bed just an illness , an accident , or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin . It means every morning millions of Americans go to work without any health insurance at all , something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do . It means that every year , more and more hard working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan . And countless others turn down better jobs because they know if they take the better job , they will lose their health insurance . If we just let the health care system continue to drift , our country will have people with less care , fewer choices , and higher bills . Now , our approach protects the quality of care and people s choices . It builds on what works today in the private sector , to expand employer based coverage , to guarantee private insurance for every American . And I might say , employer based private insurance for every American was proposed 20 years ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress . It was a good idea then , and it is a better idea today . Why do we want guaranteed private insurance Because right now nine out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employers . And that should continue . And if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices , that should continue , too . That ought to make the Congress and the President feel better . Our goal is health insurance everybody can depend on comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs health premiums that do not just explode when you get sick or you get older the power , no matter how small your business is , to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates governments and big business get today one simple form for people who are sick and most of all , the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor . Our approach protects older Americans . Every plan before the Congress proposes to slow the growth of Medicare . The difference is this We believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens . Medicare must be protected , and it should cover prescription drugs , and we should take the first steps in covering long term care . To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors , I say the solution to today s squeeze on middle class working people s health care is not to put the squeeze on middle class retired people s health care . We can do better than that . When it is all said and done , it is pretty simple to me . Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean You pay a fair price for security , and when you get sick , health care s always there , no matter what . Along with the guarantee of health security , we all have to admit , too , there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system . People have to take their kids to get immunized . We should all take advantage of preventive care . We must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms . We have to practice better health habits , and we cannot abuse the system . And those who do not have insurance under our approach will get coverage , but they will have to pay something for it , too . The minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others , should contribute something . People who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes . Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis . There cannot be any more something for nothing . It will not be easy but it can be done . Now , in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security . But if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care . President Roosevelt tried . President Truman tried . President Nixon tried . President Carter tried . Every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them . But not this time . I know that facing up to these interests will require courage . It will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence . The work of change , frankly , will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well financed interests who profit from this current system . So I also must now call on you to finish the job both Houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year . You know , my fellow Americans , this is really a test for all of us . The American people provide those of us in government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs . We have health care that is always there . I think we need to give every hard working , tax paying American the same health care security they have already given to us . I want to make this very clear . I am open , as I have said repeatedly , to the best ideas of concerned members of both parties . I have no special brief for any specific approach , even in our own bill , except this If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away , you will force me to take this pen , veto the legislation , and we will come right back here and start all over again . But I do not think that is going to happen . I think we are ready to act now . I believe that you are ready to act now . And if you are ready to guarantee every American the same health care that you have , health care that can never be taken away , now , not next year or the year after , now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here . Now . As we take these steps together to renew our strength at home , we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad . This is a promising moment . Because of the agreements we have reached this year , last year , Russia s strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the United States , nor will we point ours at them . Instead of building weapons in space , Russian scientists will help us to build the international space station . Of course , there are still dangers in the world rampant arms proliferation , bitter regional conflicts , ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies , severe environmental degradation the world over , and fanatics who seek to cripple the world s cities with terror . As the world s greatest power , we must , therefore , maintain our defenses and our responsibilities . This year , we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them . We worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth . We achieved agreements with Ukraine , with Belarus , with Kazahkstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal . We are working to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons . We will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide . And earlier today , we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing . But nothing , nothing is more important to our security than our nation s armed forces . We honor their contributions , including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in Bosnia , those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there . Our forces are the finest military our nation has ever had . And I have pledged that as long as I am President , they will remain the best equipped , the best trained , and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the Earth . Last year I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post cold war security at a lower cost . This year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other government programs . I said , no . The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts . It protects the readiness and quality of our forces . Ultimately , the best strategy is to do that . We must not cut defense further . I hope the Congress , without regard to party , will support that position . Ultimately , the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere . Democracies do not attack each other , they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy . That is why we have supported , you and the democratic reformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet bloc . I applaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our initiatives to help Russia , Ukraine , and the other states through their epic transformations . Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values . We will continue to urge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms . And we will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems , while insisting that if Russian troops operate in neighboring states , they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards . But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures and they must chart their own futures how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reforms succeed all across the former Communist bloc . Our policy has been to support that move , and that has been the policy of the Congress . We should continue it . That is why I went to Europe earlier this month , to work with our European partners , to help to integrate all the former Communist countries into a Europe that has a possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history , its entire history , based on the simple commitments of all nations in Europe to democracy , to free markets , and to respect for existing borders . With our allies we have created a Partnership For Peace that invites states from the former Soviet bloc and other non NATO members to work with NATO in military cooperation . When I met with Central Europe s leaders , including Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel , men who put their lives on the line for freedom , I told them that the security of their region is important to our country s security . This year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world . We will ask Congress to ratify the new GATT accord . We will continue standing by South Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy . We will convene a summit of the western hemisphere s democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America . And we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in Haiti . And as we build a more constructive relationship with China , we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation s human rights record . We will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace . Last year the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the White House when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation . But there is a long , hard road ahead . And on that road I am determined that I and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region . Now , there are some in our country who argue that with the Cold War , America should turn its back on the rest of the world . Many around the world were afraid we would do just that . But I took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge , to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world . And this year , because of our work together , enacting NAFTkeeping our military strong and prepared , supporting democracy abroad , we have reaffirmed America s leadership , America s engagement . And as a result , the American people are more secure than they were before . But while Americans are more secure from threats abroad , I think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home . Every day the national peace is shattered by crime . In Petaluma , California , an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas . An ordinary train ride on Long Island ends in a hail of 9 millimeter rounds . A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black . Right here in our nation s Capital , a brave young man named Jason White , a policeman , the son and grandson of policemen , is ruthlessly gunned down . Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society , limiting personal freedom , and fraying the ties that bind us . The crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it , a chance to be tough and smart . What does that mean Let me begin by saying I care a lot about this issue . Many years ago , when I started out in public life , I was the attorney general of my state . I served as a Governor for a dozen years . I know what it is like to sign laws increasing penalties , to build more prison cells , to carry out the death penalty . I understand this issue . And it is not a simple thing . First , we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole . Now those who commit crimes should be punished . And those who commit repeated , violent crimes should be told , When you commit a third violent crime , you will be put away , and put away for good . Three strikes , and you are out . Second , we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime , beginning with more police officers and more community policing . We know right now that police who work the streets , know the folks , have the respect of the neighborhood kids , focus on high crime areas , we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals . Look at the experience of Houston , where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken . Here tonight is one of those community policemen , a brave , young detective , Kevin Jett , whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York . Every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connections to the people whose lives he protects . I had like to ask him to stand up and be recognized tonight . Thank you , sir . You will be given a chance to give the children of this country , the law abiding working people of this country and do not forget , in the toughest neighborhoods in this country , in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country , the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law , pay their taxes , do their best to raise their kids . They deserve people like Kevin Jett . And you are going to be given a chance to give the American people another 100 , 000 of them , well trained . And I urge you to do it . You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces , an inordinate resource for our country one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets . These are important things . The third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady bill , the Brady law , to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals . I want to say something about this issue . Hunters must always be free to hunt . Law abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes . I respect that part of our culture I grew up in it . But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence . I say to you , I know you did not create this problem , but we need your help to solve it . There is no sporting purpose on Earth that should stop the United States Congress from banishing assault weapons that out gun police and cut down children . Fourth , we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes . Recent studies indicate , sadly , that drug use is on the rise again among our young people . The crime bill contains all the crime bills contain more money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs . Our administration s budget , with all its cuts , contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education . You must pass them both . We need them desperately . My fellow Americans , the problem of violence is an American problem . It has no partisan or philosophical element . Therefore , I urge you to find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong , smart , tough crime bill . But further , I urge you to consider this As you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence , let us also remember how we came to this sad point . In our toughest neighborhoods , on our meanest streets , in our poorest rural areas , we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community , family , and work , the heart and soul of civilized society . This has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs . So I ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime , we must give people , especially our young people , something to say yes to . Many of our initiatives , from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service , will help to rebuild distressed communities , to strengthen families , to provide work . But more needs to be done . That is what our community empowerment agenda is all about , challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones , ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from , passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs , opportunity , and hope where they are needed most . I think you know that to really solve this problem , we will all have to put our heads together , leave our ideological armor aside , and find some new ideas to do even more . And let us be honest , we all know something else too Our problems go way beyond the reach of government . They are rooted in the loss of values , in the disappearance of work , and the breakdown of our families and our communities . My fellow Americans , we can cut the deficit , create jobs , promote democracy around the world , pass welfare reform and health care , pass the toughest crime bill in history , but still leave too many of our people behind . The American people have got to want to change from within if we are going to bring back work and family and community . We cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage . We cannot renew this country when 13 year old boys get semi automatic weapons to shoot 9 year olds for kicks . We cannot renew our country when children are having children , and the fathers walk away as if the kids do not amount to anything . We cannot renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it . We cannot renew our country unless more of us I mean , all of us are willing to join the churches and the other good citizens , people like all the ministers I have worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns I met at Our Lady of Help in east Los Angeles or my good friend Tony Campollo in Philadelphia , unless we are willing to work with people like that , people who are saving kids , adopting schools , making streets safer . All of us can do that . We cannot renew our country until we realize that governments do not raise children , parents do . Parents who know their children s teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong , those kinds of parents can make all the difference . I know , I had one . I am telling you , we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them . Our country needs it , we need it , and they deserve it . So I say to you tonight , let us give our children a future . Let us take away their guns and give them books . Let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope . Let us , by our example , teach them to obey the law , respect our neighbors , and cherish our values . Let us weave these sturdy threads into a new American community that can once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow . Oh , there will be naysayers who fear that we will not be equal to the challenges of this time . But they misread our history , our heritage . Even today s headlines , all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge . When the Earth shook and fires raged in California , when I saw the Mississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500 year flood , when the century s bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News , it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams . But the American people , they just came together . They rose to the occasion , neighbor helping neighbor , strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers , showing the better angels of our nature . Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters , leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting . Let us instead be true to our spirit , facing facts , coming together , bringing hope , and moving forward . Tonight , my fellow Americans , we are summoned to answer a question as old as the Republic itself What is the state of our Union It is growing stronger , but it must be stronger still . With your help , and God s help , it will be . Thank you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans Today I want to talk with you about our Nation s military involvement in Somalia . A year ago , we all watched with horror as Somali children and their families lay dying by the tens of thousands , dying the slow , agonizing death of starvation , a starvation brought on not only by drought , but also by the anarchy that then prevailed in that country . This past weekend we all reacted with anger and horror as an armed Somali gang desecrated the bodies of our American soldiers and displayed a captured American pilot , all of them soldiers who were taking part in an international effort to end the starvation of the Somali people themselves . These tragic events raise hard questions about our effort in Somalia . Why are we still there What are we trying to accomplish How did a humanitarian mission turn violent And when will our people come home These questions deserve straight answers . Let us start by remembering why our troops went into Somalia in the first place . We went because only the United States could help stop one of the great human tragedies of this time . A third of a million people had died of starvation and disease . Twice that many more were at risk of dying . Meanwhile , tons of relief supplies piled up in the capital of Mogadishu because a small number of Somalis stopped food from reaching their own countrymen . Our conscience said , enough . In our Nation s best tradition , we took action with bipartisan support . President . Bush sent in 28 , 000 American troops as part of a United Nations humanitarian mission . Our troops created a secure environment so that food and medicine could get through . We . saved close to one million lives . And throughout most of Somalia , everywhere but in Mogadishu , life began returning to normal . Crops are growing . Markets are reopening . So are schools and hospitals . Nearly a million Somalis still depend completely on relief supplies , but at least the starvation is gone . And none of this would have happened without American leadership and America s troops . Until June , things went well , with little violence . The United States reduced our troop presence from 28 , 000 down to less than 5 , 000 , with other nations picking up where we left off . But then in June , the people who caused much of the problem in the beginning started attacking American , Pakistani , and other troops who were there just to keep the peace . Rather than participate in building the peace with others , these people sought to fight and to disrupt , even if it means returning Somalia to anarchy and mass famine . And make no mistake about it , if we were to leave Somalia tomorrow , other nations would leave , too . Chaos would resume . The relief effort would stop , and starvation soon would return . That knowledge has led us to continue our mission . It is not our job to rebuild Somalia s society or even to create a political process that can allow Somalia s clans to live and work in peace . The Somalis must do that for themselves . The United Nations and many African states are more than willing to help . But we , we in the United States must decide whether we will give them enough time to have a reasonable chance to succeed . We started this mission for the right reasons , and we are going to finish it in the right way . In a sense , we came to Somalia to rescue innocent people in a burning house . We have nearly put the fire out , but some smoldering embers remain . If we leave them now , those embers will reignite into flames , and people will die again . If we stay a short while longer and do the right things , we have got a reasonable chance of cooling off the embers and getting other firefighters to take our place . We also have to recognize that we cannot leave now and still have all our troops present and accounted for . And I want you to know that I am determined to work for the security of those Americans missing or held captive . Anyone holding an American fight now should understand , above all else , that we will hold them strictly responsible for our soldiers well being . We expected them to be well treated , and we expect them to be released . So now we face a choice . Do we leave when the job gets tough , or when the job is well done Do we invite a return of mass suffering , or do we leave in a way that gives the Somalis a decent chance to survive Recently , General Colin Powell said this about our choices in Somalia Because things get difficult , you do not cut and rim . You work the problem and try to find a correct solution . I want to bring our troops home from Somalia . Before the events of this week , as I said , we had already reduced the number of our troops there from 28 , 000 to less than 5 , 000 . We must complete that withdrawal soon , and I will . But we must also leave on our terms . We must do it right . And here is what I intend to do . This past week s events make it clear that even as we prepare to withdraw from Somalia , we need more strength there . We need more armor , more air power , to ensure that our people are safe and that we can do our job . Today I have ordered 1 , 700 additional Army troops and 104 additional armored vehicles to Somalia to protect our troops and to complete our mission . I have also ordered an aircraft carrier and two amphibious groups with 3 , 600 combat Marines to be stationed offshore . These forces will be under American command . Their mission , what I am asking these young Americans to do , is the following First , they are there to protect our troops and our bases . We did not go to Somalia with a military purpose . We never wanted to kill anyone . But those who attack our soldiers must know they will pay a very heavy price . Second , they are there to keep open and secure the roads , the port , and the lines of communication that are essential for the United Nations and the relief workers to keep the flow of food and supplies and people moving freely throughout the country so that starvation and anarchy do not return . Third , they are there to keep the pressure on those who cut off relief supplies and attacked our people , not to personalize the conflict but to prevent a return to anarchy . Fourth , through their pressure and their presence , our troops will help to make it possible for the Somali people , working with others , to reach agreements among themselves so that they can solve their problems and survive when we leave . That is our mission . I am proposing this plan because it will let us finish leaving Somalia on our own terms and without destroying all that two administrations have accomplished there . For , if we were to leave today , we know what would happen . Within months , Somali children again would be dying in the streets . Our own credibility with friends and allies would be severely damaged . Our leadership in world affairs would be undermined at the very time when people are looking to America to help promote peace and freedom in the post cold war world . And all around the world , aggressors , thugs , and terrorists will conclude that the best way to get us to change our policies is to kill our people . It would be open season on Americans . That is why I am committed to getting this job done in Somalia , not only quickly but also effectively . To do that , I am taking steps to ensure troops from other nations are ready to take the place of our own soldiers . We have already withdrawn some 20 , 000 troops , and more than that number have replaced them from over two dozen other nations . Now we will intensify efforts to have other countries deploy more troops to Somalia to assure that security will remain when we are gone . And we will complete the replacement of military logistics personnel with civilian contractors who can provide the same support to the United Nations . While we are taking military steps to protect our own people and to help the maintain a secure environment , we must pursue new diplomatic efforts to help the Somalis find a political solution to their problems . That is the only kind of outcome that can endure . For fundamentally , the solution to Somalia s problems is not a military one , it is political . Leaders of the neighboring African states , such as Ethiopia and Eritrea , have offered to take the lead in efforts to build a settlement among the Somali people that can preserve order and security . I have directed my representatives to pursue such efforts vigorously . And I have asked Ambassador Bob Oakley , who served effectively in two administrations as our representative in Somalia , to travel again to the region immediately to advance this process . Obviously , even then there is no guarantee that Somalia will rid itself of violence and suffering . But at least we will have given Somalia a reasonable chance . This week some 15 , 000 Somalis took to the streets to express sympathy for our losses , to thank us for our effort . Most Somalis are not hostile to us but grateful . And they want to use this opportunity to rebuild their country . It is my judgment and that of my military advisers that we may need up to 6 months to complete these steps and to conduct an orderly withdrawal . We will do what we can to complete the mission before then . All American troops will be out of Somalia no later than March the 31st , except for a few hundred support personnel in noncombat roles . If we take these steps , if we take the time to do the job right , I am convinced we will have lived up to the responsibilities of American leadership in the word . And we will have proved that we are committed to addressing the new problems of a new era . When out troops in Somalia came under fire this last weekend , we witnessed a dramatic example of the heroic ethic of our American military . When the first Black Hawk helicopter was downed this weekend , the other American troops did not retreat although they could have . Some 90 of them formed a perimeter around the helicopter , and they held that ground under intensely heavy fire . They stayed with their comrades . That is the kind of soldiers they are . That is the kind of people we are . So let us finish the work we set out to do . Let us demonstrate to the world , as generations of Americans have done before us , that when Americans take on a challenge , they do the job right . Let me express my thanks and my gratitude and my profound sympathy to the families of the young Americans who were killed in Somalia . My message to you is , your country is grateful , and so is the rest of the word , and so are the vast majority of the Somali people . Our mission from this day forward is to increase our strength , do our job , bring our soldiers out , and bring them home . Thank you , and God bless America .<speech_sep>Good evening . Last week , the warring factions in Bosnia reached a peace agreement , as a result of our efforts in Dayton , Ohio , and the support of our European and Russian partners . Tonight , I want to speak with you about implementing the Bosnian peace agreement , and why our values and interests as Americans require that we participate . Let me say at the outset , America s role will not be about fighting a war . It will be about helping the people of Bosnia to secure their own peace agreement . Our mission will be limited , focused , and under the command of an American general . In fulfilling this mission , we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilians , especially children , and at the same time , to bring stability to Central Europe , a region of the world that is vital to our national interests . It is the right thing to do . From our birth , America has always been more than just a place . America has embodied an idea that has become the ideal for billions of people throughout the world . Our Founders said it best America is about life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . In this century especially , America has done more than simply stand for these ideals . We have acted on them and sacrificed for them . Our people fought two World Wars so that freedom could triumph over tyranny . After World War we pulled back from the world , leaving a vacuum that was filled by the forces of hatred . After World War Iwe continued to lead the world . We made the commitments that kept the peace , that helped to spread democracy , that created unparalleled prosperity , and that brought victory in the cold war . Today , because of our dedication , America s ideals liberty , democracy , and peace are more and more the aspirations of people everywhere in the world . It is the power of our ideas , even more than our size , our wealth , and our military might , that makes America a uniquely trusted nation . With the cold war over , some people now question the need for our continued active leadership in the world . They believe that , much like after World War America can now step back from the responsibilities of leadership . They argue that to be secure we need only to keep our own borders safe and that the time has come now to leave to others the hard work of leadership beyond our borders . I strongly disagree . As the cold war gives way to the global village , our leadership is needed more than ever because problems that start beyond our borders can quickly become problems within them . We are all vulnerable to the organized forces of intolerance and destruction terrorism ethnic , religious and regional rivalries the spread of organized crime and weapons of mass destruction and drug trafficking . Just as surely as fascism and communism , these forces also threaten freedom and democracy , peace and prosperity . And they , too , demand American leadership . But nowhere has the argument for our leadership been more clearly justified than in the struggle to stop or prevent war and civil violence . From Iraq to Haiti , from South Africa to Korea , from the Middle East to Northern Ireland , we have stood up for peace and freedom because it is in our interest to do so and because it is the right thing to do . Now , that does not mean we can solve every problem . My duty as President is to match the demands for American leadership to our strategic interest and to our ability to make a difference . America cannot and must not be the world s policeman . We cannot stop all war for all time , but we can stop some wars . We cannot save all women and all children , but we can save many of them . We cannot do everything , but we must do what we can . There are times and places where our leadership can mean the difference between peace and war , and where we can defend our fundamental values as a people and serve our most basic , strategic interests . My fellow Americans , in this new era there are still times when America and America alone can and should make the difference for peace . The terrible war in Bosnia is such a case . Nowhere today is the need for American leadership more stark or more immediate than in Bosnia . For nearly 4 years a terrible war has torn Bosnia apart . Horrors we prayed had been banished from Europe forever have been seared into our minds again skeletal prisoners caged behind barbed wire fences women and girls raped as a tool of war defenseless men and boys shot down into mass graves , evoking visions of World War II concentration camps and endless lines of refugees marching toward a future of despair . When I took office , some were urging immediate intervention in the conflict . I decided that American ground troops should not fight a war in Bosnia because the United States could not force peace on Bosnia s warring ethnic groups , the Serbs , Croats , and Muslims . Instead , America has worked with our European allies in searching for peace , stopping the war from spreading , and easing the suffering of the Bosnian people . We imposed tough economic sanctions on Serbia . We used our air power to conduct the longest humanitarian airlift in history and to enforce a no fly zone that took the war out of the skies . We helped to make peace between two of the three warring parties , the Muslims and the Croats . But as the months of war turned into years , it became clear that Europe alone could not end the conflict . This summer , Bosnian Serb shelling once again turned Bosnia s playgrounds and marketplaces into killing fields . In response , the United States led NATO s heavy and continuous air strikes , many of them flown by skilled and brave American pilots . Those air strikes , together with the renewed determination of our European partners and the Bosnian and Croat gains on the battlefield convinced the Serbs , finally , to start thinking about making peace . At the same time , the United States initiated an intensive diplomatic effort that forged a Bosnia wide cease fire and got the parties to agree to the basic principles of peace . Three dedicated American diplomats , Bob Frasure , Joe Kruzel , and Nelson Drew , lost their lives in that effort . Tonight we remember their sacrifice and that of their families . And we will never forget their exceptional service to our Nation . Finally , just 3 weeks ago , the Muslims , Croats , and Serbs came to Dayton , Ohio , in America s heartland , to negotiate a settlement . There , exhausted by war , they made a commitment to peace . They agreed to put down their guns , to preserve Bosnia as a single state , to investigate and prosecute war criminals , to protect the human rights of all citizens , to try to build a peaceful , democratic future . And they asked for America s help as they implement this peace agreement . America has a responsibility to answer that request , to help to turn this moment of hope into an enduring reality . To do that , troops from our country and around the world would go into Bosnia to give them the confidence and support they need to implement their peace plan . I refuse to send American troops to fight a war in Bosnia , but I believe we must help to secure the Bosnian peace . I want you to know tonight what is at stake , exactly what our troops will be asked to accomplish , and why we must carry out our responsibility to help implement the peace agreement . Implementing the agreement in Bosnia can end the terrible suffering of the people , the warfare , the mass executions , the ethnic cleansing , the campaigns of rape and terror . Let us never forget a quarter of a million men , women , and children have been shelled , shot , and tortured to death . Two million people , half of the population , were forced from their homes and into a miserable life as refugees . And these faceless numbers hide millions of real personal tragedies . For each of the war s victims was a mother or daughter , a father or son , a brother or sister . Now the war is over . American leadership created the chance to build a peace and stop the suffering . Securing peace in Bosnia will also help to build a free and stable Europe . Bosnia lies at the very heart of Europe , next door to many of its fragile new democracies and some of our closest allies . Generations of Americans have understood that Europe s freedom and Europe s stability is vital to our own national security . That is why we fought two wars in Europe . That is why we launched the Marshall Plan to restore Europe . That is why we created NATO and waged the cold war . And that is why we must help the nations of Europe to end their worst nightmare since World War Inow . The only force capable of getting this job done is NATthe powerful , military alliance of democracies that has guaranteed our security for half a century now . And as NATO s leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement , the United States must be an essential part of the mission . If we are not there , NATO will not be there the peace will collapse the war will reignite the slaughter of innocents will begin again . A conflict that already has claimed so many victims could spread like poison throughout the region , eat away at Europe s stability , and erode our partnership with our European allies . And America s commitment to leadership will be questioned if we refuse to participate in implementing a peace agreement we brokered right here in the United States , especially since the Presidents of Bosnia , Croatia , and Serbia all asked us to participate and all pledged their best efforts to the security of our troops . When America s partnerships are weak and our leadership is in doubt , it undermines our ability to secure our interests and to convince others to work with us . If we do maintain our partnerships and our leadership , we need not act alone . As we saw in the Gulf war and in Haiti , many other nations who share our goals will also share our burdens . But when America does not lead , the consequences can be very grave , not only for others but eventually for us as well . As I speak to you , NATO is completing its planning for IFOan international force for peace in Bosnia of about 60 , 000 troops . Already , more than 25 other nations , including our major NATO allies , have pledged to take part . They will contribute about two thirds of the total implementation force , some 40 , 000 troops . The United States would contribute the rest , about 20 , 000 soldiers . Later this week , the final NATO plan will be submitted to me for review and approval . Let me make clear what I expect it to include , and what it must include , for me to give final approval to the participation of our Armed Forces . First , the mission will be precisely defined with clear , realistic goals that can be achieved in a definite period of time . Our troops will make sure that each side withdraws its forces behind the frontlines and keeps them there . They will maintain the cease fire to prevent the war from accidentally starting again . These efforts , in turn , will help to create a secure environment , so that the people of Bosnia can return to their homes , vote in free elections , and begin to rebuild their lives . Our Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded that this mission should and will take about one year . Second , the risks to our troops will be minimized . American troops will take their orders from the American general who commands NATThey will be heavily armed and thoroughly trained . By making an overwhelming show of force , they will lessen the need to use force . But unlike the forces , they will have the authority to respond immediately , and the training and the equipment to respond with overwhelming force to any threat to their own safety or any violations of the military provisions of the peace agreement . If the NATO plan meets with my approval I will immediately send it to Congress and request its support . I will also authorize the participation of a small number of American troops in a NATO advance mission that will lay the groundwork for IFOstarting sometime next week . They will establish headquarters and set up the sophisticated communication systems that must be in place before NATO can send in its troops , tanks , and trucks to Bosnia . The implementation force itself would begin deploying in Bosnia in the days following the formal signature of the peace agreement in mid December . The international community will help to implement arms control provisions of the agreement so that future hostilities are less likely and armaments are limited , while the world community , the United States and others , will also make sure that the Bosnian Federation has the means to defend itself once IFOR withdraws . IFOR will not be a part of this effort . Civilian agencies from around the world will begin a separate program of humanitarian relief and reconstruction , principally paid for by our European allies and other interested countries . This effort is also absolutely essential to making the peace endure . It will bring the people of Bosnia the food , shelter , clothing , and medicine so many have been denied for so long . It will help them to rebuild to rebuild their roads and schools , their power plants and hospitals , their factories and shops . It will reunite children with their parents and families with their homes . It will allow the Bosnians freely to choose their own leaders . It will give all the people of Bosnia a much greater stake in peace than war , so that peace takes on a life and a logic of its own . In Bosnia we can and will succeed because our mission is clear and limited , and our troops are strong and very well prepared . But my fellow Americans , no deployment of American troops is risk free , and this one may well involve casualties . There may be accidents in the field or incidents with people who have not given up their hatred . I will take every measure possible to minimize these risks , but we must be prepared for that possibility . As President my most difficult duty is to put the men and women who volunteer to serve our Nation in harm s way when our interests and values demand it . I assume full responsibility for any harm that may come to them . But anyone contemplating any action that would endanger our troops should know this America protects its own . Anyone anyone who takes on our troops will suffer the consequences . We will fight fire with fire and then some . After so much bloodshed and loss , after so many outrageous acts of inhuman brutality , it will take an extraordinary effort of will for the people of Bosnia to pull themselves from their past and start building a future of peace . But with our leadership and the commitment of our allies , the people of Bosnia can have the chance to decide their future in peace . They have a chance to remind the world that just a few short years ago the mosques and churches of Sarajevo were a shining symbol of multiethnic tolerance , that Bosnia once found unity in its diversity . Indeed , the cemetery in the center of the city was just a few short years ago a magnificent stadium which hosted the Olympics , our universal symbol of peace and harmony . Bosnia can be that kind of place again . We must not turn our backs on Bosnia now . And so I ask all Americans , and I ask every Member of Congress , Democrat and Republican alike , to make the choice for peace . In the choice between peace and war , America must choose peace . My fellow Americans , I ask you to think just for a moment about this century that is drawing to close and the new one that will soon begin . Because previous generations of Americans stood up for freedom and because we continue to do so , the American people are more secure and more prosperous . And all around the world , more people than ever before live in freedom . More people than ever before are treated with dignity . More people than ever before can hope to build a better life . That is what America s leadership is all about . We know that these are the blessings of freedom . And America has always been freedom s greatest champion . If we continue to do everything we can to share these blessings with people around the world , if we continue to be leaders for peace , then the next century can be the greatest time our Nation has ever known . A few weeks ago , I was privileged to spend some time with His Holiness , Pope John Paul Iwhen he came to America . At the very end of our meeting , the Pope looked at me and said , I have lived through most of this century . I remember that it began with a war in Sarajevo . President , you must not let it end with a war in Sarajevo . In Bosnia , this terrible war has challenged our interests and troubled our souls . Thankfully , we can do something about it . I say again , our mission will be clear , limited , and achievable . The people of Bosnia , our NATO allies , and people all around the world are now looking to America for leadership . So let us lead . That is our responsibility as Americans . Goodnight , and God bless America .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans , tonight for the first time in 79 days , the skies over Yugoslavia are silent . The Serb army and police are withdrawing from Kosovo . The one million men , women , and children driven from their land are preparing to return home . The demands of an outraged and united international community have been met . I can report to the American people that we have achieved a victory for a safer world , for our democratic values , and for a stronger America . Our pilots have returned to base . The airstrikes have been suspended . Aggression against an innocent people has been contained and is being turned back . When I ordered our Armed Forces into combat , we had three clear goals to enable the Kosovar people , the victims of some of the most vicious atrocities in Europe since the Second World War , to return to their homes with safety and self government to require Serbian forces responsible for those atrocities to leave Kosovo and to deploy an international security force , with NATO at its core , to protect all the people of that troubled land , Serbs and Albanians , alike . Those goals will be achieved . A necessary conflict has been brought to a just and honorable conclusion . The result will be security and dignity for the people of Kosovo , achieved by an alliance that stood together in purpose and resolve , assisted by the diplomatic efforts of Russia . This victory brings a new hope that when a people are singled out for destruction because of their heritage and religious faith and we can do something about it , the world will not look the other way . I want to express my profound gratitude to the men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our Allies . Day after day , night after night , they flew , risking their lives to attack their targets and to avoid civilian casualties when they were fired upon from populated areas . I ask every American to join me in saying to them , thank you , you have made us very proud . I am also grateful to the American people for standing against the awful ethnic cleansing , for sending generous assistance to the refugees , and for opening your hearts and your homes to the innocent victims who came here . I want to speak with you for a few moments tonight about why we fought , what we achieved , and what we have to do now to advance the peace , and together with the people of the Balkans , forge a future of freedom , progress , and harmony . We should remember that the violence we responded to in Kosovo was the culmination of a 10 year campaign by Slobodan Milosevic , the leader of Serbia , to exploit ethnic and religious differences in order to impose his will on the lands of the former Yugoslavia . That is what he tried to do in Croatia and in Bosnia , and now in Kosovo . The world saw the terrifying consequences 500 villages burned men of all ages separated from their loved ones to be shot and buried in mass graves women raped children made to watch their parents die a whole people forced to abandon , in hours , communities their families had spent generations building . For these atrocities , Milosevic and his top aides have been indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity . I will never forget the Kosovar refugees I recently met . Some of them could barely talk about what they had been through . All they had left was hope that the world would not turn its back . When our diplomatic efforts to avert this horror were rebuffed and the violence mounted , we and our Allies chose to act . Milosevic continued to do terrible things to the people of Kosovo , but we were determined to turn him back . Our firmness finally has brought an end to a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing , and we acted early enough to reverse it , to enable the Kosovars to go home . When they do , they will be safe . They will be able to reopen their schools , speak their language , practice their religion , choose their leaders , and shape their destiny . There ll be no more days of foraging for food in the cold of mountains and forests , no more nights of hiding in cellars , wondering if the next day will bring death or deliverance . They will know that Milosevic s army and paramilitary forces will be gone , his 10 year campaign of repression finished . NATO has achieved this success as a united alliance , ably led by Secretary General Solana and General Clark . Nineteen democracies came together and stayed together through the stiffest military challenge in NATO s 50 year history . We also preserved our critically important partnership with Russia , thanks to President Yeltsin , who opposed our military effort but supported diplomacy to end the conflict on terms that met our conditions . I am grateful to Russian envoy Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Ahtisaari for their work , and to Vice President Gore for the key role he played in putting their partnership together . Now , I hope Russian troops will join us in the force that will keep the peace in Kosovo , just as they have in Bosnia . Finally , we have averted the wider war this conflict might well have sparked . The countries of southeastern Europe backed the NATO campaign , helped the refugees , and showed the world there is more compassion than cruelty in this troubled region . This victory makes it all the more likely that they will choose a future of democracy , fair treatment of minorities , and peace . Now we are entering a new phase , building that peace , and there are formidable challenges . First , we must be sure the Serbian authorities meet their commitments . We are prepared to resume our military campaign should they fail to do so . Next , we must get the Kosovar refugees home safely mine fields will have to be cleared homes destroyed by Serb forces will have to be rebuilt homeless people in need of food and medicine will have to get them the fate of the missing will have to be determined the Kosovar Liberation Army will have to demilitarize , as it has agreed to do . And we in the peacekeeping force will have to ensure that Kosovo is a safe place to live for all its citizens , ethnic Serbs as well as ethnic Albanians . For these things to happen , security must be established . To that end , some 50 , 000 troops from almost 30 countries will deploy to Kosovo . Our European Allies will provide the vast majority of them America will contribute about 7 , 000 . We are grateful that during NATO s air campaign we did not lose a single serviceman in combat . But this next phase also will be dangerous . Bitter memories will still be fresh , and there may well be casualties . So we have made sure that the force going into Kosovo will have NATO command and control and rules of engagement set by NATIt will have the means and the mandate to protect itself while doing its job . In the meantime , the United Nations will organize a civilian administration while preparing the Kosovars to govern and police themselves . As local institutions take hold , NATO will be able to turn over increasing responsibility to them and draw down its forces . A third challenge will be to put in place a plan for lasting peace and stability in Kosovo and through all the Balkans . For that to happen , the European Union and the United States must plan for tomorrow , not just today . We must help to give the democracies of southeastern Europe a path to a prosperous , shared future , a unifying magnet more powerful than the pull of hatred and destruction that has threatened to tear them apart . Our European partners must provide most of the resources for this effort , but it is in America s interest to do our part , as well . A final challenge will be to encourage Serbia to join its neighbors in this historic journey to a peaceful , democratic , united Europe . I want to say a few words to the Serbian people tonight . I know that you , too , have suffered in Milosevic s wars . You should know that your leaders could have kept Kosovo as a part of your country without driving a single Kosovar family from its home , without killing a single adult or child , without inviting a single NATO bomb to fall on your country . You endured 79 days of bombing , not to keep Kosovo a province of Serbia , but simply because Milosevic was determined to eliminate Kosovar Albanians from Kosovo , dead or alive . As long as he remains in power , as long as your nation is ruled by an indicted war criminal , we will provide no support for the reconstruction of Serbia . But we are ready to provide humanitarian aid now and to help to build a better future for Serbia , too , when its Government represents tolerance and freedom , not repression and terror . My fellow Americans , all these challenges are substantial , but they are far preferable to the challenges of war and continued instability in Europe . We have sent a message of determination and hope to all the world . Think of all the millions of innocent people who died in this bloody century because democracies reacted too late to evil and aggression . Because of our resolve , the 20th century is ending not with helpless indignation but with a hopeful affirmation of human dignity and human rights for the 21st century . In a world too divided by fear among people of different racial , ethnic , and religious groups , we have given confidence to the friends of freedom and pause to those who would exploit human difference for inhuman purposes . America still faces great challenges in this world , but we look forward to meeting them . So , tonight I ask you to be proud of your country and very proud of the men and women who serve it in uniform . For in Kosovo , we did the right thing we did it the right way and we will finish the job . Good night , and may God bless our wonderful United States of America .<speech_sep>Thank you . President and Rawlings , honorable ministers , honorable members of the Council of State , honorable Members of Parliament , honorable members of the Judiciary , nananom , and the people of Ghana . Mitsea mu . America fuo kyia mo . Now you have shown me what akwaaba really means . Thank you , thank you so much . I am proud to be the first American President ever to visit Ghana and to go on to Uganda , Rwanda , South Africa , Botswana , and Senegal . It is a journey long overdue . America should have done it before , and I am proud to be on that journey . Thank you for welcoming me . I want to listen and to learn . I want to build a future partnership between our two people , and I want to introduce the people of the United States , through my trip , to the new face of Africa . From Kampala to Cape Town , from Dakar to Dar Es Salaam , Africans are being stirred by new hopes for democracy and peace and prosperity . Challenges remain , but they must be to all of you a call to action , not a cause for despair . You must draw strength from the past and energy from the promise of a new future . My dream for this trip is that together we might do the things so that , 100 years from now , your grandchildren and mine will look back and say this was the beginning of a new African renaissance . With a new century coming into view , old patterns are fading away The cold war is gone colonialism is gone apartheid is gone . Remnants of past troubles remain . But surely , there will come a time when everywhere reconciliation will replace recrimination . Now , nations and individuals finally are free to seek a newer world where democracy and peace and prosperity are not slogans but the essence of a new Africa . Africa has changed so much in just 10 years . Dictatorship has been replaced so many places . Half of the 48 nations in sub Saharan Africa choose their own governments , leading a new generation willing to learn from the past and imagine a future . Though democracy has not yet gained a permanent foothold even in most successful nations , there is everywhere a growing respect for tolerance , diversity , and elemental human rights . A decade ago , business was stifled . Now , Africans are embracing economic reform . Today from Ghana to Mozambique , from Cote d Ivoire to Uganda , growing economies are fueling a transformation in Africa . For all this promise , you and I know Africa is not free from peril the genocide in Rwanda civil wars in Sierra Leone , Liberia , both Congos pariah states that export violence and terror military dictatorship in Nigeria and high levels of poverty , malnutrition , disease , illiteracy , and unemployment . To fulfill the vast promise of a new era , Africa must face these challenges . We must build classrooms and companies , increase the food supply and save the environment , and prevent disease before deadly epidemics break out . The United States is ready to help you . First , my fellow Americans must leave behind the stereotypes that have warped our view and weakened our understanding of Africa . We need to come to know Africa as a place of new beginning and ancient wisdom from which , as my wife , our First Lady , said in her book , we have so much to learn . It is time for Americans to put a new Africa on our map . Here in Independence Square , Ghana blazed the path of that new Africa . More than four decades ago , Kwame Nkrumah proposed what he called a motion of destiny as Ghana stepped forward as a free and independent nation . Today , Ghana again lights the way for Africa . Democracy is spreading . Business is growing . Trade and investment are rising . Ghana has the only African owned company today on our New York Stock Exchange . You have worked hard to preserve the peace in Africa and around the world from Liberia to Lebanon , from Croatia to Cambodia . And you have given the world a statesman and peacemaker in Kofi Annan to lead the United Nations . The world admires your success . The United States admires your success . We see it taking root throughout the new Africa . And we stand ready to support it . First , we want to work with Africa to nurture democracy , knowing it is never perfect or complete . We have learned in over 200 years that every day democracy must be defended and a more perfect union can always lie ahead . Democracy requires more than the insults and injustice and inequality that so many societies have known and America has known . Democracy requires human rights for everyone , everywhere , for men and women , for children and the elderly , for people of different cultures and tribes and backgrounds . A good society honors its entire family . Second , democracy must have prosperity . Americans of both political parties want to increase trade and investment in Africa . We have an African Growth and Opportunity Act now before Congress . Both parties leadership are supporting it . By opening markets and building businesses and creating jobs , we can help and strengthen each other . By supporting the education of your people , we can strengthen your future and help each other . For centuries , other nations exploited Africa s gold , Africa s diamonds , Africa s minerals . Now is the time for Africans to cultivate something more precious , the mind and heart of the people of Africa , through education . Third , we must allow democracy and prosperity to take root without violence . We must work to resolve the war and genocide that still tear at the heart of Africa . We must help Africans to prevent future conflicts . Here in Ghana , you have shown the world that different peoples can live together in harmony . You have proved that Africans of different countries can unite to help solve disputes in neighboring countries . Peace everywhere in Africa will give more free time and more money to the pressing needs of our children s future . The killing must stop if a new future is to begin . Fourth and finally , for peace and prosperity and democracy to prevail , you must protect your magnificent natural domain . Africa is mankind s first home . We all came out of Africa . We must preserve the magnificent natural environment that is left . We must manage the water and forest . We must learn to live in harmony with other species . You must learn how to fight drought and famine and global warming . And we must share with you the technology that will enable you to preserve your environment and provide more economic opportunity to your people . America has good reason to work with Africa 30 million Americans , more than one in ten , proudly trace their heritage here . The first Peace Corps volunteers from America came to Ghana over 35 years ago over 57 , 000 have served in Africa since then . Through blood ties and common endeavors , we know we share the same hopes and dreams to provide for ourselves and our children , to live in peace and worship freely , to build a better life than our parents knew and pass a brighter future on to our children . America needs Africa , America needs Ghana as a partner in the fight for a better future . So many of our problems do not stop at any nation s border , international crime and terrorism and drug trafficking , the degradation of the environment , the spread of diseases like AIDS and malaria , and so many of our opportunities cannot stop at a nation s border . We need partners to deepen the meaning of democracy in America , in Africa , and throughout the world . We need partners to build prosperity . We need partners to live in peace . We will not build this new partnership overnight , but perseverance creates its own reward . An Ashanti proverb tells us that by coming and going , a bird builds its nest . We will come and go with you and do all we can as you build the new Africa , a work that must begin here in Africa , not with aid or trade , though they are important , but first with ordinary citizens , especially the young people in this audience today . You must feel the winds of freedom blowing at your back , pushing you onward to a brighter future . There are roughly 700 days left until the end of this century and the beginning of a new millennium . There are roughly 700 million Africans in sub Saharan Africa . Every day and every individual is a precious opportunity . We do not have a moment to lose , and we do not have a person to lose . I ask you , my friends , to let me indulge a moment of our shared history in closing . In 1957 our great civil rights leader , Martin Luther King , came to Accra to help represent our country as Ghana celebrated its independence . He was deeply moved by the birth of your nation . Six years later , on the day after E . Du Bois died here in Ghana in 1963 , King spoke to an enormous gathering like this in Washington . He said these simple words I have a dream , a dream that all Americans might live free and equal as brothers and sisters . His dream became the dream of our Nation and changed us in ways we could never have imagined . We are hardly finished , but we have traveled a long way on the wings of that dream . Du Bois , a towering African American intellectual , died here as a citizen of Ghana and a friend of Kwame Nkrumah . He once wrote , The habit of democracy must be to encircle the Earth . Let us together resolve to complete the circle of democracy , to dream the dream that all people on the entire Earth will be free and equal , to begin a new century with that commitment to freedom and justice for all , to redeem the promise inscribed right here on Independence Arch . Let us find a future here in Africa , the cradle of humanity . Medase . America dase . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Father Creedon , Kennedy , the children of Robert Kennedy , and the Kennedy family , to all the distinguished Americans here present , and most of all , to all of you who bear the noble title , citizen of this country Twenty five years ago today , on the eve of my college graduation , I cheered the victory of Robert Kennedy in the California primary and felt again that our country might face its problems openly , meet its challenges bravely , and go forward together . He dared us all . He dared the grieving not to retreat into despair . He dared the comfortable not to be complacent . He dared the doubting to keep going . As I looked around this crowd today and saw us all graced not only by the laughter of children but by the tears of those of us old enough to remember , it struck me again that the memory of Robert Kennedy is so powerful that in a profound way we are all in two places today . We are here and now , and we are there , then . For in Robert Kennedy we all invested our hopes and our dreams that somehow we might redeem the promise of the America we then feared we were losing , somehow we might call back the promise of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King and heal the divisions of Vietnam and the violence and pain in our own country . But I believe if Robert Kennedy were here today , he would dare us not to mourn his passing but to fulfill his promise and to be the people that he so badly wanted us all to be . He would dare us to leave yesterday and embrace tomorrow . We remember him , almost captured in freeze frame , standing on the hood of a car , grasping at outreached hands , black and brown and white . His promise was that the hands which reached out to him might someday actually reach out to each other . And together , those hands could make America everything that it ought to be , a nation reunited with itself and rededicated to its best ideals . When his funeral train passed through the gritty cities of the Northeast , people from both sides of the tracks stood silent . He had earned their respect because he went to places most leaders never visit and listened to people most leaders never hear and spoke simple truth most leaders never speak . He spoke out against neglect , but he challenged the neglected to seize their own destiny . He wanted so badly for Government to act , but he did not trust bureaucracy . And he believed that Government had to do things with people , not for them . He knew we had to do things together or not at all . He spoke to the sons and daughters of immigrants and the sons and daughters of sharecroppers and told them all , As long as you stay apart from each other , you will never be what you ought to be . He saw the word not in terms of right and left but right and wrong . And he taught us lessons that cannot be labeled except as powerful proof . Robert Kennedy reminded us that on any day , in any place , at any time , racism is wrong , exploitation is wrong , violence is wrong , anything that denies the simple humanity and potential of any man or woman is wrong . He touched children whose stomachs were swollen with hunger but whose eyes still sparkled with life . He marched with workers who strained their backs for poverty wages while harvesting our food . He walked down city streets with people who ached , not from work but from the lack of it . Then as now , his piercing eyes and urgent voice speak of the things we all like to think that we believe in . When he was alive , some said he was ruthless . Some said he was not a real liberal , and others claimed he was a real radical . If he were here today , I think he would laugh and say they were both right . But now as we see him more clearly , we understand he was a man who was very gentle to those who were most vulnerable , very tough in the standards he kept for himself , very old fashioned in the virtues in which he believed , and a relentless searcher for change , for growth , for the potential of heart and mind that he sought in himself and he demanded of others . Robert Kennedy understood that the real purpose of leadership is to bring out the best in others . He believed the destiny of our Nation is the sum total of all the decisions that all of us make . He often said that one person can make a difference , and each of us must try . Some still believe we lost what is best about America when President Kennedy and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed . But I ask you to remember , my fellow Americans , that Robert Kennedy did not lose his faith when his own brother was killed . And when Martin Luther King was killed , he gave from his heart what was perhaps his finest speech . He lifted himself from despair time after time and went back to work . If you listen now you can hear with me his voice telling me and telling you and telling everyone here , We can do better . Today s troubles call us to do better . The legacy of Robert Kennedy is a stem rebuke to the cynicism , to the trivialization that grips so much of our public life today . What use is it in the face of the aching problems gripping millions of Americans , the American without a job , the American without health care , the American without a safe street to live on or a good school to send a child to What use is it in the face of all the divisions that keep our country down and rob our children of their rightful future Let us learn here once again the simple , powerful , beautiful lesson , the simple faith of Robert Kennedy We can do better . Let us leave here no longer in two places , but once again in one only in the here and now , with a commitment to tomorrow , the only part of our time that we can control . Let us embrace the memory of Robert Kennedy by living as he would have us to live . For the sake of his memory , of ourselves , and of all of our children and all those to come , let us believe again , we can do better .<speech_sep>My fellow citizens , today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal . This ceremony is held in the depth of winter , but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world , we force the spring , a spring reborn in the world s oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America . When our Founders boldly declared America s independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty , they knew that America , to endure , would have to change not change for change s sake but change to preserve America s ideals life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness . Though we marched to the music of our time , our mission is timeless . Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American . On behalf of our Nation , I salute my predecessor , President Bush , for his half century of service to America . And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression , fascism , and communism . Today , a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues . Raised in unrivaled prosperity , we inherit an economy that is still the world s strongest but is weakened by business failures , stagnant wages , increasing inequality , and deep divisions among our own people . When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold , news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat . Now , the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world . Communications and commerce are global . Investment is mobile . Technology is almost magical . And ambition for a better life is now universal . We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth . Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world . And the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy . This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it . But when most people are working harder for less when others cannot work at all when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises , great and small when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead , we have not made change our friend . We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps , but we have not done so instead , we have drifted . And that drifting has eroded our resources , fractured our economy , and shaken our confidence . Though our challenges are fearsome , so are our strengths . Americans have ever been a restless , questing , hopeful people . And we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us . From our Revolution to the Civil War , to the Great Depression , to the civil rights movement , our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history . Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our Nation , we would need dramatic change from time to time . Well , my fellow Americans , this is our time . Let us embrace it . Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal . There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America . And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift , and a new season of American renewal has begun . To renew America , we must be bold . We must do what no generation has had to do before . We must invest more in our own people , in their jobs , and in their future , and at the same time cut our massive debt . And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity . It will not be easy . It will require sacrifice , but it can be done and done fairly , not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake . We must provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children . Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity . We can do no less . Anyone who has ever watched a child s eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is . Posterity is the world to come the world for whom we hold our ideals , from whom we have borrowed our planet , and to whom we bear sacred responsibility . We must do what America does best offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all . It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our Government or from each other . Let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country . To renew America , we must revitalize our democracy . This beautiful Capital , like every capital since the dawn of civilization , is often a place of intrigue and calculation . Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out , who is up and who is down , forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way . Americans deserve better . And in this city today there are people who want to do better . And so I say to all of you here Let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people . Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America . Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold , persistent experimentation , a Government for our tomorrows , not our yesterdays . Let us give this Capital back to the people to whom it belongs . To renew America , we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home . There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic . The world economy , the world environment , the world AIDS crisis , the world arms race they affect us all . Today , as an older order passes , the new world is more free but less stable . Communism s collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers . Clearly , America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make . While America rebuilds at home , we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world . Together with our friends and allies , we will work to shape change , lest it engulf us . When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied , we will act , with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible , with force when necessary . The brave Americans serving our Nation today in the Persian Gulf , in Somalia , and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve . But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas , which are still new in many lands . Across the world we see them embraced , and we rejoice . Our hopes , our hearts , our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom . Their cause is America s cause . The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today . You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus . You have cast your votes in historic numbers . And you have changed the face of Congress , the Presidency , and the political process itself . Yes , you , my fellow Americans , have forced the spring . Now we must do the work the season demands . To that work I now turn with all the authority of my office . I ask the Congress to join with me . But no President , no Congress , no Government can undertake this mission alone . My fellow Americans , you , too , must play your part in our renewal . I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service to act on your idealism by helping troubled children , keeping company with those in need , reconnecting our torn communities . There is so much to be done enough , indeed , for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service , too . In serving , we recognize a simple but powerful truth We need each other , and we must care for one another . Today we do more than celebrate America . We rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America , an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge an idea tempered by the knowledge that , but for fate , we , the fortunate , and the unfortunate might have been each other an idea ennobled by the faith that our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity an idea infused with the conviction that America s long , heroic journey must go forever upward . And so , my fellow Americans , as we stand at the edge of the 21st century , let us begin anew with energy and hope , with faith and discipline . And let us work until our work is done . The Scripture says , And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not . From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley . We have heard the trumpets . We have changed the guard . And now , each in our own way and with God s help , we must answer the call . Thank you , and God bless you all .<speech_sep>Thank you . Thank you very much . I feel good today , do you Thank you . Reverend Washington Presiding Elder Reverend Andrews Governor Chiles Congressman and Gibbons our fine congressional candidate , Jim Davis , welcome , sir . We are proud of you . To my other friends who have joined us in this church today , and to all of you , thank you for making us feel so welcome here in the house of the Lord . I was sort of tired when I came in , and I got into the music , and then we started singing about the little shack by the railroad track and I said a lot of us in this house of God have lived in a little shack by the railroad track . And we did have a good time . My grandfather used to joke with me that if we did not have any better sense than to know we were poor , we could have a good time . And we are having a good time today . I am honored to be in this historic pulpit which has been graced by Martin Luther King , Thurgood Marshall , Adam Clayton Powell , Jackie Robinson . I am humbled to be here . And I would like to say , first and foremost , I thank you , all of you , for giving me the chance to serve as the President of the greatest country in human history for the last 4 years . Thank you . Thank you . In just 2 days all of us together will go to the polls to select the last President of this unbelievable 20th century , the century of the civil rights movement , the century of two great World Wars and the Great Depression , the century of the cold war , a century of more bloodshed than any in history , but a century of remarkable progress as more and more people move toward the realization that all of us are created equal in the eyes of God , are entitled to live as equals in the eyes of God the masters of our fate , save only in subjugation to our God . And with a vast new century stretching before us we know that the world is changing in ways we cannot fully understand . Just think about all the changes you have seen here in your community in the last 4 or 5 years . Think about the changes technology is bringing in the way we work and live and relate to one another and the rest of the world . Think about how much more involved in the rest of the world we are today than ever before . We have a decision to make that goes way beyond the vote on Tuesday . And frankly , it goes way beyond Democrats and Republicans , way beyond even the choice for President . It goes far out into the future and deep into the human heart . We have to decide as a people how we are going to keep walking into that 21st century and whether we will say to each other , You are on your own , or we are going to build a bridge together so that everyone has the tools to make the most of his or her own life . And we have to decide whether we are going to build that bridge on the shifting sands of division or on the strong rock of common ground . I believe I know what your decision would be . I was so glad to hear that wonderful passage from John about the Pool of Bethesda . When I went to the Holy Land for the first time about 15 years ago , I was looking for the Pool of Bethesda because it is a great remembrance that when the angel whirled the waters and made it possible for people to go there and find healing power , Jesus thought the healing power ought to be given even to the one who could not even get to the pool . No one was left out . Even the one who could not even get to the pool was given the healing power of the Spirit . That is a lesson for us . When people tell me , well , some people just are not going to make it , I say that is true , but it ought to be their fault , not ours . It ought to be their fault , not ours . We cannot give anybody a guarantee in life . Even the man crawling to the pool had to believe . His body would not move , but his mind would . So I do not seek to give anybody a guarantee , but I think everybody ought to have a chance . You know , after the events of the last week , when we are divided we defeat ourselves . How heartbreaking it is on this Lord s day that there is still no peace in the Holy Land . A year ago tomorrow , the Prime Minister of Israel was murdered by one of his own people because he sought to bring peace to the Holy Land . The place where the three great religions of the world that believe we are all created by one God , all of us and all of our differences are created by one God , claim as holy , they are still fighting over religion . In Bosnia , a place where the ethnic groups are divided into three by accident of political and military history , not because they are biologically distinguishable , they are still fighting over their differences . Science has not gotten in the way of believing that they are inherently different . That is what they believe . In Africa today , the Hutus and the Tutsis share poor lands with poor children who desperately need the product of earnest , sustained , loving , cooperative labor somehow find it more profitable to slaughter each other and make the land poorer . Well , that is why when our Federal Government employees are singled out for hatred , when a horrible tragedy like Oklahoma City occurs , when a black or a white church is burned or a synagogue or a mosque is defaced in America , we must stand against that , because we know that we are all in this together , that we are going to rise or fall together , that we have a duty to help each other in our work , in our family , in our lives as citizens , a duty to live in a way that enables us to find common ground and a responsibility to give everyone else the opportunity to go over that bridge with us into tomorrow . Now , President Lincoln once paraphrased Jesus sermon in Matthew when he said , The house divided against itself cannot stand . I did not have time to go back and read it today , but I believe that the whole verse says A city and a house divided against itself cannot stand not Tampa , not Petersburg , not Washington , Dnot the United States of America . Four years ago , when I asked for this job , I was worried because our people were divided and dispirited and as a result we were not doing together what we should have been doing to lift our economy or deal with the whole array of problems plaguing our society , involving so many of our children , of their futures . Now , I know I am preaching to a choir today but in the next 2 days we need the choir to preach . We will never be what we ought to be if we allow our country to be led by those who believe we are better off on our own and who seek to pursue that path by driving wedges between us and exploiting our fears and convincing us that our brothers and sisters of different races , different faiths , different walks of life are our inherent enemies . That is the prescription for disaster in the Holy Land , in Bosnia , in Africa , and in the United States . And we have only become greater at each stage along the way because every time we had to face the music we chose common ground over the shifting sands of division . And that is what we must do again in this season of our decision . We have seen the results of the politics of division and gridlock , but now we have seen the results of the politics of opportunity and responsibility and the common ground we seek to build in our American community . We have more jobs , a lower deficit , higher growth , the highest rate of homeownership in 15 years , the highest rates of homeownership and small business ownership among African Americans , other minorities , and women in the history of America . It turns out giving everybody a chance , not a guarantee but a chance , is good for the rest of us . While all these big numbers were occurring , we have seen the biggest decline in inequality among working people in 27 years , the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years , the lowest rates of poverty ever recorded for senior citizens and African Americans since the statistics have been kept . It is the right thing to do for all the rest of us to see that everybody has a chance , just as the man struggling for the pool at Bethesda was given his chance . We are seeing the benefits of greater responsibility The welfare rolls are down the crime rate is at a 10 year low . We see in so many other areas 4 years of declining teenage pregnancy , the first drop in out of wedlock pregnancy in 20 years , community efforts building up all over the country , more and more people going in our schools to tell our children that drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you , more and more citizen efforts working with the police to try to help keep the streets safer , more and more communities doing things to try to help our young people stay out of trouble like curfew policies or even school uniform policies and other things . These experiments going on in America , people working together to try to find ways to be responsible citizens . And every place it is done we are better off . We are seeing a deeper sense of community trying to preserve our natural environment for our children and our grandchildren . I thank Governor Chiles for the work he has done on the Everglades . Every person in Florida , in the farthest northern corner of Florida has a stake in that . Every person in the farthest northwest corner of America has a stake in saving our common heritage . We see it in so many other ways . We have been moved by the enormous upswelling of American conviction in the aftermath of Oklahoma City , the reaction to the church burnings being so negative . Our common sense , whenever it prevails to bring us together as a community , makes us stronger . And I really believe we are on the verge of the most exciting period in human history . But we cannot forget what brought us here , because it will take us home . So the trick for us is to find out with God s wisdom how to seize all these fabulous opportunities that are out there in a way that enables us to move closer to our values . It is really true that none of us live by bread alone . I do not know any serious person who is lived long enough who believes that with all the bread in the world you can be really happy . On the other hand , it is important not to be too self righteous . I always say one of my rules of politics is whenever you hear a person standing on a corner screaming , This is not a money problem , sure as the world he is talking about somebody else s problem , not his . So we need to be a little humble about this . But we have work to do . If you think about what our children can do , if we could put every child in America , from the poorest inner cities to the most remote rural areas , in a classroom with a computer that was hooked up to the entire information superhighway , then for the first time ever every child in America would have access to the same learning in the same way at the same time . That would revolutionize what our children could do , all of our children . If we could put a million citizens with 100 , 000 more police and walk the blocks together , we could have not 4 years but 8 years of declining crime and all of our children could feel safe on their streets and in their schools and in their neighborhoods . We can reclaim our streets . Four years ago millions of people did not believe we could ever do anything about rising crime . Now we have no excuse . We know we can bring it down for 4 years , but we know we have to have about 4 more years before it will be tolerable to live in still a lot of our places . But we can make our streets safe again , we know that . But we will have to do that together . And we can do that in the future . We know that we are breaking down the frontiers of ignorance in so many ways that will help us to cure cancer , that will help us to find ways to grow our economy while we improve our environment , that will help us to find ways to create jobs for people who have never been able to get them before . But we have work to do . I signed a law that says that everybody on welfare who is able bodied will keep getting health care and food and child care if they go to work , but if they are able bodied , they have got to trade the welfare check for a paycheck in 2 years . That is the law . But now we have figured out something we have not really been able to figure out for a long time , which is how to give jobs to people . You cannot tell people they have to go to work unless there is work for them to find . So we have got work to do . We know we have got work to do in building our American family . We know there is still too many kids who do not think drugs will kill them . We know that 3 , 000 children start smoking every day and a thousand will die sooner as a result , even though it is illegal . We know that even though we have removed a lot of assault weapons from our streets and made it harder for criminals to get guns , there is still too many completely innocent children being killed . We know that even though we have demonstrated in our administration that you can have diversity and excellence in my appointments to the Cabinet , to the Federal bench , and throughout the country there are still too many people who are literally afraid to deal as equals with people who are different from them . We know that . We know that there are still too many white people who would not feel as comfortable as I do sitting in this church today . And that is wrong . They read the same Bible you do . They claim the same Saviour you do . They ought to feel at home here . We have got work to do . And you ought to feel at home in their churches . So I say to you , we have work to do . Our best days are still ahead . But we must always marry our progress to the realization of our values . We have to take advantage of progress to move closer to living as we say we believe . We have work to do . And as we get closer and closer and closer to the election , the work passes from my hands to yours again . It is a very humbling thing for me , you know . If you ever doubt whether the people are the boss in the end in a democracy , run for office . Run for office . Even the the President is a hired hand trying to get a contract renewed . It is a humbling thing . There is a power in freedom that you cannot underestimate . We take it for granted . You know , now , in the last few years , for the first time in all of human history , more people are living in democracies on the face of the Earth than dictatorships . It is the first time in all of human history , just in the last few years . Think how far your ancestors walked , think how many bled and died to give you the right to vote . And think what a blessing it is that you are anchored in what you believe and that you are not subject to the wild winds that often blow through the airwaves at election time . I ask you to let me share this story as I close . In 1992 , when I was seeking this office , I was in a church much like this in Cleveland one night . It was a warm night , and the church was without air conditioner at least the air conditioner was unequal to the hot air all the public officials were spewing out . And we were packed in that church . And it was one of those meetings , you know , where everybody there talked but three people , and they went home mad . Everybody talked . We all got to talk . And the temperature rose , and people started wanting to get out . And the great pastor in that church stood up , who is a friend of mine , Reverend Otis Moss , one of America s great preachers some of you may know him . And he started talking to the people about the simple act of voting . And he said , You know , my father could not vote the law did not allow him to vote . And finally , one day the law was changed , and he could vote . And he walked 7 miles to the polling place . But the people did not want my father to vote , and they said , Moss , you are at the wrong place . So they sent him to another place , and he walked a couple of more miles . And they said , Moss , you are still at the wrong place . And they sent him to another place , and he had to walk a couple of more miles . And when they got there , they said , Moss , the polls have closed . And he said , When my daughter was old enough to vote , I took her to the polling place , and we went together to two voting machines side by side . And I know you are not supposed to linger in the ballot booth . But I could not vote . I put my ear right next to that booth until I heard my daughter vote . We do not miss votes at our house , he said . This is a day that the Lord hath made let us rejoice and be glad in it . And let us remember that here on Earth , God s work must truly be our own . We have work to do . But if we do it and if we remember , like Jesus , that even the man who could not reach the pool at Bethesda , we will all go forward on that bridge to the 21st century together . Thank you , and God bless you .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . I am sorry , we had a last minute delay occasioned by another issue , not this one . The debate over whether to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military has , to put it mildly , sparked a great deal of interest over the last few days . Today , as you know , I have reached an agreement , at least with Senator Nunn and Senator Mitchell , about how we will proceed in the next few days . But first I would like to explain what I believe about this issue and why , and what I have decided to do after a long conversation , and a very good one , with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and discussions with several Members of Congress . The issue is not whether there should be homosexuals in the military . Everyone concedes that there are . The issue is whether men and women who can and have served with real distinction should be excluded from military service solely on the basis of their status . And I believe they should not . The principle on which I base this position is this I believe that American citizens who want to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualifies them from doing so . Military life is fundamentally different from civilian society it necessarily has a different and stricter code of conduct , even a different code of justice . Nonetheless , individuals who are prepared to accept all necessary restrictions on their behavior , many of which would be intolerable in civilian society , should be able to serve their country honorably and well . I have asked the Secretary of Defense to submit by July the 15th a draft Executive order , after full consultation with military and congressional leaders and concerned individuals outside of the Government , which would end the present policy of the exclusion from military service solely on the basis of sexual orientation and at the same time establish rigorous standards regarding sexual conduct to be applied to all military personnel . This draft order will be accompanied by a study conducted during the next 6 months on the real , practical problems that would be involved in this revision of policy , so that we will have a practical , realistic approach consistent with the high standards of combat effectiveness and unit cohesion that our armed services must maintain . I agree with the Joint Chiefs that the highest standards of conduct must be required . The change cannot and should not be accomplished overnight . It does require extensive consultation with the Joint Chiefs , experts in the Congress and in the legal community , joined by my administration and others . We have consulted closely to date and will do so in the future . During that process , interim measures will be placed into effect which , I hope , again , sharpen the focus of this debate . The Joint Chiefs of Staff have agreed to remove the question regarding one s sexual orientation from future versions of the enlistment application , and it will not be asked in the interim . We also all agree that a very high standard of conduct can and must be applied . So the single area of disagreement is this Should someone be able to serve their country in uniform if they say they are homosexuals , but they do nothing which violates the code of conduct or undermines unit cohesion or morale , apart from that statement That is what all the furor of the last few days has been about . And the practical and not insignificant issues raised by that issue are what will be studied in the next 6 months . Through this period ending July 15th , the Department of Justice will seek continuances in pending court cases involving reinstatement . And administrative separation under current Department of Defense policies based on status alone will be stayed pending completion of this review . The final discharge in cases based only on status will be suspended until the President has an opportunity to review and act upon the final recommendations of the Secretary of Defense with respect to the current policy . In the meantime , a member whose discharge has been suspended by the Attorney General will be separated from active duty and placed in standby reserve until the final report of the Secretary of Defense and the final action of the President . This is the agreement that I have reached with Senator Nunn and Senator Mitchell . During this review process , I will work with the Congress . And I believe the compromise announced today by the Senators and by me shows that we can work together to end the gridlock that has plagued our city for too long . This compromise is not everything I would have hoped for or everything that I have stood for , but it is plainly a substantial step in the right direction . And it will allow us to move forward on other terribly important issues affecting far more Americans . My administration came to this city with a mission to bring critical issues of reform and renewal and economic revitalization to the public debate , issues that are central to the lives of all Americans . We are working on an economic reform agenda that will begin with an address to the joint session of Congress on February 17th . In the coming months the White House Task Force on Health Care , chaired by the First Lady , will complete work on a comprehensive health care reform proposal to be submitted to Congress within 100 days of the commencement of this administration . We will be designing a system of national service to begin a season of service in which our Nation s unmet needs are addressed and we provide more young people the opportunity to go to college . We will be proposing comprehensive welfare reform legislation and other important initiatives . I applaud the work that has been done in the last 2 or 3 days by Senator Nunn , Senator Mitchell , and others to enable us to move forward on a principle that is important to me without shutting the Government down and running the risk of not even addressing the family and medical leave issue , which is so important to America s families , before Congress goes into its recess . I am looking forward to getting on with this issue over the next 6 months and with these other issues which were so central to the campaign and , far more importantly , are so important to the lives of all the American people . Well , it makes one point . I think it strengthens my hand , if you will , in two ways . One , I agree with the principle embodied in the case . I have not read the opinion , but as I understand it , the opinion draws the distinction that I seek to draw between conduct and status . And secondly , it makes the practical point I have been making all along , which is that there is not insignificant chance that this matter would ultimately be resolved in the courts in a way that would open admission into the military without the opportunity to deal with this whole range of practical issues , which everyone who has ever thought about it or talked it through concedes are there . So I think it can it strengthens my hand on the principle as well as on the process . Well , I have not given up on my real goals . I think this is a dramatic step forward . Normally , in the history of civil rights advancements , Presidents have not necessarily been in the forefront in the beginning . So I think the fact that we actually have the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreeing that it is time to take this question off the enlistment form , that there ought to be a serious examination of how this would be done , even though they have not agreed that it should be done that the Senate , if they vote for the motion advocated by Senators Nunn and Mitchell , will agree Senators who do not agree that the policy should be changed are agreeing that we ought to have a chance to work through this for 6 months and persuade them of that , I think , is very , very significant . Now , I would remind you that any President s Executive order can be overturned by an act of Congress . The President can then veto the act of Congress and try to have his veto sustained if the act stands on its own as a simple issue that could always be vetoed . But I always knew that there was a chance that Congress would disagree with my position . I can only tell you that I still think I am right I feel comfortable about the way we have done this and I am going to maintain the commitment that I have . No , I had always planned to allow some period of time during which policies would be developed to deal with what I think are the significant practical problems . This , in effect , may reverse the process over what I intended to do , but there has to be a time in which these issues , these practical issues are developed and policies are developed to deal with them . I do not know how I could have done that . The Joint Chiefs asked for a meeting about a number of issues , in which this was only one . We spent a lot of time talking about other things . This issue was not put forward in this context by me it was put forward by those in the United States Senate who sought to make it an issue early on . And I do not know how I could have stopped them from doing that . Well , I think it was pretty clear to me that we were talking about some sort of 6 month process days and days ago . And the people who wanted it debated now were not deterred by that , and probably a lot of them will not be deterred by the agreement announced today . I think that we must they have the perfect right to do this . But the timing of this whole issue was clearly forced by the people in the Senate who were opposed to any change of the policy no matter what the facts are . And I think that was their right to do , but they control the timing of this , not me . That is my position . My position is that I still embrace the principle , and I think it should be done . The position of those who are opposed to me is that they think that the problems will be so overwhelming everybody with good sense will change their position . I do not expect to do that . I do not expect to change my position , no . For one thing , I think if you look at the last 10 years of experience here , according to the reports we have , this country spent 500 million in tax dollars to separate something under 16 , 500 homosexuals from the service and has dealt with complaints , at least , of sexual abuse , heterosexual abuse , largely against women , far greater volumes . But during this period , we have plainly had the best educated , best trained , most cohesive military force in the history of the United States . And everybody , ask anybody , and the Joint Chiefs will tell you that . They agreed that we should stop asking the question . This single thing that is dividing people on this debate , I want to make it very clear that this is a very narrow issue . It is whether a person , in the absence of any other disqualifying conduct , can simply say that he or she is homosexual and stay in the service . I do not expect that to spark this kind of problem . And I certainly think in the next 6 months , as people start to work it through and talk it through , a lot of legitimate , practical issues will be raised and dealt with in a more rational environment that is less charged . That is certainly what I hope will happen . Thank you .<speech_sep>Thank you very much . I am delighted to see all of you here . I thank Speaker Foley and the Republican leader , Bob Michel , for joining us today . There are so many people to thank , and the Vice President did a marvelous job . I do want to mention , if I might , just three others Laura Tyson , the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Bob Rubin , head of my national economic team and one Republican Member of the House that was not mentioned , Congressman David Dreier , who went with me on a rainy day to Louisiana to campaign for NAFTThere are many others that I might mention , but I thank all of you for what you have done . I also cannot help but note that in spite of all the rest of our efforts , there was that magic moment on Larry King , which made a lot of difference . And I thank the Vice President for that and for so much else . In the campaign , when we decided to come out for NAFThe was a strong supporter of that position in our personal meetings , long before we knew whether we would even be here or not . I also would be remiss if I did not personally thank both Mickey Kantor and Mack McLarty for the work they did , especially in the closing days with the Mexican trade representatives and the Mexican Government . I had also like to web come here the representatives from Mexico and Canada and tell them they are , in fact , welcome here . They are our partners in the future that we are trying to make together . I want to say a special word of thanks to the Cabinet because we have tried to do something that I have not always seen in the past . And we try to get all of our Departments and all of our Cabinet leaders to work together on all the things that we all care about . And a lot of them , therefore , bad to take a lot of personal time and business time away from their very busy schedules to do this . I thank the former leaders of our Government that were mentioned and our military . I cannot help but noting , since General Powell is here , that every senior military officer with whom I spoke about NAFTA was perhaps they were as a group perhaps the most intensely supportive of any group I spoke with . and I think it is because they have in their bones the experience of the world of the last several decades . And they knew we could not afford to turn away from our leadership responsibilities and our constructive involvement in the world . And many of them , of course , still in uniform , were not permitted to say that in public and should not have been . But I think I can say that today I was profoundly personally moved by the remarks that they made . I do want to say , also , a special word of thanks to all the citizens who helped us , the business leaders , the labor folks , the environmental people who came out and worked through this many of them at great criticism , particularly in the environmental movement and some of the working people who helped it . And a group that was quite pivotal to our success that I want to acknowledge specifically are the small business people , many of whom got themselves organized and came forward and tried to help us . They made a real difference . And they have been mentioned , but I could not let this moment go by without thanking my good friend Bill Daley and Congressman Bill Frenzel for their work in helping to mobilize this effort . Congressman Frenzel wrote me a great letter the other day and sent me one of his famous doodles that he doodled around the NAFTA legislation , which I am now having framed . But they sort of represented the bipartisan spirit that encaptured the Congress , encaptured the country in the cause to change . I hope that we can have more than that in the days and months and years ahead . It was a very fine thing . This whole issue turned out to be a defining moment for our Nation . I spoke with one of the folks who was in the reception just a few moments ago who told me that he was in China watching the vote on international television when it was taken . And be said you would have had to be there to understand how important this was to the rest of the world , not because of the terms of NAFTwhich basically is a trade agreement between the United States , Mexico , and Canada , but because it became a symbolic struggle for the spirit of our country and for how we would approach this very difficult and rapidly changing world dealing with our own considerable challenges here at home . I believe we have made a decision now that will permit us to create an economic order in the world that will promote more growth , more equality , better preservation of the environment , and a greater possibility of world peace . We are on the verge of a global economic expansion that is sparked by the fact that the United States lit this critical moment decided that we would compete , not retreat . In a few moments , I will sign the North American free trade act into law . NAFTA will tear clown trade barriers between our three nations . It will create the world s largest trade zone and create 200 , 000 jobs in this country by 1995 alone . The environmental and labor side agreements negotiated by our administration will make this agreement a force for social progress as well as economic growth . Already the confidence we have displayed by ratifying NAFTA has begun to bear fruit . We are now making real progress toward a worldwide trade agreement so significant that it could make the material gains of NAFTA for our country look small by comparison . Today we have the chance to do what our parents did before us . We have the opportunity to remake the world . For this new era , our national security we now know will be determined as much by our ability to pull down foreign trade barriers as by our ability to breach distant ramparts . Once again , we are leading . And in so doing , we are rediscovering a fundamental truth about ourselves When we lead , we build security , we build prosperity for our own people . We have learned this lesson the hard way . Twice before in this century , we have been forced to define our role in the world . After World War I we turned inward , building walls of protectionism around our Nation . The result was a Great Depression and ultimately another horrible World War . After the Second World War , we took a different course We reached outward . Gifted leaders of both political parties built a new order based on collective security and expanded trade . They created a foundation of stability and created in the process the conditions which led to the explosion of the great American middle class , one of the true economic miracles In the whole history of civilization . Their statecraft stands to this day the IMF and the World Bank , GATand NATO . In this very auditorium in 1949 , President Harry Truman signed one of the charter documents of this golden era of American leadership , the North Atlantic Treaty that created NAT In this pact we hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression , told his audience , a bulwark which will permit us to get on with the real business of Government and society , the business of achieving a fuller and happier life for our citizens . Now , the institutions built by Truman and Acheson , by Marshall and Vandenberg , have accomplished their task . The cold war is over . The grim certitude of the contest with communism has been replaced by the exuberant uncertainty of international economic competition . And the great question of this day is how to ensure security for our people at a time when change is the only constant . Make no mistake , the global economy with all of its promise and perils is now the central fact of life for hard working Americans . It has enriched the lives of millions of Americans . But for too many those same winds of change have worn away at file basis of their security . For two decades , most people have worked harder for less . Seemingly secure jobs have been lost . And while America once again is the most productive nation on Earth , this productivity itself holds the seeds of further insecurity . After all , productivity means the same people can produce more or , very often , that fewer people can produce more . This is the world we face . We cannot stop global change . We cannot repeal the international economic competition that is everywhere . We can only harness the energy to our benefit . Now we must recognize that the only way for a wealthy nation to grow richer is to export , to simply find new customers for the products and services it makes . That , my fellow Americans , is the decision the Congress made when they voted to ratify NAFTA . I am gratified with the work that Congress has done this year , bringing the deficit down and keeping interest rates down , getting housing starts and new jobs going upward . But we know that over the long rim , our ability to have our internal economic policies work for the benefit of our people requires us to have external economic policies that permit productivity to find expression not simply in higher incomes for our businesses but in more jobs and higher incomes for our people . That means more customers . There is no other way , not for the United States or for Europe or for Japan or for any other wealthy nation in the world . That is why I am gratified that we had such a good meeting after the NAFTA vote in the House with the Asian Pacific leaders in Washington . I am gratified that , as Vice President Gore and Chief of Staff Mack McLarty announced 2 weeks ago when they met with President Salinas , next year the nations of this hemisphere will gather in an economic summit that will plan how to extend the benefits of trade to the emerging market democracies of all the Americas . And now I am pleased that we have the opportunity to secure the biggest breakthrough of all . Negotiators from 112 nations are seeking to conclude negotiations on a new round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade a historic world , de trade pact , one that would spur a global economic boon , is now within our grasp . Let me be clear . We cannot , nor should we , settle for a bad GATT agreement . But we will not flag in our efforts to secure a good one in these closing days . We are prepared to make our contributions to the success of this negotiation , but we insist that other nations do their part as well . We must not squander this opportunity . I call on all the nations of the world to seize this moment and close the deal on a strong GATT agreement within the next week . I say to everyone , even to our negotiators Do not rest . Do not sleep . Close the deal . I told Mickey Kantor the other day that we rewarded his laborious effort on NAFTA with a vacation at the GATT talks . My fellow Americans , bit by bit all these things are creating the conditions of a sustained global expansion . As significant as they are , our goals must be more ambitious . The United States must seek nothing less than a new trading system that benefits all nations through robust commerce but that protects our middle class and gives other nations a chance to grow one , that lifts workers and the environment up without dragging people down , that seeks to ensure that our policies reflect our values . Our agenda must , therefore , be far reaching . We are determining that dynamic trade cannot lead to environmental despoliation . We will seek new institutional arrangements to ensure that trade leaves the world cleaner than before . We will press for workers in all countries to secure rights that we now take for granted , to organize and earn a decent living . We will insist that expanded trade be fair to our businesses and to our regions . No country should use cartels , subsidies , or rules of entry to keep our products off its shelves . And we must see to it that our citizens have the personal security to confidently participate in this new era . Every worker must receive the education and training he or she needs to reap the rewards of international competition rather than to bear its burdens . Next year , our administration will propose comprehensive legislation to transform our unemployment system into a reemployment and job retraining system for the 21st century . And above all , I say to you we must seek to reconstruct the broad based political coalition for expanded trade . For decades , working men and women and their representatives supported policies that brought us prosperity and security . That was because we recognized that expanded trade benefited all of us but that we have an obligation to protect those workers who do bear the brunt of competition by giving them a chance to be retrained and to go on to a new and different and , ultimately , more secure and more rewarding way of work . In recent years , this social contract has been sundered . It cannot continue . When I affix my signature to the NAFTA legislation a few moments from now , I do so with this pledge To the men and women of our country who were afraid of these changes and found in their opposition to NAFTA an expression of that fear what I thought was a wrong expression and what I know was a wrong expression but nonetheless represented legitimate fears the gains from this agreement will be your gains , too . I ask those who opposed NAFTA to work with us to guarantee that the labor and side agreements are enforced , and I call on all of us who believe in NAFTA to join with me to urge the Congress to create the world s best worker training and retraining system . We owe it to the business community as well as to the working men and women of this country . It means greater productivity , lower unemployment , greater worker efficiency , and higher wages and greater security for our people . We have to do that . We seek a new and more open global trading system not for its own sake but for our own sake . Good jobs , rewarding careers , broadened horizons for the middle class Americans can only be secured by expanding exports and global growth . For too long our step has been unsteady as the ground has shifted beneath our feet . Today , as I sign the North American Free Trade Agreement into law and call for further progress on GATI believe we have found our footing . And I ask all of you to be steady , to recognize that there is no turning back from the world of today and tomorrow . We must face the challenges , embrace them with confidence , deal with the problems honestly and openly , and make this world work for all of us . America is where it should be , in the lead , setting the pace , showing the confidence that all of us need to face tomorrow . We are ready to compete , and we can win . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Speaker , Vice President , members of Congress , honored guests , my fellow Americans Tonight , I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union . Let me begin by saluting the new Speaker of the House , and thanking him , especially tonight , for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the gallery with Hastert Lyn Gibson and Wenling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom s house . Speaker , at your swearing in , you asked us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship . Speaker , let us do exactly that . Tonight , I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new jobs , wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation , the highest homeownership in history , the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years , and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957 . For the first time in three decades , the budget is balanced . From a deficit of 290 billion in 1992 , we had a surplus of 70 billion last year . And now we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years . Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you , we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century . America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the Middle East . Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore , we have a government for the information age . Once again , a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good , rooted in our oldest values of opportunity , responsibility , and community devoted to fiscal responsibility determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century a 21st century government for 21st century America . My fellow Americans , I stand before you tonight to report that the state of our Union is strong . Now , America is working again . The promise of our future is limitless . But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency . How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today . So with our budget surplus growing , our economy expanding , our confidence rising , now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century . Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge , the aging of America . With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030 , the baby boom will become a senior boom . So first , and above all , we must save Social Security for the 21st century . Early in this century , being old meant being poor . When President Roosevelt created Social Security , thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called the stark terror of penniless , helpless old age . Even today , without Social Security , half our nation s elderly would be forced into poverty . Today , Social Security is strong . But by 2013 , payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments . By 2032 , the Trust Fund will be exhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefits older Americans have been promised . The best way to keep Social Security a rock solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits , not to raise payroll tax rates , not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it . Instead , I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security . Specifically , I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security , investing a small portion in the private sector , just as any private or state government pension would do . This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years . But we must aim higher . We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years . We should reduce poverty among elderly women , who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other seniors . And we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn . Now , these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices over and above the dedication of the surplus . They must be made on a bipartisan basis . They should be made this year . So let me say to you tonight , I reach out my hand to all of you in both Houses , in both parties , and ask that we join together in saying to the American people We will save Social Security now . Now , last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security . Again , I say , we should not spend any of it , not any of it , until after Social Security is truly saved . First things first . Second , once we have saved Social Security , we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve Medicare . Already , we have extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 10 years , but we should extend it for at least another decade . Tonight , I propose that we use one out of every 6 in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020 . But again , we should aim higher . We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas , including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare Commission . If we work together , we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniors , affordable prescription drugs . Third , we must help all Americans , from their first day on the job to save , to invest , to create wealth . From its beginning , Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings . Yet , today , millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security . Americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever . Therefore , in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare , I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century . I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accounts USA accounts to give all Americans the means to save . With these new accounts Americans can invest as they choose and receive funds to match a portion of their savings , with extra help for those least able to save . USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation s wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement . I ask you to support them . Fourth , we must invest in long term care . I propose a tax credit of 1 , 000 for the aged , ailing or disabled , and the families who care for them . Long term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America , and we must do more to help our families deal with it . I was born in 1946 , the first year of the baby boom . I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren . Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders , and we should take it . Saving Social Security , Medicare , creating USA accounts This is the right way to use the surplus . If we do so if we do so we will still have resources to meet critical needs in education and defense . And I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound . Listen to this If we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16 percent for Medicare , over the next 15 years , that saving will achieve the lowest level of publicly held debt since right before World War in 1917 . So with these four measures saving Social Security , strengthening Medicare , establishing the USA accounts , supporting long term care we can begin to meet our generation s historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors . Now , there are more children from more diverse backgrounds in our public schools than at any time in our history . Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire Nation to thrive in the new economy . Today we can say something we could not say six years ago With tax credits and more affordable student loans , with more work study grants and more Pell Grants , with education IRAs and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than five million Americans will receive this year , we have finally opened the doors of college to all Americans . With our support , nearly every state has set higher academic standards for public schools , and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students . With over 1 billion in discounts available this year , we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet . Last fall , you passed our proposal to start hiring 100 , 000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades . Now I ask you to finish the job . You know , our children are doing better . SAT scores are up math scores have risen in nearly all grades . But there is a problem . While our 4th graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science , our 8th graders are around average , and our 12th graders rank near the bottom . We must do better . Now , each year the national government invests more than 15 billion in our public schools . I believe we must change the way we invest that money , to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work . First , later this year , I will send to Congress a plan that , for the first time , holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results . My Education Accountability Act will require every school district receiving federal help to take the following five steps . First , all schools must end social promotion . No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she cannot read . We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material . But we cannot just hold students back because the system fails them . So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after school programs , to keep a million children learning . Now , if you doubt this will work , just look at Chicago , which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who do not master the basics . Math and reading scores are up three years running with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods . It will work , and we should do it . Second , all states and school districts must turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down . That is the policy established in North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt . North Carolina made the biggest gains in test scores in the nation last year . Our budget includes 200 million to help states turn around their own failing schools . Third , all states and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers . The great majority of our teachers do a fine job . But in too many schools , teachers do not have college majors or even minors in the subjects they teach . New teachers should be required to pass performance exams , and all teachers should know the subjects they are teaching . This year s balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher standards . And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments , I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner cities and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities . Let us bring excellence in every part of America . Fourth , we must empower parents with more information and more choices . In too many communities , it is easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools . Every school district should issue report cards on every school . And parents should be given more choices in selecting their public school . When I became President , there was just one independent public charter school in all America . With our support , on a bipartisan basis , today there are 1 , 100 . My budget assures that early in the next century , there will be 3 , 000 . Fifth , to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years , we should say that all states and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policies . Now , let us do one more thing for our children . Today , too many schools are so old they are falling apart , or so overcrowded students are learning in trailers . Last fall , Congress missed the opportunity to change that . This year , with 53 million children in our schools , Congress must not miss that opportunity again . I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5 , 000 schools . If we do these things end social promotion turn around failing schools build modern ones support qualified teachers promote innovation , competition and discipline then we will begin to meet our generation s historic responsibility to create 21st century schools . Now , we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work . The most basic tool of all is a decent income . So let us raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years . And let us make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws . That was encouraging , you know . There was more balance on the seesaw . I like that . Let us give them a hand . That is great . Working parents also need quality child care . So again this year , I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families , for improved safety and quality , for expanded after school programs . And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay at home parents , too . They need support , as well . Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work . Now , the Family and Medical Leave Act , the very first bill I signed into law , has now , since 1993 , helped millions and millions of Americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs . I think it is time , with all the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers , to extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working for smaller companies . And I hope you will support it . Finally on the matter of work , parents should never have to face discrimination in the workplace . So I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children . That is not right . America s families deserve the world s best medical care . Thanks to bipartisan federal support for medical research , we are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson s to Alzheimer s , to arthritis to cancer . But as we continue our advances in medical science , we cannot let our medical system lag behind . Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America , driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well . I think we ought to say to every American You should have the right to know all your medical options , not just the cheapest . If you need a specialist , you should have a right to see one . You have a right to the nearest emergency care if you are in an accident . These are things that we ought to say . And I think we ought to say You should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment , whether it is a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment , or anything else . I believe this . Now , I have ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare , Medicaid , and other federal health programs . But only Congress can pass a Patients Bill of Rights for all Americans . Now , last year , Congress missed that opportunity , and we must not miss that opportunity again . For the sake of our families , I ask us to join together across party lines and pass a strong , enforceable Patients Bill of Rights . As more of our medical records are stored electronically , the threats to all our privacy increase . Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August , one way or another , we can all say to the American people , We will protect the privacy of medical records , and we will do it this year . Now two years ago , the Congress extended health coverage to up to five million children . Now we should go beyond that . We should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance . We should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare . And we should continue to ensure access to family planning . No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job . And therefore , I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation , proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords , Roth , and Moynihan to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work . We need to enable our public hospitals , our community , our university health centers to provide basic , affordable care for all the millions of working families who do not have any insurance . They do a lot of that today , but much more can be done . And my balanced budget makes a good down payment toward that goal . I hope you will think about them and support that provision . Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness . No American should ever be afraid ever to address this disease . This year , we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health . With sensitivity , commitment , and passion , Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here , and I had like to thank her for what she is done . Thank you . Thank you . As everyone knows , our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes . Now , I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby , to reaffirm the FDA s authority to protect our children from tobacco , and to hold tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers . Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare and other programs . You know , the states have been right about this Taxpayers should not pay for the cost of lung cancer , emphysema , and other smoking related illnesses the tobacco companies should . So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and , with the funds we recover , to strengthen Medicare . Now , if we act in these areas minimum wage , family leave , child care , health care , the safety of our children then we will begin to meet our generation s historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the 21st century . Today , America is the most dynamic , competitive , job creating economy in history . But we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embraces all Americans . Today s income gap is largely a skills gap . Last year , the Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need . And I applaud all of you here who were part of that . This year , I recommend a five year commitment to the new system so that we can provide , over the next five years , appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close . I hope you will support this . Also , I ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for adult literacy , to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth grade level . We need to do this . Here s some good news In the past six years , we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half . You can all be proud of that . Two years ago , from this podium , I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare . Tonight , our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10 , 000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people . And our balanced budget will help another 200 , 000 people move to the dignity and pride of work . I hope you will support it . We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America , to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American communities , with more support for community development banks , for empowerment zones , for 100 , 000 more vouchers for affordable housing . And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to 15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas with tax credits , loan guarantees , including the new American Private Investment Company , modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Company . For years and years and years , we have had this OPIthis Overseas Private Investment Corporation , because we knew we had untapped markets overseas . But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas they are right here at home . And we should go after them . We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm . As this Congress knows very well , dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farms . Last year , the Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture . And I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance . I ask you to join with me and do this . This should not be a political issue . Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural America today , and we need an appropriate means to address it . We must strengthen our lead in technology . It was government investment that led to the creation of the Internet . I propose a 28 percent increase in long term computing research . We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment , by solving the so called Y2K computer problem . We had one member of Congress stand up and applaud . And we may have about that ratio out there applauding at home , in front of their television sets . But remember , this is a big , big problem . And we have been working hard on it . Already , we have made sure that the Social Security checks will come on time . But I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every state and local government , every business , large and small , to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century , not the first crisis of the 21st . For our own prosperity , we must support economic growth abroad . You know , until recently , a third of our economic growth came from exports . But over the past year and a half , financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk . Today , much of the world is in recession , with Asia hit especially hard . This is the most serious financial crisis in half a century . To meet it , the United States and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund . And while the turmoil is not over , we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it . At the same time , we have to continue to work on the long term project , building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of Asia . This June I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose , and I ask all of you to support our endeavors . I also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century America . I had like to say something really serious to everyone in this chamber in both parties . I think trade has divided us , and divided Americans outside this chamber , for too long . Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and government can stand together . I believe these are the things we ought to all agree on . So let me try . First , we ought to tear down barriers , open markets , and expand trade . But at the same time , we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade , a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment . We must insist that international trade organizations be more open to public scrutiny , instead of mysterious , secret things subject to wild criticism . When you come right down to it , now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated , we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home . We have got to put a human face on the global economy . We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation . I have already informed the government of Japan that if that nation s sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed , America will respond . We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly 2 billion . I had like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade , based on these principles . And I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the President the trade authority long used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century . Tonight I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global trade negotiations to expand exports of services , manufactures , and farm products . Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world . And this year , we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world . If we do these things invest in our people , our communities , our technology , and lead in the global economy then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America . You know , no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful , more secure , more free . All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland . All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace . And with our NATO allies , we are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo , to bring those responsible to justice , and to give the people of Kosovo the self government they deserve . All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East . Some of you were with me last December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel . Now I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye agreement to protect Israel s security , to stimulate the Palestinian economy , to support our friends in Jordan . We must not we dare not let them down . I hope you will help . As we work for peace , we must also meet threats to our nation s security , including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism . We will defend our security wherever we are threatened , as we did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden s network of terror . The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world . So let us give them the support they need , the safest possible workplaces , and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead . We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks . We must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergenices , to support research into vaccines and treatments . We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles , from Korea to India and Pakistan . We must expand our work with Russia , Ukraine , and other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands . Our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two thirds over the next five years . With Russia , we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals . The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height . It is been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . If we do not do the right thing , other nations will not either . I ask the Senate to take this vital step Approve the treaty now , to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms , and to make sure we can end nuclear testing forever . For nearly a decade , Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them . America will continue to contain Saddam , and we will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people . Now , last month , in our action over Iraq , our troops were superb . Their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required . Captain Jeff Taliaferro , a 10 year veteran of the Air Force , flew a B 1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam s war machine . He is here with us tonight . I had like to ask you to honor him and all the 33 , 000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox . Captain Taliaferro . It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985 . Since April , together we have added nearly 6 billion to maintain our military readiness . My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for readiness , for modernization , and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families . We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community in America by millions of our veterans . America s defenders today still stand ready at a moment s notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many , to do what needs to be done as no one else can . They always come through for America . We must come through for them . The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security . The United Nations plays a crucial role , with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone . America needs a strong and effective I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts . We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia , expanding NATO and defining its new missions , maintaining our alliance with Japan , with Korea , with our other Asian allies , and engaging China . In China , last year , I said to the leaders and the people what I had like to say again tonight Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty . But I had also like to say again to the American people It is important not to isolate China . The more we bring China into the world , the more the world will bring change and freedom to China . Last spring , with some of you , I traveled to Africa , where I saw democracy and reform rising but still held back by violence and disease . We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa , supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria , and passing the African Trade and Development Act . We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean , our common work to educate children , fight drugs , strengthen democracy and increase trade . In this hemisphere , every government but one is freely chosen by its people . We are determined that Cuba , too , will know the blessings of liberty . The American people have opened their hearts and their arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes . Working with Congress , I am committed to help them rebuild . When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region , they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers . In the Dominican Republic , Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans , working side by side . With her was someone else who has been very important to the relief efforts . You know , sports records are made and , sooner or later , they are broken . But making other people s lives better , and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood that lasts forever . So , for far more than baseball , Sammy Sosa , you are a hero in two countries tonight . Thank you . So I say to all of you , if we do these things if we pursue peace , fight terrorism , increase our strength , renew our alliances we will begin to meet our generation s historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century America in a freer , more peaceful world . As the world has changed , so have our own communities . We must make them safer , more livable , and more united . This year , we will reach our goal of 100 , 000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget . The Brady bill has stopped a quarter million felons , fugitives , and stalkers from buying handguns . And now , the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years . Tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer . Our balanced budget will help put up to 50 , 000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools , from crime mapping computers to digital mug shots . We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime . Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment , saying to prisoners If you stay on drugs , you have to stay behind bars and to those on parole If you want to keep your freedom , you must stay free of drugs . I ask Congress to restore the five day waiting period for buying a handgun and extend the Brady bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun . We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities . Last year , every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro , Paducah , Pearl , Edinboro , Springfield . We were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents do not have to live through their loss . After she lost her daughter , Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro , Arkansas , came here to the White House with a powerful plea . She said , Please , please , for the sake of your children , lock up your guns . Do not let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town . It is a message she is passionately advocating every day . Suzann is here with us tonight , with the First Lady . I had like to thank her for her courage and her commitment . Thank you . In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence , I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug Free School Act , to pass legislation to require child trigger locks , to do everything possible to keep our children safe . A century ago , President Theodore Roosevelt defined our great , central task as leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us . Today , we are restoring the Florida Everglades , saving Yellowstone , preserving the red rock canyons of Utah , protecting California s redwoods and our precious coasts . But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded . Last year s heat waves , floods , and storms are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now . Tonight I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollution , and tax incentives and investments to spur clean energy technology . And I want to work with members of Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early , voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases . All our communities face a preservation challenge , as they grow and green space shrinks . Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day . In response , I propose two major initiatives First , a 1 billion livability agenda to help communities save open space , ease traffic congestion , and grow in ways that enhance every citizen s quality of life and second , a 1 billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across America from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park . These are truly landmark initiatives , which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the Vice President , and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here . Now , to get the most out of your community , you have to give something back . That is why we created AmeriCorps , our national service program that gives today s generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college . So far , in just four years , 100 , 000 young Americans have built low income homes with Habitat for Humanity , helped to tutor children with churches , worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters , and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better . I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps . Now , we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st century . Last year the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan and Senators McCain and Feingold . But a partisan minority in the Senate blocked reform . So I had like to say to the House Pass it again , quickly . And I had like to say to the Senate I hope you will say yes to a stronger American democracy in the year 2000 . Since 1997 , our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people . In its report last fall , the initiative s advisory board found that Americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines . We know it is been a long journey . For some , it goes back to before the beginning of our Republic for others , back since the Civil War for others , throughout the 20th century . But for most of us alive today , in a very real sense , this journey began 43 years ago , when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and would not get up . She is sitting down with the First Lady tonight , and she may get up or not , as she chooses . We thank her . Thank you , Rosa . We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated , as the Presidential initiative said , by opportunity gaps . The initiative I have outlined tonight will help to close them . But we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either . Discrimination or violence because of race or religion , ancestry or gender , disability or sexual orientation , is wrong , and it ought to be illegal . Therefore , I ask Congress to make the Employment Non Discrimination Act and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of the land . Now , since every person in America counts , every American ought to be counted . We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do that . Our new immigrants must be part of our One America . After all , they are revitalizing our cities they are energizing our culture they are building up our economy . We have a responsibility to make them welcome here , and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life . That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government . There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that . Therefore , our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility . I hope you will support it . Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower , on slave ships , whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles , whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago , our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America . We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America . You know , barely more than 300 days from now , we will cross that bridge into the new millennium . This is a moment , as the First Lady has said , to honor the past and imagine the future . I had like to take just a minute to honor her . For leading our Millennium Project , for all she is done for our children , for all she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and abroad , I honor her . Last year , I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America s treasures . Hillary has traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison s invention factory or Harriet Tubman s home . Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community . And tonight , before I close , I want to invite every town , every city , every community to become a nationally recognized millennium community , by launching projects that save our history , promote our arts and humanities , prepare our children for the 21st century . Already , the response has been remarkable . And I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to members in Congress of both parties for their support . Just one example Because of you , the Star Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages . In ways large and small , as we look to the millennium we are keeping alive what George Washington called the sacred fire of liberty . Six years ago , I came to office in a time of doubt for America , with our economy troubled , our deficit high , our people divided . Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us . But across this country , in a thousand neighborhoods , I have seen , even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession , the real heart and character of America . I knew then that we Americans could renew this country . Tonight , as I deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century , no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that more perfect Union of our Founders dream . We are now at the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness , overcoming depression , lifting up the disposed , bringing down barriers to racial prejudice , building the largest middle class in history , winning two World Wars and the long twilight struggle of the Cold War . We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebears in this century . Yet , perhaps , in the daily press of events , in the clash of controversy , we do not see our own time for what it truly is , a new dawn for America . A hundred years from tonight , another American President will stand in this place and report on the state of the Union . He or she he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now . So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time but of their time , that we reached as high as our ideals , that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness , that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love . My fellow Americans , this is our moment . Let us lift our eyes as one nation , and from the mountaintop of this American Century , look ahead to the next one , asking God s blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country . Thank you , and good evening .<speech_sep>
