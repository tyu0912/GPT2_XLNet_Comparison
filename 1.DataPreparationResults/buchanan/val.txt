Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Throughout the year since our last meeting the country has been eminently prosperous in all its material interests . The general health has been excellent , our harvests have been abundant , and plenty smiles throughout the laud . Our commerce and manufactures have been prosecuted with energy and industry , and have yielded fair and ample returns . In short , no nation in the tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of greater material prosperity than we have done until within a very recent period . Why is it , then , that discontent now so extensively prevails , and the Union of the States , which is the source of all these blessings , is threatened with destruction The long continued and intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States has at length produced its natural effects . The different sections of the Union are now arrayed against each other , and the time has arrived , so much dreaded by the Father of his Country , when hostile geographical parties have been formed . I have long foreseen and often forewarned my countrymen of the now impending danger . This does not proceed solely from the claim on the part of Congress or the Territorial legislatures to exclude slavery from the Territories , nor from the efforts of different States to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law . All or any of these evils might have been endured by the South without danger to the Union as others have been in the hope that time and reflection might apply the remedy . The immediate peril arises not so much from these causes as from the fact that the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the North for the last quarter of a century has at length produced its malign influence on the slaves and inspired them with vague notions of freedom . Hence a sense of security no longer exists around the family altar . This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile insurrections . Many a matron throughout the South retires at night in dread of what may befall herself and children before the morning . Should this apprehension of domestic danger , whether real or imaginary , extend and intensify itself until it shall pervade the masses of the Southern people , then disunion will become inevitable . Self preservation is the first law of nature , and has been implanted in the heart of man by his Creator for the wisest purpose and no political union , however fraught with blessings and benefits in all other respects , can long continue if the necessary consequence be to render the homes and the firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure . Sooner or later the bonds of such a union must be severed . It is my conviction that this fatal period has not yet arrived , and my prayer to God is that He would preserve the Constitution and the Union throughout all generations . But let us take warning in time and remove the cause of danger . It can not be denied that for five and twenty years the agitation at the North against slavery has been incessant . In 1835 pictorial handbills and inflammatory appeals were circulated extensively throughout the South of a character to excite the passions of the slaves , and , in the language of General Jackson , to stimulate them to insurrection and produce all the horrors of a servile war . This agitation has ever since been continued by the public press , by the proceedings of State and county conventions and by abolition sermons and lectures . The time of Congress has been occupied in violent speeches on this never ending subject , and appeals , in pamphlet and other forms , indorsed by distinguished names , have been sent forth from this central point and spread broadcast over the Union . How easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery question forever and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country They , and they alone , can do it . All that is necessary to accomplish the object , and all for which the slave States have ever contended , is to be let alone and permitted to manage their domestic institutions in their own way . As sovereign States , they , and they alone , are responsible before God and the world for the slavery existing among them . For this the people of the North are not more responsible and have no more fight to interfere than with similar institutions in Russia or in Brazil . Upon their good sense and patriotic forbearance I confess I still greatly rely . Without their aid it is beyond the power of any President , no matter what may be his own political proclivities , to restore peace and harmony among the States . Wisely limited and restrained as is his power under our Constitution and laws , he alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question . And this brings me to observe that the election of any one of our fellow citizens to the office of President does not of itself afford just cause for dissolving the Union . This is more especially true if his election has been effected by a mere plurality , and not a majority of the people , and has resulted from transient and temporary causes , which may probably never again occur . In order to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance , the Federal Government must be guilty of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of powers not granted by the Constitution . The late Presidential election , however , has been held in strict conformity with its express provisions . How , then , can the result justify a revolution to destroy this very Constitution Reason , justice , a regard for the Constitution , all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the President elect before resorting to such a remedy . It is said , however , that the antecedents of the President elect have been sufficient to justify the fears of the South that he will attempt to invade their constitutional rights . But are such apprehensions of contingent danger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noblest system of government ever devised by mortals From the very nature of his office and its high responsibilities he must necessarily be conservative . The stern duty of administering the vast and complicated concerns of this Government affords in itself a guaranty that he will not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional right . After all , he is no more than the chief executive officer of the Government . His province is not to make but to execute the laws . And it is a remarkable fact in our history that , notwithstanding the repeated efforts of the antislavery party , no single act has ever passed Congress , unless we may possibly except the Missouri compromise , impairing in the slightest degree the rights of the South to their property in slaves and it may also be observed , judging from present indications , that no probability exists of the passage of such an act by a majority of both Houses , either in the present or the next Congress . Surely under these circumstances we ought to be restrained from present action by the precept of Him who spake as man never spoke , that sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof . The day of evil may never come unless we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves . It is alleged as one cause for immediate secession that the Southern States are denied equal rights with the other States in the common Territories . But by what authority are these denied Not by Congress , which has never passed , and I believe never will pass , any act to exclude slavery from these Territories and certainly not by the Supreme Court , which has solemnly decided that slaves are property , and , like all other property , their owners have a right to take them into the common Territories and hold them there under the protection of the Constitution . So far then , as Congress is concerned , the objection is not to anything they have already done , but to what they may do hereafter . It will surely be admitted that this apprehension of future danger is no good reason for an immediate dissolution of the Union . It is true that the Territorial legislature of Kansas , on the 23d February , 1860 , passed in great haste an act over the veto of the governor declaring that slavery is and shall be forever prohibited in this Territory . Such an act , however , plainly violating the rights of property secured by the Constitution , will surely be declared void by the judiciary whenever it shall be presented in a legal form . Only three days after my inauguration the Supreme Court of the United States solemnly adjudged that this power did not exist in a Territorial legislature . Yet such has been the factious temper of the times that the correctness of this decision has been extensively impugned before the people , and the question has given rise to angry political conflicts throughout the country . Those who have appealed from this judgment of our highest constitutional tribunal to popular assemblies would , if they could , invest a Territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred rights of property . This power Congress is expressly forbidden by the Federal Constitution to exercise . Every State legislature in the Union is forbidden by its own constitution to exercise it . It can not be exercised in any State except by the people in their highest sovereign capacity , when framing or amending their State constitution . In like manner it can only be exercised by the people of a Territory represented in a convention of delegates for the purpose of framing a constitution preparatory to admission as a State into the Union . Then , and not until then , are they invested with power to decide the question whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits . This is an act of sovereign authority , and not of subordinate Territorial legislation . Were it otherwise , then indeed would the equality of the States in the Territories be destroyed , and the rights of property in slaves would depend not upon the guaranties of the Constitution , but upon the shifting majorities of an irresponsible Territorial legislature . Such a doctrine , from its intrinsic unsoundness , can not long influence any considerable portion of our people , much less can it afford a good reason for a dissolution of the Union . The most palpable violations of constitutional duty which have yet been committed consist in the acts of different State legislatures to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law . It ought to be remembered , however , that for these acts neither Congress nor any President can justly be held responsible . Having been passed in violation of the Federal Constitution , they are therefore null and void . All the courts , both State and national , before whom the question has arisen have from the beginning declared the fugitive slave law to be constitutional . The single exception is that of a State court in Wisconsin , and this has not only been reversed by the proper appellate tribunal , but has met with such universal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a precedent . The validity of this law has been established over and over again by the Supreme Court of the United States with perfect unanimity . It is rounded upon an express provision of the Constitution , requiring that fugitive slaves who escape from service in one State to another shall be delivered up to their masters . Without this provision it is a well known historical fact that the Constitution itself could never have been adopted by the Convention . In one form or other , under the acts of 1793 and 1850 , both being substantially the same , the fugitive slave law has been the law of the land from the days of Washington until the present moment . Here , then , a clear case is presented in which it will be the duty of the next President , as it has been my own , to act with vigor in executing this supreme law against the conflicting enactments of State legislatures . Should he fail in the performance of this high duty , he will then have manifested a disregard of the Constitution and laws , to the great injury of the people of nearly one half of the States of the Union . But are we to presume in advance that he will thus violate his duty This would be at war with every principle of justice and of Christian charity . Let us wait for the overt act . The fugitive slave law has been carried into execution in every contested case since the commencement of the present Administration , though Often , it is to be regretted , with great loss and inconvenience to the master and with considerable expense to the Government . Let us trust that the State legislatures will repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments . Unless this shall be done without unnecessary delay , it is impossible for any human power to save the Union . The Southern States , standing on the basis of the Constitution , have right to demand this act of justice from the States of the North . Should it be refused , then the Constitution , to which all the States are parties , will have been willfully violated by one portion of them in a provision essential to the domestic security and happiness of the remainder . In that event the injured States , after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress , would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union . I have purposely confined my remarks to revolutionary resistance , because it has been claimed within the last few years that any State , whenever this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure , may secede from the Union in accordance with the Constitution and without any violation of the constitutional rights of the other members of the Confederacy that as each became parties to the Union by the vote of its own people assembled in convention , so any one of them may retire from the Union in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention . In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy , it must be on the principle that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary association of States , to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties . If this be so , the Confederacy is a rope of sand , to be penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the States . In this manner our thirty three States may resolve themselves into as many petty , jarring , and hostile republics , each one retiring from the Union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course . By this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks which cost our forefathers many years of toil , privation , and blood to establish . Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the Federal Constitution . After it was framed with the greatest deliberation and care it was submitted to conventions of the people of the several States for ratification . Its provisions were discussed at length in these bodies , composed of the first men of the country . Its opponents contended that it conferred powers upon the Federal Government dangerous to the rights of the States , whilst its advocates maintained that under a fair construction of the instrument there was no foundation for such apprehensions . In that mighty struggle between the first intellects of this or any other country it never occurred to any individual , either among its opponents or advocates , to assert or even to intimate that their efforts were all vain labor , because the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved she might secede from the Union . What a crushing argument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the rights of the States would be endangered by the Constitution The truth is that it was not until many years after the origin of the Federal Government that such a proposition was first advanced . It was then met and refuted by the conclusive arguments of General Jackson , who in his message of the 16th of January , 1833 , transmitting the nullifying ordinance of South Carolina to Congress , employs the following language The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other States from their most solemn obligations , and hazard the liberties and happiness of the millions composing this Union , can not be acknowledged . Such authority is believed to be utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which the General Government is constituted and to the objects which it is expressly formed to attain . It is not pretended that any clause in the Constitution gives countenance to such a theory . It is altogether rounded upon inference not from any language contained in the instrument itself , but from the sovereign character of the several States by which it was ratified . But is it beyond the power of a State , like an individual , to yield a portion of its sovereign rights to secure the remainder In the language of Madison , who has been called the father of the Constitution It was formed by the States that is , by the people in each of the States acting in their highest sovereign capacity , and formed , consequently , by the same authority which formed the State constitutions . Nor is the Government of the United States , created by the Constitution , less a government , in the strict sense of the term , within the sphere of its powers than the governments created by the constitutions of the States are within their several spheres . It is , like them , organized into legislative , executive , and judiciary departments . It operates , like them directly on persons and things , and , like them , it has at command a physical force for executing the powers committed to it . It was intended to be perpetual , and not to be annulled at the pleasure of any one of the contracting parties . The old Articles of Confederation were entitled Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States , and by the thirteenth article it is expressly declared that the articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State , and the Union shall be perpetual . The preamble to the Constitution of the United States , having express reference to the Articles of Confederation , recites that it was established in order to form a more perfect union . And yet it is contended that this more perfect union does not include the essential attribute of perpetuity . But that the Union was designed to be perpetual appears conclusively from the nature and extent of the powers conferred by the Constitution on the Federal Government . These powers embrace the very highest attributes of national sovereignty . They place both the sword and the purse under its control . Congress has power to make war and to make peace , to raise and support armies and navies , and to conclude treaties with foreign governments . It is invested with the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof , and to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States . It is not necessary to enumerate the other high powers which have been conferred upon the Federal Government . In order to carry the enumerated powers into effect , Congress possesses the exclusive right to lay and collect duties on imports , and , in common with the States , to lay and collect all other taxes . But the Constitution has not only conferred these high powers upon Congress , but it has adopted effectual means to restrain the States from interfering with their exercise . For that purpose it has in strong prohibitory language expressly declared that No State shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal coin money emit bills of credit make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts . Moreover No State shall without the consent of the Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws . And if they exceed this amount the excess shall belong , to the United States . And No State shall without the consent of Congress lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another State or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay . In order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high powers against State interposition , it is provided that This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land , and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . The solemn sanction of religion has been superadded to the obligations of official duty , and all Senators and Representatives of the United States , all members of State legislatures , and all executive and judicial officers , both of the United States and of the several States , shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution . In order to carry into effect these powers , the Constitution has established a perfect Government in all its forms legislative , executive , and judicial and this Government to the extent of its powers acts directly upon the individual citizens of every State , and executes its own decrees by the agency of its own officers . In this respect it differs entirely from the Government under the old Confederation , which was confined to making requisitions on the States in their sovereign character . This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse , and they often declined to comply with such requisitions . It thus became necessary for the purpose of removing this barrier and in order to form a more perfect union to establish a Government which could act directly upon the people and execute its own laws without the intermediate agency of the States . This has been accomplished by the Constitution of the United States . In short , the Government created by the Constitution , and deriving its authority from the sovereign people of each of the several States , has precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these States in in the enumerated cases that each one of them possesses over subjects not delegated to the United States , but reserved to the States respectively or to the people . To the extent of the delegated powers the Constitution of the United States is as much a part of the constitution of each State and is as binding upon its people as though it had been textually inserted therein . This Government , therefore , is a great and powerful Government , invested with all the attributes of sovereignty over the special subjects to which its authority extends . Its framers never intended to implant in its bosom the seeds of its own destruction , nor were they at its creation guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution . It was not intended by its framers to be the baseless fabric of a vision , which at the touch of the enchanter would vanish into thin air , but a substantial and mighty fabric , capable of resisting the slow decay of time and of defying the storms of ages . Indeed , well may the jealous patriots of that day have indulged fears that a Government of such high powers might violate the reserved rights of the States , and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construction of these powers to prevent the danger . But they did not fear , nor had they any reason to imagine , that the Constitution would ever be so interpreted as to enable any State by her own act , and without the consent of her sister States , to discharge her people from all or any of their federal obligations . It may be asked , then , Are the people of the States without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the Federal Government By no means . The right of resistance on the part of the governed against the oppression of their governments can not be denied . It exists independently of all constitutions , and has been exercised at all periods of the world s history . Under it old governments have been destroyed and new ones have taken their place . It is embodied in strong and express language in our own Declaration of Independence . But the distinction must ever be observed that this is revolution against an established government , and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right . In short , let us look the danger fairly in the face . Secession is neither more nor less than revolution . It may or it may not be a justifiable revolution , but still it is revolution . What , in the meantime , is the responsibility and true position of the Executive He is bound by solemn oath , before God and the country , to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and from this obligation he can not be absolved by any human power . But what if the performance of this duty , in whole or in part , has been rendered impracticable by events over which he could have exercised no control Such at the present moment is the case throughout the State of South Carolina so far as the laws of the United States to secure the administration of justice by means of the Federal judiciary are concerned . All the Federal officers within its limits through whose agency alone these laws can be carried into execution have already resigned . We no longer have a district judge , a district attorney , or a marshal in South Carolina . In fact , the whole machinery of the Federal Government necessary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people has been demolished , and it would be difficult , if not impossible , to replace it . The only acts of Congress on the statute book bearing upon this subject are those of February 28 , 1795 , and March 3 , 1807 . These authorize the President , after he shall have ascertained that the marshal , with his posse comitatus , is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case , to call forth the militia and employ the Army and Navy to aid him in performing this service , having first by proclamation commanded the insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time This duty can not by possibility be performed in a State where no judicial authority exists to issue process , and where there is no marshal to execute it , and where , even if there were such an officer , the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him . The bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they are without further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single State , not to speak of other States who may place themselves in a similar attitude . Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can or can not be amended so as to carry out more effectually the objects of the Constitution . The same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way of executing the laws for the collection of the customs . The revenue still continues to be collected as heretofore at the custom house in Charleston , and should the collector unfortunately resign a successor may be appointed to perform this duty . Then , in regard to the property of the United States in South Carolina . This has been purchased for a fair equivalent , by the consent of the legislature of the State , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , etc . , and over these the authority to exercise exclusive legislation has been expressly granted by the Constitution to Congress . It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the United States from this property by force but if in this I should prove to be mistaken , the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive . In such a contingency the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants . Apart from the execution of the laws , so far as this may be practicable , the Executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the Federal Government and South Carolina . He has been invested with no such discretion . He possesses no power to change the relations heretofore existing between them , much less to acknowledge the independence of that State . This would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power of recognizing the dissolution of the confederacy among our thirty three sovereign States . It bears no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign de facto government , involving no such responsibility . Any attempt to do this would , on his part , be a naked act of usurpation . It is therefore my duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all its beatings . The course of events is so rapidly hastening forward that the emergency may soon arise when you may be called upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union . I should feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to express an opinion on this important subject . The question fairly stated is , Has the Constitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw or has actually withdrawn from the Confederacy If answered in the affirmative , it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and to make war against a State . After much serious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other department of the Federal Government . It is manifest upon an inspection of the Constitution that this is not among the specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress , and it is equally apparent that its exercise is not necessary and proper for carrying into execution any one of these powers . So far from this power having been delegated to Congress , it was expressly refused by the Convention which framed the Constitution . It appears from the proceedings of that body that on the 31st May , 1787 , the clause authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole against a delinquent State came up for consideration . Madison opposed it in a brief but powerful speech , from which I shall extract but a single sentence . He observed The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment , and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound . Upon his motion the clause was unanimously postponed , and was never , I believe , again presented . Soon afterwards , on the 8th June , 1787 , when incidentally adverting to the subject , he said Any government for the United States formed on the supposed practicability of using force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the States would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of Congress , evidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confederation . Without descending to particulars , it may be safely asserted that the power to make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the Constitution . Suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a State how are we to govern it afterwards Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power In the nature of things , we could not by physical force control the will of the people and compel them to elect Senators and Representatives to Congress and to perform all the other duties depending upon their own volition and required from the free citizens of a free State as a constituent member of the Confederacy . But if we possessed this power , would it be wise to exercise it under existing circumstances The object would doubtless be to preserve the Union . War would not only present the most effectual means of destroying it , but would vanish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction . Besides , in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expended , rendering future reconciliation between the States impossible . In the meantime , who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence The fact is that our Union rests upon public opinion , and can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war . If it can not live in the affections of the people , it must one day perish . Congress possesses many means of preserving it by conciliation , but the sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by force . But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began It has been consecrated by the blood of our fathers , by the glories of the past , and by the hopes of the future . The Union has already made us the most prosperous , and ere long will , if preserved , render us the most powerful , nation on the face of the earth . In every foreign region of the globe the title of American citizen is held in the highest respect , and when pronounced in a foreign land it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest pride . Surely when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss we shall recoil with horror from the last fatal plunge . By such a dread catastrophe the hopes of the friends of freedom throughout the world would be destroyed , and a long night of leaden despotism would enshroud the nations . Our example for more than eighty years would not only be lost , but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for self government . It is not every wrong nay , it is not every grievous wrong which can justify a resort to such a fearful alternative . This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people , after every other constitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted . We should reflect that under this free Government there is an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion . The slavery question , like everything human , will have its day . I firmly believe that it has reached and passed the culminating point . But if in the midst of the existing excitement the Union shall perish , the evil may then become irreparable . Congress can contribute much to avert it by proposing and recommending to the legislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils which the Constitution has itself provided for its own preservation . This has been tried at different critical periods of our history , and always with eminent success . It is to be found in the fifth article , providing for its own amendment . Under this article amendments have been proposed by two thirds of both Houses of Congress , and have been ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several States , and have consequently become parts of the Constitution . To this process the country is indebted for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or of the right of petition . To this we are also indebted for the bill of rights which secures the people against any abuse of power by the Federal Government . Such were the apprehensions justly entertained by the friends of State rights at that period as to have rendered it extremely doubtful whether the Constitution could have long survived without those amendments . Again the Constitution was amended by the same process , after the election of President Jefferson by the House of Representatives , in February , 1803 . This amendment was rendered necessary to prevent a recurrence of the dangers which had seriously threatened the existence of the Government during the pendency of that election . The article for its own amendment was intended to secure the amicable adjustment of conflicting constitutional questions like the present which might arise between the governments of the States and that of the United States . This appears from contemporaneous history . In this connection I shall merely call attention to a few sentences in Madison s justly celebrated report , in 1799 , to the legislature of Virginia . In this he ably and conclusively defended the resolutions of the preceding legislature against the strictures of several other State legislatures . These were mainly rounded upon the protest of the Virginia legislature against the alien and sedition acts , as palpable and alarming infractions of the Constitution . In pointing out the peaceful and constitutional remedies and he referred to none other to which the States were authorized to resort on such occasions , he concludes by saying that The legislatures of the States might have made a direct representation to Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive acts , or they might have represented to their respective Senators in Congress their wish that two thirds thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the Constitution or two thirds of themselves , if such had been their option , might by an application to Congress have obtained a convention for the same object . This is the very course which I earnestly recommend in order to obtain an explanatory amendment of the Constitution on the subject of slavery . This might originate with Congress or the State legislatures , as may be deemed most advisable to attain the object . The explanatory amendment might be confined to the final settlement of the true construction of the Constitution on three special points 1 . An express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the States where it now exists or may hereafter exist . 2 . The duty of protecting this right in all the common Territories throughout their Territorial existence , and until they shall be admitted as States into the Union , with or without slavery , as their constitutions may prescribe . 3 . A like recognition of the right of the master to have his slave who has escaped from one State to another restored and delivered up to him , and of the validity of the fugitive slave law enacted for this purpose , together with a declaration that all State laws impairing or defeating this right are violations of the Constitution , and are consequently null and void . It may be objected that this construction of the Constitution has already been settled by the Supreme Court of the United States , and what more ought to be required The answer is that a very large proportion of the people of the United States still contest the correctness of this decision , and never will cease from agitation and admit its binding force until clearly established by the people of the several States in their sovereign character . Such an explanatory amendment would , it is believed , forever terminate the existing dissensions , and restore peace and harmony among the States . It ought not to be doubted that such an appeal to the arbitrament established by the Constitution itself would be received with favor by all the States of the Confederacy . In any event , it ought to be tried in a spirit of conciliation before any of these States shall separate themselves from the Union . When I entered upon the duties of the Presidential office , the aspect neither of our foreign nor domestic affairs was at all satisfactory . We were involved in dangerous complications with several nations , and two of our Territories were in a state of revolution against the Government . A restoration of the African slave trade had numerous and powerful advocates . Unlawful military expeditions were countenanced by many of our citizens , and were suffered , in defiance of the efforts of the Government , to escape from our shores for the purpose of making war upon the offending people of neighboring republics with whom we were at peace . In addition to these and other difficulties , we experienced a revulsion in monetary affairs soon after my advent to power of unexampled severity and of ruinous consequences to all the great interests of the country . When we take a retrospect of what was then our condition and contrast this with its material prosperity at the time of the late Presidential election , we have abundant reason to return our grateful thanks to that merciful Providence which has never forsaken us as a nation in all our past trials . Our relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character . Since the commencement of my Administration the two dangerous questions arising from the Clayton and Bulwer treaty and from the right of search claimed by the British Government have been amicably and honorably adjusted . The discordant constructions of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty between the two Governments , which at different periods of the discussion bore a threatening aspect , have resulted in a final settlement entirely satisfactory to this Government . In my last annual message I informed Congress that the British Government had not then completed treaty arrangements with the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the two Governments . It is , nevertheless , confidently expected that this good work will ere long be accomplished . This confident expectation has since been fulfilled . Her Britannic Majesty concluded a treaty with Honduras on the 28th November , 1859 , and with Nicaragua on the 28th August , 1860 , relinquishing the Mosquito protectorate . Besides , by the former the Bay Islands are recognized as a part of the Republic of Honduras . It may be observed that the stipulations of these treaties conform in every important particular to the amendments adopted by the Senate of the United States to the treaty concluded at London on the 17th October , 1856 , between the two Governments . It will be recollected that this treaty was rejected by the British Government because of its objection to the just and important amendment of the Senate to the article relating to Ruatan and the other islands in the Bay of Honduras . It must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all classes of our fellow citizens , and especially to those engaged in foreign commerce , that the claim on the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit and search American merchant vessels on the high seas in time of peace has been abandoned . This was by far the most dangerous question to the peace of the two countries which has existed since the War of 1812 . Whilst it remained open they might at any moment have been precipitated into a war . This was rendered manifest by the exasperated state of public feeling throughout our entire country produced by the forcible search of American merchant vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Cuba in the spring of 1858 . The American people hailed with general acclaim the orders of the Secretary of the Navy to our naval force in the Gulf of Mexico to protect all vessels of the United States on the high seas from search or detention by the vessels of war of any other nation . These orders might have produced an immediate collision between the naval forces of the two countries . This was most fortunately prevented by an appeal to the justice of Great Britain and to the law of nations as expounded by her own most eminent jurists . The only question of any importance which still remains open is the disputed title between the two Governments to the island of San Juan , in the vicinity of Washington Territory . As this question is still under negotiation , it is not deemed advisable at the present moment to make any other allusion to the subject . The recent visit of the Prince of Wales , in a private character , to the people of this country has proved to be a most auspicious event . In its consequences it can not fail to increase the kindred and kindly feelings which I trust may ever actuate the Government and people of both countries in their political and social intercourse with each other . With France , our ancient and powerful ally , our relations continue to be of the most friendly character . A decision has recently been made by a French judicial tribunal , with the approbation of the Imperial Government , which can not fail to foster the sentiments of mutual regard that have so long existed between the two countries . Under the French law no person can serve in the armies of France unless he be a French citizen . The law of France recognizing the natural right of expatriation , it follows as a necessary consequence that a Frenchman by the fact of having become a citizen of the United States has changed his allegiance and has lost his native character . He can not therefore be compelled to serve in the French armies in case he should return to his native country . These principles were announced in 1852 by the French minister of war and in two late cases have been confirmed by the French judiciary . In these , two natives of France have been discharged from the French army because they had become American citizens . To employ the language of our present minister to France , who has rendered good service on this occasion . I do not think our French naturalized fellow citizens will hereafter experience much annoyance on this subject . I venture to predict that the time is not far distant when the other continental powers will adopt the same wise and just policy which has done so much honor to the enlightened Government of the Emperor . In any event , our Government is bound to protect the rights of our naturalized citizens everywhere to the same extent as though they had drawn their first breath in this country . We can recognize no distinction between our native and naturalized citizens . Between the great Empire of Russia and the United States the mutual friendship and regard which has so long existed still continues to prevail , and if possible to increase . Indeed , our relations with that Empire are all that we could desire . Our relations with Spain are now of a more complicated , though less dangerous , character than they have been for many years . Our citizens have long held and continue to hold numerous claims against the Spanish Government . These had been ably urged for a series of years by our successive diplomatic representatives at Madrid , but without obtaining redress . The Spanish Government finally agreed to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claims , and on the 5th day of March , 1860 , concluded a convention for this purpose with our present minister at Madrid . Under this convention what have been denominated the Cuban claims , amounting to 128 , 635 . 54 , in which more than 100 of our fellow citizens are interested , were recognized , and the Spanish Government agreed to pay 100 , 000 of this amount within three months following the exchange of ratifications . The payment of the remaining 28 , 635 . 54 was to await the decision of the commissioners for or against the Amistad claim but in any event the balance was to be paid to the claimants either by Spain or the United States . These terms , I have every reason to know , are highly satisfactory to the holders of the Cuban claims . Indeed , they have made a formal offer authorizing the State Department to settle these claims and to deduct the amount of the Amistad claim from the sums which they are entitled to receive from Spain . This offer , of course , can not be accepted . All other claims of citizens of the United States against Spain , or the subjects of the Queen of Spain against the United States , including the Amistad claim , were by this convention referred to a board of commissioners in the usual form . Neither the validity of the Amistad claim nor of any other claim against either party , with the single exception of the Cuban claims , was recognized by the convention . Indeed , the Spanish Government did not insist that the validity of the Amistad claim should be thus recognized , notwithstanding its payment had been recommended to Congress by two of my predecessors , as well as by myself , and an appropriation for that purpose had passed the Senate of the United States . They were content that it should be submitted to the board for examination and decision like the other claims . Both Governments were bound respectively to pay the amounts awarded to the several claimants at such times and places as may be fixed by and according to the tenor of said awards . I transmitted this convention to the Senate for their constitutional action on the 3d of May , 1860 , and on the 27th of the succeeding June they determined that they would not advise and consent to its ratification . These proceedings place our relations with Spain in an awkward and embarrassing position . It is more than probable that the final adjustment of these claims will devolve upon my successor . I reiterate the recommendation contained in my annual message of December , 1858 , and repeated in that of December , 1859 , in favor of the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase . I firmly believe that such an acquisition would contribute essentially to the well being and prosperity of both countries in all future time , as well as prove the certain means of immediately abolishing the African slave trade throughout the world . I would not repeat this recommendation upon the present occasion if I believed that the transfer of Cuba to the United States upon conditions highly favorable to Spain could justly tarnish the national honor of the proud and ancient Spanish monarchy . Surely no person ever attributed to the first Napoleon a disregard of the national honor of France for transferring Louisiana to the United States for a fair equivalent , both in money and commercial advantages . With the Emperor of Austria and the remaining continental powers of Europe , including that of the Sultan , our relations continue to be of the most friendly character . The friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the Government of the United States toward the Empire of China has produced the most satisfactory results . The treaty of Tien tsin of the 18th June , 1858 , has been faithfully observed by the Chinese authorities . The convention of the 8th November , 1858 , supplementary to this treaty , for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claims of our citizens on China referred to in my last annual message , has been already carried into effect so far as this was practicable . Under this convention the sum of 500 , 000 taels , equal to about 700 , 000 , was stipulated to be paid in satisfaction of the claims of American citizens out of the one fifth of the receipts for tonnage , import , and export duties on American vessels at the ports of Canton , Shanghai , and Fuchau , and it was agreed that this amount shall be in full liquidation of all claims of American citizens at the various ports to this date . Debentures for this amount , to wit , 300 , 000 taels for Canton , 100 , 000 for Shanghai , and 100 , 000 for Fuchau , were delivered , according to the terms of the convention , by the respective Chinese collectors of the customs of these ports to the agent selected by our minister to receive the same . Since that time the claims of our citizens have been adjusted by the board of commissioners appointed for that purpose under the act of March 3 , 1859 , and their awards , which proved satisfactory to the claimants , have been approved by our minister . In the aggregate they amount to the sum of 498 , 694 . 78 . The claimants have already received a large proportion of the sums awarded to them out of the fund provided , and it is confidently expected that the remainder will ere long be entirely paid . After the awards shall have been satisfied there will remain a surplus of more than 200 , 000 at the disposition of Congress . As this will , in equity , belong to the Chinese Government , would not justice require its appropriation to some benevolent object in which the Chinese may be specially interested Our minister to China , in obedience to his instructions , has remained perfectly neutral in the war between Great Britain and France and the Chinese Empire , although , in conjunction with the Russian minister , he was ever ready and willing , had the opportunity offered , to employ his good offices in restoring peace between the parties . It is but an act of simple justice , both to our present minister and his predecessor , to state that they have proved fully equal to the delicate , trying , and responsible positions in which they have on different occasions been placed . The ratifications of the treaty with Japan concluded at Yeddo on the 29th July , 1858 , were exchanged at Washington on the 22d May last , and the treaty itself was proclaimed on the succeeding day . There is good reason to expect that under its protection and influence our trade and intercourse with that distant and interesting people will rapidly increase . The ratifications of the treaty were exchanged with unusual solemnity . For this purpose the Tycoon had accredited three of his most distinguished subjects as envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary , who were received and treated with marked distinction and kindness , both by the Government and people of the United States . There is every reason to believe that they have returned to their native land entirely satisfied with their visit and inspired by the most friendly feelings for our country . Let us ardently hope , in the language of the treaty itself , that there shall henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship between the United States of America and His Majesty the Tycoon of Japan and his successors . With the wise , conservative , and liberal Government of the Empire of Brazil our relations continue to be of the most amicable character . The exchange of the ratifications of the convention with the Republic of New Granada signed at Washington on the 10th of September , 1857 , has been long delayed from accidental causes for which neither party is censurable . These ratifications were duly exchanged in this city on the 5th of November last . Thus has a controversy been amicably terminated which had become so serious at the period of my inauguration as to require me , on the 17th of April , 1857 , to direct our minister to demand his passports and return to the United States . Under this convention the Government of New Granada has specially acknowledged itself to be responsible to our citizens for damages which were caused by the riot at Panama on the 15th April , 1856 . These claims , together with other claims of our citizens which had been long urged in vain , are referred for adjustment to a board of commissioners . I submit a copy of the convention to Congress , and recommend the legislation necessary to carry it into effect . Persevering efforts have been made for the adjustment of the claims of American citizens against the Government of Costa Rica , and I am happy to inform you that these have finally prevailed . A convention was signed at the city of San Jose on the 2d July last , between the minister resident of the United States in Costa Rica and the plenipotentiaries of that Republic , referring these claims to a board of commissioners and providing for the payment of their awards . This convention will be submitted immediately to the Senate for their constitutional action . The claims of our citizens upon the Republic of Nicaragua have not yet been provided for by treaty , although diligent efforts for this purpose have been made by our minister resident to that Republic . These are still continued , with a fair prospect of success . Our relations with Mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition . In my last two annual messages I discussed extensively the subject of these relations , and do not now propose to repeat at length the facts and arguments then presented . They proved conclusively that our citizens residing in Mexico and our merchants trading thereto had suffered a series of wrongs and outrages such as we have never patiently borne from any other nation . For these our successive ministers , invoking the faith of treaties , had in the name of their country persistently demanded redress and indemnification , but without the slightest effect . Indeed , so confident had the Mexican authorities become of our patient endurance that they universally believed they might commit these outrages upon American citizens with absolute impunity . Thus wrote our minister in 1856 , and expressed the opinion that nothing but a manifestation of the power of the Government and of its purpose to punish these wrongs will avail . Afterwards , in 1857 , came the adoption of a new constitution for Mexico , the election of a President and Congress under its provisions , and the inauguration of the President . Within one short month , however , this President was expelled from the capital by a rebellion in the army , and the supreme power of the Republic was assigned to General Zuloaga . This usurper was in his turn soon compelled to retire and give place to General Miramon . Under the constitution which had thus been adopted Senor Juarez , as chief justice of the supreme court , became the lawful President of the Republic , and it was for the maintenance of the constitution and his authority derived from it that the civil war commenced and still continues to be prosecuted . Throughout the year 1858 the constitutional party grew stronger and stronger . In the previous history of Mexico a successful military revolution at the capital had almost universally been the signal for submission throughout the Republic . Not so on the present occasion . A majority of the citizens persistently sustained the constitutional Government . When this was recognized , in April , 1859 , by the Government of the United States , its authority extended over a large majority of the Mexican States and people , including Vera Cruz and all the other important seaports of the Republic . From that period our commerce with Mexico began to revive , and the constitutional Government has afforded it all the protection in its power . Meanwhile the Government of Miramon still held sway at the capital and over the surrounding country , and continued its outrages against the few American citizens who still had the courage to remain within its power . To cap the climax , after the battle of Tacubaya , in April , 1859 , General Marquez ordered three citizens of the United States , two of them physicians , to be seized in the hospital at that place , taken out and shot , without crime and without trial . This was done , notwithstanding our unfortunate countrymen were at the moment engaged in the holy cause of affording relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been wounded in the battle , without making any distinction between them . The time had arrived , in my opinion , when this Government was bound to exert its power to avenge and redress the wrongs of our citizens and to afford them protection in Mexico . The interposing obstacle was that the portion of the country under the sway of Miramon could not be reached without passing over territory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional Government . Under these circumstances I deemed it my duty to recommend to Congress in my last annual message the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior , where the Government of Miramon was to be found , with or , if need be , without the consent of the Juarez Government , though it was not doubted that this consent could be obtained . Never have I had a clearer conviction on any subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy . No other alternative was left except the entire abandonment of our fellow citizens who had gone to Mexico under the faith of treaties to the systematic injustice , cruelty , and oppression of Miramon s Government . Besides , it is almost certain that the simple authority to employ this force would of itself have accomplished all our objects without striking a single blow . The constitutional Government would then ere this have been established at the City of Mexico , and would have been ready and willing to the extent of its ability to do us justice . In addition and I deem this a most important consideration European Governments would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concerns of Mexico . We should thus have been relieved from the obligation of resisting , even by force should this become necessary , any attempt by these Governments to deprive our neighboring Republic of portions of her territory a duty from which we could not shrink without abandoning the traditional and established policy of the American people . I am happy to observe that , firmly relying upon the justice and good faith of these Governments , there is no present danger that such a contingency will happen . Having discovered that my recommendations would not be sustained by Congress , the next alternative was to accomplish in some degree , if possible , the same objects by treaty stipulations with the constitutional Government . Such treaties were accordingly concluded by our late able and excellent minister to Mexico , and on the 4th of January last were submitted to the Senate for ratification . As these have not yet received the final action of that body , it would be improper for me to present a detailed statement of their provisions . Still , I may be permitted to express the opinion in advance that they are calculated to promote the agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial interests of the country and to secure our just influence with an adjoining Republic as to whose fortunes and fate we can never feel indifferent , whilst at the same time they provide for the payment of a considerable amount toward the satisfaction of the claims of our injured fellow citizens . At the period of my inauguration I was confronted in Kansas by a revolutionary government existing under what is called the Topeka constitution . Its avowed object was to subdue the Territorial government by force and to inaugurate what was called the Topeka government in its stead . To accomplish this object an extensive military organization was formed , and its command intrusted to the most violent revolutionary leaders . Under these circumstances it became my imperative duty to exert the whole constitutional power of the Executive to prevent the flames of civil war from again raging in Kansas , which in the excited state of the public mind , both North and South , might have extended into the neighboring States . The hostile parties in Kansas had been inflamed against each other by emissaries both from the North and the South to a degree of malignity without parallel in our history . To prevent actual collision and to assist the civil magistrates in enforcing the laws , a strong detachment of the Army was stationed in the Territory , ready to aid the marshal and his deputies when lawfully called upon as a posse comitatus in the execution of civil and criminal process . Still , the troubles in Kansas could not have been permanently settled without an election by the people . The ballot box is the surest arbiter of disputes among freemen . Under this conviction every proper effort was employed to induce the hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates to frame a State constitution , and afterwards at the election to decide whether Kansas should be a slave or free State . The insurgent party refused to vote at either , lest this might be considered a recognition on their part of the Territorial government established by Congress . A better spirit , however , seemed soon after to prevail , and the two parties met face to face at the third election , held on the first Monday of January , 1858 , for members of the legislature and State officers under the Lecompton constitution . The result was the triumph of the antislavery party at the polls . This decision of the ballot box proved clearly that this party were in the majority , and removed the danger of civil war . From that time we have heard little or nothing of the Topeka government , and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles in Kansas was then at an end . The Lecompton constitution , which had been thus recognized at this State election by the votes of both political parties in Kansas , was transmitted to me with the request that I should present it to Congress . This I could not have refused to do without violating my clearest and strongest convictions of duty . The constitution and all the proceedings which preceded and followed its formation were fair and regular on their face . I then believed , and experience has proved , that the interests of the people of Kansas would have been best consulted by its admission as a State into the Union , especially as the majority within a brief period could have amended the constitution according to their will and pleasure . If fraud existed in all or any of these proceedings , it was not for the President but for Congress to investigate and determine the question of fraud and what ought to be its consequences . If at the first two elections the majority refused to vote , it can not be pretended that this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could invalidate an election fairly held under lawful authority , even if they had not subsequently voted at the third election . It is true that the whole constitution had not been submitted to the people , as I always desired but the precedents are numerous of the admission of States into the Union without such submission . It would not comport with my present purpose to review the proceedings of Congress upon the Lecompton constitution . It is sufficient to observe that their final action has removed the last vestige of serious revolutionary troubles . The desperate hand recently assembled under a notorious outlaw in the southern portion of the Territory to resist the execution of the laws and to plunder peaceful citizens will , I doubt not be speedily subdued and brought to justice . Had I treated the Lecompton constitution as a nullity and refused to transmit it to Congress , it is not difficult to imagine , whilst recalling the position of the country at that moment , what would have been the disastrous consequences , both in and out of the Territory , from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the Executive . Peace has also been restored within the Territory of Utah , which at the commencement of my Administration was in a state of open rebellion . This was the more dangerous , as the people , animated by a fanatical spirit and intrenched within their distant mountain fastnesses , might have made a long and formidable resistance . Cost what it might , it was necessary to bring them into subjection to the Constitution and the laws . Sound policy , therefore , as well as humanity , required that this object should if possible be accomplished without the effusion of blood . This could only be effected by sending a military force into the Territory sufficiently strong to convince the people that resistance would be hopeless , and at the same time to offer them a pardon for past offenses on condition of immediate submission to the Government . This policy was pursued with eminent success , and the only cause for regret is the heavy expenditure required to march a large detachment of the Army to that remote region and to furnish it subsistence . Utah is now comparatively peaceful and quiet , and the military force has been withdrawn , except that portion of it necessary to keep the Indians in check and to protect the emigrant trains on their way to our Pacific possessions . In my first annual message I promised to employ my best exertions in cooperation with Congress to reduce the expenditures of the Government within the limits of a wise and judicious economy . An overflowing Treasury had produced habits of prodigality and extravagance which could only be gradually corrected . The work required both time and patience . I applied myself diligently to this task from the beginning and was aided by the able and energetic efforts of the heads of the different Executive Departments . The result of our labors in this good cause did not appear in the sum total of our expenditures for the first two years , mainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily incurred in the Utah expedition and the very large amount of the contingent expenses of Congress during this period . These greatly exceeded the pay and mileage of the members . For the year ending June 30 , 1858 , whilst the pay and mileage amounted to 1 , 490 , 214 , the contingent expenses rose to 2 , 093 , 309 . 79 and for the year ending June 30 , 1859 , whilst the pay and mileage amounted to 859 , 093 . 66 , the contingent expenses amounted to 1 , 431 , 565 . 78 . I am happy , however , to be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1860 , the total expenditures of the Government in all its branches legislative , executive , and judicial exclusive of the public debt , were reduced to the sum of 55 , 402 , 465 . 46 . This conclusively appears from the books of the Treasury . In the year ending June 30 , 1858 , the total expenditure , exclusive of the public debt , amounted to 71 , 901 , 129 . 77 , and that for the year ending June 30 , 1859 , to 66 , 346 , 226 . 13 . Whilst the books of the Treasury show an actual expenditure of 59 , 848 , 474 . 72 for the year ending June 30 , 1860 , including 1 , 040 , 667 . 71 for the contingent expenses of Congress , there must be deducted from this amount the sum of 4 , 296 , 009 . 26 , with the interest upon it of 150 , 000 , appropriated by the act of February 15 , 1860 , for the purpose of supplying the deficiency in the revenues and defraying the expenses of the Post Office Department for the year ending June 30 , 1859 . This sum therefore justly chargeable to the year 1859 , must be deducted from the sum of 59 , 848 , 474 . 72 in order to ascertain the expenditure for the year ending June 30 , 1860 , which leaves a balance for the expenditures of that year of 55 , 402 , 465 . 46 . The interest on the public debt , including Treasury notes , for the same fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1860 , amounted to 3 , 177 , 314 . 62 , which , added to the above sum of 55 , 402 , 465 . 46 , makes the aggregate of 58 , 579 , 780 . 08 . It ought in justice to be observed that several of the estimates from the Departments for the year ending June 30 , 1860 , were reduced by Congress below what was and still is deemed compatible with the public interest . Allowing a liberal margin of 2 , 500 , 000 for this reduction and for other causes , it may be safely asserted that the sum of 61 , 000 , 000 , or , at the most , 62 , 000 , 000 , is amply sufficient to administer the Government and to pay the interest on the public debt , unless contingent events should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary . This result has been attained in a considerable degree by the care exercised by the appropriate Departments in entering into public contracts . I have myself never interfered with the award of any such contract , except in a single case , with the Colonization Society , deeming it advisable to cast the whole responsibility in each case on the proper head of the Department , with the general instruction that these contracts should always be given to the lowest and best bidder . It has ever been my opinion that public contracts are not a legitimate source of patronage to be conferred upon personal or political favorites , but that in all such cases a public officer is bound to act for the Government as a prudent individual would act for himself . It is with great satisfaction I communicate the fact that since the date of my last annual message not a single slave has been imported into the United States in violation of the laws prohibiting the African slave trade . This statement is rounded upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject . Indeed , the spirit which prevailed some time since among a portion of our fellow citizens in favor of this trade seems to have entirely subsided . I also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exists against the crime of setting on foot military expeditions within the limits of the United States to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of unoffending States with whom we are at peace . In this respect a happy change has been effected since the commencement of my Administration . It surely ought to be the prayer of every Christian and patriot that such expeditions may never again receive countenance in our country or depart from our shores . It would be a useless repetition to do more than refer with earnest commendation to my former recommendations in favor of the Pacific railroad of the grant of power to the President to employ the naval force in the vicinity for the protection of the lives and property of our fellow citizens passing in transit over the different Central American routes against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations , and also to protect American merchant vessels , their crews and cargoes , against violent and unlawful seizure and confiscation in the ports of Mexico and the South American Republics when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition . It is my settled conviction that without such a power we do not afford that protection to those engaged in the commerce of the country which they have a right to demand . I again recommend to Congress the passage of a law , in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution , appointing a day certain previous to the 4th March in each year of an odd number for the election of Representatives throughout all the States . A similar power has already been exercised , with general approbation , in the appointment of the same day throughout the Union for holding the election of electors for President and Vice President of the United States . My attention was earnestly directed to this subject from the fact that the Thirty fifth Congress terminated on the 3d March , 1859 , without making the necessary appropriation for the service of the Post Office Department . I was then forced to consider the best remedy for this omission , and an immediate call of the present Congress was the natural resort . Upon inquiry , however , I ascertained that fifteen out of the thirty three States composing the Confederacy were without Representatives , and that consequently these fifteen States would be disfranchised by such a call . These fifteen States will be in the same condition on the 4th March next . Ten of them can not elect Representatives , according to existing State laws , until different periods , extending from the beginning of August next until the months of October and November . In my last message I gave warning that in a time of sudden and alarming danger the salvation of our institutions might depend upon the power of the President immediately to assemble a full Congress to meet the emergency . It is now quite evident that the financial necessities of the Government will require a modification of the tariff during your present session for the purpose of increasing the revenue . In this aspect , I desire to reiterate the recommendation contained in my last two annual messages in favor of imposing specific instead of ad valorem duties on all imported articles to which these can be properly applied . From long observation and experience I am convinced that specific duties are necessary , both to protect the revenue and to secure to our manufacturing interests that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably results from a revenue tariff . As an abstract proposition it may be admitted that ad valorem duties would in theory be the most just and equal . But if the experience of this and of all other commercial nations has demonstrated that such duties can not be assessed and collected without great frauds upon the revenue , then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specific duties . Indeed , from the very nature of an ad valorem duty this must be the result . Under it the inevitable consequence is that foreign goods will be entered at less than their true value . The Treasury will therefore lose the duty on the difference between their real and fictitious value , and to this extent we are defrauded . The temptations which ad valorem duties present to a dishonest importer are irresistible . His object is to pass his goods through the custom house at the very lowest valuation necessary to save them from confiscation . In this he too often succeeds in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officers . Hence the resort to false invoices , one for the purchaser and another for the custom house , and to other expedients to defraud the Government . The honest importer produces his invoice to the collector , stating the actual price at which he purchased the articles abroad . Not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer . And here it may be observed that a very large proportion of the manufactures imported from abroad are consigned for sale to commission merchants , who are mere agents employed by the manufacturers . In such cases no actual sale has been made to fix their value . The foreign manufacturer , if he be dishonest , prepares an invoice of the goods , not at their actual value , but at the very lowest rate necessary to escape detection . In this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merchant . They are thus enabled to undersell the fair trader and drive him from the market . In fact the operation of this system has already driven from the pursuits of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchants whose character throughout the world is the pride of our country . The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific duties , so far as this may be practicable . They dispense with any inquiry at the custom house into the actual cost or value of the article , and it pays the precise amount of duty previously fixed by law . They present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods , who receive but small salaries , and might by undervaluation in a few cases render themselves independent . Besides , specific duties best conform to the requisition in the Constitution that no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another . Under our ad valorem system such preferences are to some extent inevitable , and complaints have often been made that the spirit of this provision has p . 3183 been violated by a lower appraisement of the same articles at one port than at another . An impression strangely enough prevails to some extent that specific duties are necessarily protective duties . Nothing can be more fallacious . Great Britain glories in free trade , and yet her whole revenue from imports is at the present moment collected under a system of specific duties . It is a striking fact in this connection that in the commercial treaty of January 23 , 1860 , between France and England one of the articles provides that the ad valorem duties which it imposes shall be converted into specific duties within six months from its date , and these are to be ascertained by making an average of the prices for six months previous to that time . The reverse of the propositions would be nearer to the truth , because a much larger amount of revenue would be collected by merely converting the ad valorem duties of a tariff into equivalent specific duties . To this extent the revenue would be increased , and in the same proportion the specific duty might be diminished . Specific duties would secure to the American manufacturer the incidental protection to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff , and to this surely no person would object . The framers of the existing tariff have gone further , and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor of large and useful branches of our manufactures , not by raising the rate of duty upon the importation of similar articles from abroad , but , what is the same in effect , by admitting articles free of duty which enter into the composition of their fabrics . Under the present system it has been often truly remarked that this incidental protection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most and increases when he needs it least , and constitutes a sliding scale which always operates against him . The revenues of the country are subject to similar fluctuations . Instead of approaching a steady standard , as would be the case under a system of specific duties , they sink and rise with the sinking and rising prices of articles in foreign countries . It would not be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which would afford additional stability both to our revenue and our manufactures and without injury or injustice to any interest of the country . This might be accomplished by ascertaining the average value of any given article for a series of years at the place of exportation and by simply converting the rate of ad valorem duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for revenue purposes into the form of a specific duty . Such an arrangement could not injure the consumer . If he should pay a greater amount of duty one year , this would be counterbalanced by a lesser amount the next , and in the end the aggregate would be the same . I desire to call your immediate attention to the present condition of the Treasury , so ably and clearly presented by the Secretary in his report to p . 3184 Congress , and to recommend that measures be promptly adopted to enable it to discharge its pressing obligations . The other recommendations of the report are well worthy of your favorable consideration . I herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the Secretaries of War , of the Navy , of the Interior , and of the Postmaster General . The recommendations and suggestions which they contain are highly valuable and deserve your careful attention . The report of the Postmaster General details the circumstances under which Cornelius Vanderbilt , on my request , agreed in the month of July last to carry the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts . Had he not thus acted this important intercommunication must have been suspended , at least for a season . The Postmaster General had no power to make him any other compensation than the postages on the mail matter which he might carry . It was known at the time that these postages would fall far short of an adequate compensation , as well as of the sum which the same service had previously cost the Government . Vanderbilt , in a commendable spirit , was willing to rely upon the justice of Congress to make up the deficiency , and I therefore recommend that an appropriation may be granted for this purpose . I should do great injustice to the Attorney General were I to omit the mention of his distinguished services in the measures adopted and prosecuted by him for the defense of the Government against numerous and unfounded claims to land in California purporting to have been made by the Mexican Government previous to the treaty of cession . The successful opposition to these claims has saved the United States public property worth many millions of dollars and to individuals holding title under them to at least an equal amount . It has been represented to me from sources which I deem reliable that the inhabitants in several portions of Kansas have been reduced nearly to a state of starvation on account of the almost total failure of their crops , whilst the harvests in every other portion of the country have been abundant . The prospect before them for the approaching winter is well calculated to enlist the sympathies of every heart . The destitution appears to be so general that it can not be relieved by private contributions , and they are in such indigent circumstances as to be unable to purchase the necessaries of life for themselves . I refer the subject to Congress . If any constitutional measure for their relief can be devised , I would recommend its adoption . I cordially commend to your favorable regard the interests of the people of this District . They are eminently entitled to your consideration , especially since , unlike the people of the States , they can appeal to no government except that of the Union .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives When we compare the condition of the country at the present day with what it was one year ago at the meeting of Congress , we have much reason for gratitude to that Almighty Providence which has never failed to interpose for our relief at the most critical periods of our history . One year ago the sectional strife between the North and the South on the dangerous subject of slavery had again become so intense as to threaten the peace and perpetuity of the Confederacy . The application for the admission of Kansas as a State into the Union fostered this unhappy agitation and brought the whole subject once more before Congress . It was the desire of every patriot that such measures of legislation might be adopted as would remove the excitement from the States and confine it to the Territory where it legitimately belonged . Much has been done , I am happy to say , toward the accomplishment of this object during the last session of Congress . The Supreme Court of the United States had previously decided that all American citizens have an equal right to take into the Territories whatever is held as property under the laws of any of the States , and to hold such property there under the guardianship of the Federal Constitution so long as the Territorial condition shall remain . This is now a well established position , and the proceedings of the last session were alone wanting to give it practical effect . The principle has been recognized in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of both Houses of Congress that a Territory has a right to come into the Union either as a free or a slave State , according to the will of a majority of its people . The just equality of all the States has thus been vindicated and a fruitful source of dangerous dissension among them has been removed . Whilst such has been the beneficial tendency of your legislative proceedings outside of Kansas , their influence has nowhere been so happy as within that Territory itself . Left to manage and control its own affairs in its own way , without the pressure of external influence , the revolutionary Topeka organization and all resistance to the Territorial government established by Congress have been finally abandoned . As a natural consequence that fine Territory now appears to be tranquil and prosperous and is attracting increasing thousands of immigrants to make it their happy home . The past unfortunate experience of Kansas has enforced the lesson , so often already taught , that resistance to lawful authority under our form of government can not fail in the end to prove disastrous to its authors . Had the people of the Territory yielded obedience to the laws enacted by their legislature , it would at the present moment have contained a large additional population of industrious and enterprising citizens , who have been deterred from entering its borders by the existence of civil strife and organized rebellion . It was the resistance to rightful authority and the persevering attempts to establish a revolutionary government under the Topeka constitution which caused the people of Kansas to commit the grave error of refusing to vote for delegates to the convention to frame a constitution under a law not denied to be fair and just in its provisions . This refusal to vote has been the prolific source of all the evils which have followed , In their hostility to the Territorial government they disregarded the principle , absolutely essential to the working of our form of government , that a majority of those who vote , not the majority who may remain at home , from whatever cause , must decide the result of an election . For this reason , seeking to take advantage of their own error , they denied the authority of the convention thus elected to frame a constitution . The convention , notwithstanding , proceeded to adopt a constitution unexceptionable in its general features , and providing for the submission of the slavery question to a vote of the people , which , in my opinion , they were bound to do under the Kansas and Nebraska act . This was the all important question which had alone convulsed the Territory and yet the opponents of the lawful government , persisting in their first error , refrained from exercising their right to vote , and preferred that slavery should continue rather than surrender their revolutionary Topeka organization . A wiser and better spirit seemed to prevail before the first Monday of January last , when an election was held under the constitution . A majority of the people then voted for a governor and other State officers , for a Member of Congress and members of the State legislature . This election was warmly contested by the two political parties in Kansas , and a greater vote was polled than at any previous election . A large majority of the members of the legislature elect belonged to that party which had previously refused to vote . The antislavery party were thus placed in the ascendant , and the political power of the State was in their own hands . Had Congress admitted Kansas into the Union under the Lecompton constitution , the legislature might at its very first session have submitted the question to a vote of the people whether they would or would not have a convention to amend their constitution , either on the slavery or any other question , and have adopted all necessary means for giving speedy effect to the will of the majority . Thus the Kansas question would have been immediately and finally settled . Under these circumstances I submitted to Congress the constitution thus framed , with all the officers already elected necessary to put the State government into operation , accompanied by a strong recommendation in favor of the admission of Kansas as a State . In the course of my long public life I have never performed any official act which in the retrospect has afforded me more heartfelt satisfaction . Its admission could have inflicted no possible injury on any human being , whilst it would within a brief period have restored peace to Kansas and harmony to the Union . In that event the slavery question would ere this have been finally settled according to the legally expressed will of a majority of the voters , and popular sovereignty would thus have been vindicated in a constitutional manner . With my deep convictions of duty I could have pursued no other course . It is true that as an individual I had expressed an opinion , both before and during the session of the convention , in favor of submitting the remaining clauses of the constitution , as well as that concerning slavery , to the people . But , acting in an official character , neither myself nor any human authority had the power to rejudge the proceedings of the convention and declare the constitution which it had framed to be a nullity . To have done this would have been a violation of the Kansas and Nebraska act , which left the people of the Territory perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way , subject only to the Constitution of the United States . It would equally have violated the great principle of popular sovereignty , at the foundation of our institutions , to deprive the people of the power , if they thought proper to exercise it , of confiding to delegates elected by themselves the trust of framing a constitution without requiring them to subject their constituents to the trouble , expense , and delay of a second election . It would have been in opposition to many precedents in our history , commencing in the very best age of the Republic , of the admission of Territories as States into the Union without a previous vote of the people approving their constitution . It is to be lamented that a question so insignificant when viewed in its practical effects on the people of Kansas , whether decided one way or the other , should have kindled such a flame of excitement throughout the country . This reflection may prove to be a lesson of wisdom and of warning for our future guidance . Practically considered , the question is simply whether the people of that Territory should first come into the Union and then change any provision in their constitution not agreeable to themselves , or accomplish the very same object by remaining out of the Union and framing another constitution in accordance with their will . In either case the result would be precisely the same . The only difference , in point of fact , is that the object would have been much sooner attained and the pacification of Kansas more speedily effected had it been admitted as a State during the last session of Congress . My recommendation , however , for the immediate admission of Kansas failed to meet the approbation of Congress . They deemed it wiser to adopt a different measure for the settlement of the question . For my own part , I should have been willing to yield my assent to almost any constitutional measure to accomplish this object . I therefore cordially acquiesced in what has been called the English compromise and approved the act for the admission of the State of Kansas into the Union upon the terms therein prescribed . Under the ordinance which accompanied the Lecompton constitution the people of Kansas had claimed double the quantity of public lands for the support of common schools which had ever been previously granted to any State upon entering the Union , and also the alternate sections of land for 12 miles on each side of two railroads proposed to be constructed from the northern to the southern boundary and from the eastern to the western boundary of the State . Congress , deeming these claims unreasonable , provided by the act of May 4 , 1858 , to which I have just referred , for the admission of the State on an equal footing with the original States , but upon the fundamental condition precedent that a majority of the people thereof , at an election to be held for that purpose , should , in place of the very large grants of public lands which they had demanded under the ordinance , accept such grants as had been made to Minnesota and other new States . Under this act , should a majority reject the proposition offered them , it shall be deemed and held that the people of Kansas do not desire admission into the Union with said constitution under the conditions set forth in said proposition . In that event the act authorizes the people of the Territory to elect delegates to form a constitution and State government for themselves whenever , and not before , it is ascertained by a census , duly and legally taken , that the population of said Territory equals or exceeds the ratio of representation required for a member of the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States . The delegates thus assembled shall first determine by a vote whether it is the wish of the people of the proposed State to be admitted into the Union at that time , and , if so , shall proceed to form a constitution and take all necessary steps for the establishment of a State government in conformity with the Federal Constitution . After this constitution shall have been formed , Congress , carrying out the principles of popular sovereignty and nonintervention , have left the mode and manner of its approval or ratification by the people of the proposed State to be prescribed by law , and they shall then be admitted into the Union as a State under such constitution , thus fairly and legally made , with or without slavery , as said constitution may prescribe . An election was held throughout Kansas , in pursuance of the provisions of this act , on the 2d day of August last , and it resulted in the rejection by a large majority of the proposition submitted to the people by Congress . This being the case , they are now authorized to form another constitution , preparatory to admission into the Union , but not until their number , as ascertained by a census , shall equal or exceed the ratio required to elect a member to the House of Representatives . It is not probable , in the present state of the case , that a third constitution can be lawfully framed and presented to Congress by Kansas before its population shall have reached the designated number . Nor is it to be presumed that after their sad experience in resisting the Territorial laws they will attempt to adopt a constitution in express violation of the provisions of an act of Congress . During the session of 1856 much of the time of Congress was occupied on the question of admitting Kansas under the Topeka constitution . Again , nearly the whole of the last session was devoted to the question of its admission under the Lecompton constitution . Surely it is not unreasonable to require the people of Kansas to wait before making a third attempt until the number of their inhabitants shall amount to 93 , 420 . During this brief period the harmony of the States as well as the great business interests of the country demand that the people of the Union shall not for a third time be convulsed by another agitation on the Kansas question . By waiting for a short time and acting in obedience to law Kansas will glide into the Union without the slightest impediment . This excellent provision , which Congress have applied to Kansas , ought to be extended and rendered applicable to all Territories which may hereafter seek admission into the Union . Whilst Congress possess the undoubted power of admitting a new State into the Union , however small may be the number of its inhabitants , yet this power ought not , in my opinion , to be exercised before the population shall amount to the ratio required by the act for the admission of Kansas . Had this been previously the rule , the country would have escaped all the evils and misfortunes to which it has been exposed by the Kansas question . Of course it would be unjust to give this rule a retrospective application , and exclude a State which , acting upon the past practice of the Government , has already formed its constitution , elected its legislature and other officers , and is now prepared to enter the Union . The rule ought to be adopted , whether we consider its bearing on the people of the Territories or upon the people of the existing States . Many of the serious dissentions which have prevailed in Congress and throughout the country would have been avoided had this rule been established at an earlier period of the Government . Immediately upon the formation of a new Territory people from different States and from foreign countries rush into it for the laudable purpose of improving their condition . Their first duty to themselves is to open and cultivate farms , to construct roads , to establish schools , to erect places of religious worship , and to devote their energies generally to reclaim the wilderness and to lay the foundations of a flourishing and prosperous commonwealth . If in this incipient condition , with a population of a few thousand , they should prematurely enter the Union , they are oppressed by the burden of State taxation , and the means necessary for the improvement of the Territory and the advancement of their own interests are thus diverted to very different purposes . The Federal Government has ever been a liberal parent to the Territories and a generous contributor to the useful enterprises of the early settlers . It has paid the expenses of their governments and legislative assemblies out of the common Treasury , and thus relieved them from a heavy charge . Under these circumstances nothing can be better calculated to retard their material progress than to divert them from their useful employments by prematurely exciting angry political contests among themselves for the benefit of aspiring leaders . It is surely no hardship for embryo governors , Senators , and Members of Congress to wait until the number of inhabitants shall equal those of a single Congressional district . They surely ought not to be permitted to rush into the Union with a population less than one half of several of the large counties in the interior of some of the States . This was the condition of Kansas when it made application to be admitted under the Topeka constitution . Besides , it requires some time to render the mass of a population collected in a new Territory at all homogeneous and to unite them on anything like a fixed policy . Establish the rule , and all will look forward to it and govern themselves accordingly . But justice to the people of the several States requires that this rule should be established by Congress . Each State is entitled to two Senators and at least one Representative in Congress . Should the people of the States fail to elect a Vice President , the power devolves upon the Senate to select this officer from the two highest candidates on the list . In case of the death of the President , the Vice President thus elected by the Senate becomes President of the United States . On all questions of legislation the Senators from the smallest States of the Union have an equal vote with those from the largest . The same may be said in regard to the ratification of treaties and of Executive appointments . All this has worked admirably in practice , whilst it conforms in principle with the character of a Government instituted by sovereign States . I presume no American citizen would desire the slightest change in the arrangement . Still , is it not unjust and unequal to the existing States to invest some 40 , 000 or 50 , 000 people collected in a Territory with the attributes of sovereignty and place them on an equal footing with Virginia and New York in the Senate of the United States For these reasons I earnestly recommend the passage of a general act which shall provide that , upon the application of a Territorial legislature declaring their belief that the Territory contains a number of inhabitants which , if in a State , would entitle them to elect a Member of Congress , it shall be the duty of the President to cause a census of the inhabitants to be taken , and if found sufficient then by the terms of this act to authorize them to proceed in their own way to frame a State constitution preparatory to admission into the Union . I also recommend that an appropriation may be made to enable the President to take a census of the people of Kansas . The present condition of the Territory of Utah , when contrasted with what it was one year ago , is a subject for congratulation . It was then in a state of open rebellion , and , cost what it might , the character of the Government required that this rebellion should be suppressed and the Mormons compelled to yield obedience to the Constitution and the laws . In order to accomplish this object , as I informed you in my last annual message , I appointed a new governor instead of Brigham Young , and other Federal officers to take the place of those who , consulting their personal safety , had found it necessary to withdraw from the Territory . To protect these civil officers , and to aid them , as a posse comitatus , in the execution of the laws in case of need , I ordered a detachment of the Army to accompany them to Utah . The necessity for adopting these measures is now demonstrated . On the 15th of September , 1857 , Governor Young issued his proclamation , in the style of an independent sovereign , announcing his purpose to resist by force of arms the entry of the United States troops into our own Territory of Utah . By this he required all the forces in the Territory to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment s notice to repel any and all such invasion , and established martial law from its date throughout the Territory . These proved to be no idle threats . Forts Bridger and Supply were vacated and burnt down by the Mormons to deprive our troops of a shelter after their long and fatiguing march . Orders were issued by Daniel Wells , styling himself Lieutenant General , Nauvoo Legion , to stampede the animals of the United States troops on their march , to set fire to their trains , to burn the grass and the whole country before them and on their flanks , to keep them from sleeping by night surprises , and to blockade the road by felling trees and destroying the fords of rivers , etc . These orders were promptly and effectually obeyed . On the 4th of October , 1857 , the Mormons captured and burned , on Green River , three of our supply trains , consisting of seventy five wagons loaded with provisions and tents for the army , and carried away several hundred animals . This diminished the supply of provisions so materially that General Johnston was obliged to reduce the ration , and even with this precaution there was only sufficient left to subsist the troops until the 1st of June . Our little army behaved admirably in their encampment at Fort Bridger under these trying privations . In the midst of the mountains , in a dreary , unsettled , and inhospitable region , more than a thousand miles from home , they passed the severe and inclement winter without a murmur . They looked forward with confidence for relief from their country in due season , and in this they were not disappointed . The Secretary of War employed all his energies to forward them the necessary supplies and to muster and send such a military force to Utah as would render resistance on the part of the Mormons hopeless , and thus terminate the war without the effusion of blood . In his efforts he was efficiently sustained by Congress . They granted appropriations sufficient to cover the deficiency thus necessarily created , and also provided for raising two regiments of volunteers for the purpose of quelling disturbances in the Territory of Utah , for the protection of supply and emigrant trains , and the suppression of Indian hostilities on the frontiers . Happily , there was no occasion to call these regiments into service . If there had been , I should have felt serious embarrassment in selecting them , so great was the number of our brave and patriotic citizens anxious to serve their country in this distant and apparently dangerous expedition . Thus it has ever been , and thus may it ever be . The wisdom and economy of sending sufficient reenforcements to Utah are established , not only by the event , but in the opinion of those who from their position and opportunities are the most capable of forming a correct judgment . General Johnston , the commander of the forces , in addressing the Secretary of War from Fort Bridger under date of October 18 , 1857 , expresses the opinion that unless a large force is sent here , from the nature of the country a protracted war on their the Mormons s part is inevitable . This he considered necessary to terminate the war speedily and more economically than if attempted by insufficient means . In the meantime it was my anxious desire that the Mormons should yield obedience to the Constitution and the laws without rendering it necessary to resort to military force . To aid in accomplishing this object , I deemed it advisable in April last to dispatch two distinguished citizens of the United States , Powell and McCulloch , to Utah . They bore with them a proclamation addressed by myself to the inhabitants of Utah , dated on the 6th day of that month , warning them of their true condition and how hopeless it was on their part to persist in rebellion against the United States , and offering all those who should submit to the laws a full pardon for their past seditions and treasons . At the same time I assured those who should persist in rebellion against the United States that they must expect no further lenity , but look to be rigorously dealt with according to their deserts . The instructions to these agents , as well as a copy of the proclamation and their reports , are herewith submitted . It will be seen by their report of the 3d of July last that they have fully confirmed the opinion expressed by General Johnston in the previous October as to the necessity of sending reenforcements to Utah . In this they state that they are firmly impressed with the belief that the presence of the Army here and the large additional force that had been ordered to this Territory were the chief inducements that caused the Mormons to abandon the idea of resisting the authority of the United States . A less decisive policy would probably have resulted in a long , bloody , and expensive war . These gentlemen conducted themselves to my entire satisfaction and rendered useful services in executing the humane intentions of the Government . It also affords me great satisfaction to state that Governor Cumming has performed his duty in an able and conciliatory manner and with the happiest effect . I can not in this connection refrain from mentioning the valuable services of Colonel Thomas Kane , who , from motives of pure benevolence and without any official character or pecuniary compensation , visited Utah during the last inclement winter for the purpose of contributing to the pacification of the Territory . I am happy to inform you that the governor and other civil officers of Utah are now performing their appropriate functions without resistance . The authority of the Constitution and the laws has been fully restored and peace prevails throughout the Territory . A portion of the troops sent to Utah are now encamped in Cedar Valley , 44 miles southwest of Salt Lake City , and the remainder have been ordered to Oregon to suppress Indian hostilities . The march of the army to Salt Lake City through the IndianTerritory has had a powerful effect in restraining the hostile feelings against the United States which existed among the Indians in that region and in securing emigrants to the far West against their depredations . This will also be the means of establishing military posts and promoting settlements along the route . I recommend that the benefits of our land laws and preemption system be extended to the people of Utah by the establishment of a land office in that Territory . I have occasion also to congratulate you on the result of our negotiations with China . You were informed by my last annual message that our minister had been instructed to occupy a neutral position in the hostilities conducted by Great Britain and France against Canton . He was , however , at the same time directed to cooperate cordially with the British and French ministers in all peaceful measures to secure by treaty those just concessions to foreign commerce which the nations of the world had a right to demand . It was impossible for me to proceed further than this on my own authority without usurping the war making power , which under the Constitution belongs exclusively to Congress . Besides , after a careful examination of the nature and extent of our grievances , I did not believe they were of such a pressing and aggravated character as would have justified Congress in declaring war against the Chinese Empire without first making another earnest attempt to adjust them by peaceful negotiation . I was the more inclined to this opinion because of the severe chastisement which had then but recently been inflicted upon the Chinese by our squadron in the capture and destruction of the Barrier forts to avenge an alleged insult to our flag . The event has proved the wisdom of our neutrality . Our minister has executed his instructions with eminent skill and ability . In conjunction with the Russian plenipotentiary , he has peacefully , but effectually , cooperated with the English and French plenipotentiaries , and each of the four powers has concluded a separate treaty with China of a highly satisfactory character . The treaty concluded by our own plenipotentiary will immediately be submitted to the Senate . I am happy to announce that through the energetic yet conciliatory efforts of our consul general in Japan a new treaty has been concluded with that Empire , which may be expected materially to augment our trade and intercourse in that quarter and remove from our countrymen the disabilities which have heretofore been imposed upon the exercise of their religion . The treaty shall be submitted to the Senate for approval without delay . It is my earnest desire that every misunderstanding with the Government of Great Britain should be amicably and speedily adjusted . It has been the misfortune of both countries , almost ever since the period of the Revolution , to have been annoyed by a succession of irritating and dangerous questions , threatening their friendly relations . This has partially prevented the full development of those feelings of mutual friendship between the people of the two countries so natural in themselves and so conducive to their common interest . Any serious interruption of the commerce between the United States and Great Britain would be equally injurious to both . In fact , no two nations have ever existed on the face of the earth which could do each other so much good or so much harm . Entertaining these sentiments , I am gratified to inform you that the long pending controversy between the two Governments in relation to the question of visitation and search has been amicably adjusted . The claim on the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit American vessels on the high seas in time of peace could not be sustained under the law of nations , and it had been overruled by her own most eminent jurists . This question was recently brought to an issue by the repeated acts of British cruisers in boarding and searching our merchant vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and the adjacent seas . These acts were the more injurious and annoying , as these waters are traversed by a large portion of the commerce and navigation of the United States and their free and unrestricted use is essential to the security of the coastwise trade between the different States of the Union . Such vexatious interruptions could not fail to excite the feelings of the country and to require the interposition of the Government . Remonstrances were addressed to the British Government against these violations of our rights of sovereignty , and a naval force was at the same time ordered to the Cuban waters with directions to protect all vessels of the United States on the high seas from search or detention by the vessels of war of any other nation . These measures received the unqualified and even enthusiastic approbation of the American people . Most fortunately , however , no collision took place , and the British Government promptly avowed its recognition of the principles of international law upon this subject as laid down by the Government of the United States in the note of the Secretary of State to the British minister at Washington of April 10 , 1858 , which secure the vessels of the United States upon the high seas from visitation or search in time of peace under any circumstances whatever . The claim has been abandoned in a manner reflecting honor on the British Government and evincing a just regard for the law of nations , and can not fail to strengthen the amicable relations between the two countries . The British Government at the same time proposed to the United States that some mode should be adopted , by mutual arrangement between the two countries , of a character which may be found effective without being offensive , for verifying the nationality of vessels suspected on good grounds of carrying false colors . They have also invited the United States to take the initiative and propose measures for this purpose . Whilst declining to assume so grave a responsibility , the Secretary of State has informed the British Government that we are ready to receive any proposals which they may feel disposed to offer having this object in view , and to consider them in an amicable spirit . A strong opinion is , however , expressed that the occasional abuse of the flag of any nation is an evil far less to be deprecated than would be the establishment of any regulations which might be incompatible with the freedom of the seas . This Government has yet received no communication specifying the manner in which the British Government would propose to carry out their suggestion , and I am inclined to believe that no plan which can be devised will be free from grave embarrassments . Still , I shall form no decided opinion on the subject until I shall have carefully and in the best spirit examined any proposals which they may think proper to make . I am truly sorry I can not also inform you that the complications between Great Britain and the United States arising out of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty of April , 1850 , have been finally adjusted . At the commencement of your last session I had reason to hope that , emancipating themselves from further unavailing discussions , the two Governments would proceed to settle the Central American questions in a practical manner , alike honorable and satisfactory to both and this hope I have not yet abandoned . In my last annual message I stated that overtures had been made by the British Government for this purpose in a friendly spirit , which I cordially reciprocated . Their proposal was to withdraw these questions from direct negotiation between the two Governments , but to accomplish the same object by a negotiation between the British Government and each of the Central American Republics whose territorial interests are immediately involved . The settlement was to be made in accordance with the general tenor of the interpretation placed upon the Clayton and Bulwer treaty by the United States , with certain modifications . As negotiations are still pending upon this basis , it would not be proper for me now to communicate their present condition . A final settlement of these questions is greatly to be desired , as this would wipe out the last remaining subject of dispute between the two countries . Our relations with the great Empires of France and Russia , as well as with all other Governments on the continent of Europe , except that of Spain , continue to be of the most friendly character . With Spain our relations remain in an unsatisfactory condition . In my message of December last I informed you that our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Madrid had asked for his recall , and it was my purpose to send out a new minister to that Court with special instructions on all questions pending between the two Governments , and with a determination to have them speedily and amicably adjusted if that were possible . This purpose has been hitherto defeated by causes which I need not enumerate . The mission to Spain has been intrusted to a distinguished citizen of Kentucky , who will proceed to Madrid without delay and make another and a final attempt to obtain justice from that Government . Spanish officials under the direct control of the Captain General of Cuba have insulted our national flag and in repeated instances have from time to time inflicted injuries on the persons and property of our citizens . These have given birth to numerous claims against the Spanish Government , the merits of which have been ably discussed for a series of years by our successive diplomatic representatives . Notwithstanding this , we have not arrived at a practical result in any single instance , unless we may except the case of the Black Warrior , under the late Administration , and that presented an outrage of such a character as would have justified an immediate resort to war . All our attempts to obtain redress have been baffled and defeated . The frequent and oft recurring changes in the Spanish ministry have been employed as reasons for delay . We have been compelled to wait again and again until the new minister shall have had time to investigate the justice of our demands . Even what have been denominated the Cuban claims , in which more than 100 of our citizens are directly interested , have furnished no exception . These claims were for the refunding of duties unjustly exacted from American vessels at different custom houses in Cuba so long ago as the year 1844 . The principles upon which they rest are so manifestly equitable and just that , after a period of nearly ten years , in 1854 they were recognized by the Spanish Government . Proceedings were afterwards instituted to ascertain their amount , and this was finally fixed , according to their own statement with which we were satisfied , at the sum of 128 , 635 . 54 . Just at the moment , after a delay of fourteen years , when we had reason to expect that this sum would be repaid with interest , we have received a proposal offering to refund one third of that amount 42 , 878 . 41 , but without interest , if we would accept this in full satisfaction . The offer is also accompanied by a declaration that this indemnification is not founded on any reason of strict justice , but is made as a special favor . One alleged cause for procrastination in the examination and adjustment of our claims arises from an obstacle which it is the duty of the Spanish Government to remove . Whilst the Captain General of Cuba is invested with general despotic authority in the government of that island , the power is withheld from him to examine and redress wrongs committed by officials under his control on citizens of the United States . Instead of making our complaints directly to him at Havana , we are obliged to present them through our minister at Madrid . These are then referred back to the Captain General for information , and much time is thus consumed in preliminary investigations and correspondence between Madrid and Cuba before the Spanish Government will consent to proceed to negotiation . Many of the difficulties between the two Governments would be obviated and a long train of negotiation avoided if the Captain General were invested with authority to settle questions of easy solution on the spot , where all the facts are fresh and could be promptly and satisfactorily ascertained . We have hitherto in vain urged upon the Spanish Government to confer this power upon the Captain General , and our minister to Spain will again be instructed to urge this subject on their notice . In this respect we occupy a different position from the powers of Europe . Cuba is almost within sight of our shores our commerce with it is far greater than that of any other nation , including Spain itself , and our citizens are in habits of daily and extended personal intercourse with every part of the island . It is therefore a great grievance that when any difficulty occurs , no matter how unimportant , which might be readily settled at the moment , we should be obliged to resort to Madrid , especially when the very first step to be taken there is to refer it back to Cuba . The truth is that Cuba , in its existing colonial condition , is a constant source of injury and annoyance to the American people . It is the only spot in the civilized world where the African slave trade is tolerated , and we are bound by treaty with Great Britain to maintain a naval force on the coast of Africa , at much expense both of life and treasure , solely for the purpose of arresting slavers bound to that island . The late serious difficulties between the United States and Great Britain respecting the right of search , now so happily terminated , could never have arisen if Cuba had not afforded a market for slaves . As long as this market shall remain open there can be no hope for the civilization of benighted Africa . Whilst the demand for slaves continues in Cuba wars will be waged among the petty and barbarous chiefs in Africa for the purpose of seizing subjects to supply this trade . In such a condition of affairs it is impossible that the light of civilization and religion can ever penetrate these dark abodes . It has been made known to the world by my predecessors that the United States have on several occasions endeavored to acquire Cuba from Spain by honorable negotiation . If this were accomplished , the last relic of the African slave trade would instantly disappear . We would not , if we could , acquire Cuba in any other manner . This is due to our national character . All the territory which we have acquired since the origin of the Government has been by fair purchase from France , Spain , and Mexico or by the free and voluntary act of the independent State of Texas in blending her destinies with our own . This course we shall ever pursue , unless circumstances should occur which we do not now anticipate , rendering a departure from it clearly justifiable under the imperative and overruling law of self preservation . The island of Cuba , from its geographical position , commands the mouth of the Mississippi and the immense and annually increasing trade , foreign and coastwise , from the valley of that noble river , now embracing half the sovereign States of the Union . With that island under the dominion of a distant foreign power this trade , of vital importance to these States , is exposed to the danger of being destroyed in time of war , and it has hitherto been subjected to perpetual injury and annoyance in time of peace . Our relations with Spain , which ought to be of the most friendly character , must always be placed in jeopardy whilst the existing colonial government over the island shall remain in its present condition . Whilst the possession of the island would be of vast importance to the United States , its value to Spain is comparatively unimportant . Such was the relative situation of the parties when the great Napoleon transferred Louisiana to the United States . Jealous as he ever was of the national honor and interests of France , no person throughout the world has imputed blame to him for accepting a pecuniary equivalent for this cession . The publicity which has been given to our former negotiations upon this subject and the large appropriation which may be required to effect the purpose render it expedient before making another attempt to renew the negotiation that I should lay the whole subject before Congress . This is especially necessary , as it may become indispensable to success that I should be intrusted with the means of making an advance to the Spanish Government immediately after the signing of the treaty , without awaiting the ratification of it by the Senate . I am encouraged to make this suggestion by the example of Jefferson previous to the purchase of Louisiana from France and by that of Polk in view of the acquisition of territory from Mexico . I refer the whole subject to Congress and commend it to their careful consideration . I repeat the recommendation made in my message of December last in favor of an appropriation to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the Amistad case . President Polk first made a similar recommendation in December , 1847 , and it was repeated by my immediate predecessor in December , 1853 . I entertain no doubt that indemnity is fairly due to these claimants under our treaty with Spain of October 27 , 1795 and whilst demanding justice we ought to do justice . An appropriation promptly made for this purpose could not fail to exert a favorable influence on our negotiations with Spain . Our position in relation to the independent States south of us on this continent , and especially those within the limits of North America , is of a peculiar character . The northern boundary of Mexico is coincident with our own southern boundary from ocean to ocean , and we must necessarily feel a deep interest in all that concerns the well being and the fate of so near a neighbor . We have always cherished the kindest wishes for the success of that Republic , and have indulged the hope that it might at last , after all its trials , enjoy peace and prosperity under a free and stable government . We have never hitherto interfered , directly or indirectly , with its internal affairs , and it is a duty which we owe to ourselves to protect the integrity of its territory against the hostile interference of any other power . Our geographical position , our direct interest in all that concerns Mexico , and our well settled policy in regard to the North American continent render this an indispensable duty . Mexico has been in a state of constant revolution almost ever since it achieved its independence . One military leader after another has usurped the Government in rapid succession , and the various constitutions from time to time adopted have been set at naught almost as soon as they were proclaimed . The successive Governments have afforded no adequate protection , either to Mexican citizens or foreign residents , against lawless violence . Heretofore a seizure of the capital by a military chieftain has been generally followed by at least the nominal submission of the country to his rule for a brief period , but not so at the present crisis of Mexican affairs . A civil war has been raging for some time throughout the Republic between the central Government at the City of Mexico , which has endeavored to subvert the constitution last framed by military power , and those who maintain the authority of that constitution . The antagonist parties each hold possession of different States of the Republic , and the fortunes of the war are constantly changing . Meanwhile the most reprehensible means have been employed by both parties to extort money from foreigners , as well as natives , to carry on this ruinous contest . The truth is that this fine country , blessed with a productive soil and a benign climate , has been reduced by civil dissension to a condition of almost hopeless anarchy and imbecility . It would be vain for this Government to attempt to enforce payment in money of the claims of American citizens , now amounting to more than 10 , 000 , 000 , against Mexico , because she is destitute of all pecuniary means to satisfy these demands . Our late minister was furnished with ample powers and instructions for the adjustment of all pending questions with the central Government of Mexico , and he performed his duty with zeal and ability . The claims of our citizens , some of them arising out of the violation of an express provision of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , and others from gross injuries to persons as well as property , have remained unredressed and even unnoticed . Remonstrances against these grievances have been addressed without effect to that Government . Meantime in various parts of the Republic instances have been numerous of the murder , imprisonment , and plunder of our citizens by different parties claiming and exercising a local jurisdiction but the central Government , although repeatedly urged thereto , have made no effort either to punish the authors of these outrages or to prevent their recurrence . No American citizen can now visit Mexico on lawful business without imminent danger to his person and property . There is no adequate protection to either , and in this respect our treaty with that Republic is almost a dead letter . This state of affairs was brought to a crisis in May last by the promulgation of a decree levying a contribution pro rata upon all the capital in the Republic between certain specified amounts , whether held by Mexicans or foreigners . Forsyth , regarding this decree in the light of a forced loan , formally protested against its application to his countrymen and advised them not to pay the contribution , but to suffer it to be forcibly exacted . Acting upon this advice , an American citizen refused to pay the contribution , and his property was seized by armed men to satisfy the amount . Not content with this , the Government proceeded still further and issued a decree banishing him from the country . Our minister immediately notified them that if this decree should be carried into execution he would feel it to be his duty to adopt the most decided measures that belong to the powers and obligations of the representative office . Notwithstanding this warning , the banishment was enforced , and Forsyth promptly announced to the Government the suspension of the political relations of his legation with them until the pleasure of his own Government should be ascertained . This Government did not regard the contribution imposed by the decree of the 15th May last to be in strictness a forced loan , and as such prohibited by the tenth article of the treaty of 1826 between Great Britain and Mexico , to the benefits of which American citizens are entitled by treaty yet the imposition of the contribution upon foreigners was considered an unjust and oppressive measure . Besides , internal factions in other parts of the Republic were at the same time levying similar exactions upon the property of our citizens and interrupting their commerce . There had been an entire failure on the part of our minister to secure redress for the wrongs which our citizens had endured , notwithstanding his persevering efforts . And from the temper manifested by the Mexican Government he had repeatedly assured us that no favorable change could be expected until the United States should give striking evidence of their will and power to protect their citizens , and that severe chastening is the only earthly remedy for our grievances . From this statement of facts it would have been worse than idle to direct Forsyth to retrace his steps and resume diplomatic relations with that Government , and it was therefore deemed proper to sanction his withdrawal of the legation from the City of Mexico . Abundant cause now undoubtedly exists for a resort to hostilities against the Government still holding possession of the capital . Should they succeed in subduing the constitutional forces , all reasonable hope will then have expired of a peaceful settlement of our difficulties . On the other hand , should the constitutional party prevail and their authority be established over the Republic , there is reason to hope that they will be animated by a less unfriendly spirit and may grant that redress to American citizens which justice requires so far as they may possess the means . But for this expectation I should at once have recommended to Congress to grant the necessary power to the President to take possession of a sufficient portion of the remote and unsettled territory of Mexico , to be held in pledge until our injuries shall be redressed and our just demands be satisfied . We have already exhausted every milder means of obtaining justice . In such a case this remedy of reprisals is recognized by the law of nations , not only as just in itself , but as a means of preventing actual war . But there is another view of our relations with Mexico , arising from the unhappy condition of affairs along our southwestern frontier , which demands immediate action . In that remote region , where there are but few white inhabitants , large bands of hostile and predatory Indians roam promiscuously over the Mexican States of Chihuahua and Sonora and our adjoining Territories . The local governments of these States are perfectly helpless and are kept in a state of constant alarm by the Indians . They have not the power , if they possessed the will , even to restrain lawless Mexicans from passing the border and committing depredations on our remote settlers . A state of anarchy and violence prevails throughout that distant frontier . The laws are a dead letter and life and property wholly insecure . For this reason the settlement of Arizona is arrested , whilst it is of great importance that a chain of inhabitants should extend all along its southern border sufficient for their own protection and that of the United States mail passing to and from California . Well founded apprehensions are now entertained that the Indians and wandering Mexicans , equally lawless , may break up the important stage and postal communication recently established between our Atlantic and Pacific possessions . This passes very near to the Mexican boundary throughout the whole length of Arizona . I can imagine no possible remedy for these evils and no mode of restoring law and order on that remote and unsettled frontier but for the Government of the United States to assume a temporary protectorate over the northern portions of Chihuahua and Sonora and to establish military posts within the same and this I earnestly recommend to Congress . This protection may be withdrawn as soon as local governments shall be established in these Mexican States capable of performing their duties to the United States , restraining the lawless , and preserving peace along the border . I do not doubt that this measure will be viewed in a friendly spirit by the governments and people of Chihuahua and Sonora , as it will prove equally effectual for the protection of their citizens on that remote and lawless frontier as for citizens of the United States . And in this connection permit me to recall your attention to the condition of Arizona . The population of that Territory , numbering , as is alleged , more than 10 , 000 souls , are practically without a government , without laws , and without any regular administration of justice . Murder and other crimes are committed with impunity . This state of things calls loudly for redress , and I therefore repeat my recommendation for the establishment of a Territorial government over Arizona . The political condition of the narrow isthmus of Central America , through which transit routes pass between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , presents a subject of deep interest to all commercial nations . It is over these transits that a large proportion of the trade and travel between the European and Asiatic continents is destined to pass . To the United States these routes are of incalculable importance as a means of communication between their Atlantic and Pacific possessions . The latter now extend throughout seventeen degrees of latitude on the Pacific coast , embracing the important State of California and the flourishing territories of Oregon and Washington . All commercial nations therefore have a deep and direct interest that these communications shall be rendered secure from interruption . If an arm of the sea connecting the two oceans penetrated through Nicaragua and Costa Rica , it could not be pretended that these States would have the right to arrest or retard its navigation to the injury of other nations . The transit by land over this narrow isthmus occupies nearly the same position . It is a highway in which they themselves have little interest when compared with the vast interests of the rest of the world . Whilst their rights of sovereignty ought to be respected , it is the duty of other nations to require that this important passage shall not be interrupted by the civil wars and revolutionary outbreaks which have so frequently occurred in that region . The stake is too important to be left at the mercy of rival companies claiming to hold conflicting contracts with Nicaragua . The commerce of other nations is not to stand still and await the adjustment of such petty controversies . The Government of the United States expect no more than this , and they will not be satisfied with less . They would not , if they could , derive any advantage from the Nicaragua transit not common to the rest of the World . Its neutrality and protection for the common use of all nations is their only object . They have no objection that Nicaragua shall demand and receive a fair compensation from the companies and individuals who may traverse the route , but they insist that it shall never hereafter be closed by an arbitrary decree of that Government . If disputes arise between it and those with whom they may have entered into contracts , these must be adjusted by some fair tribunal provided for the purpose , and the route must not be closed pending the controversy . This is our whole policy , and it can not fail to be acceptable to other nations . All these difficulties might be avoided if , consistently with the good faith of Nicaragua , the use of this transit could be thrown open to general competition , providing at the same time for the payment of a reasonable rate to the Nicaraguan Government on passengers and freight . In August , 1852 , the Accessory Transit Company made its first interoceanic trip over the Nicaraguan route , and continued in successful operation , with great advantage to the public , until the 18th February , 1856 , when it was closed and the grant to this company as well as its charter were summarily and arbitrarily revoked by the Government of President Rivas . Previous to this date , however , in 1854 , serious disputes concerning the settlement of their accounts had arisen between the company and the Government , threatening the interruption of the route at any moment . These the United States in vain endeavored to compose . It would be useless to narrate the various proceedings which took place between the parties up till the time when the transit was discontinued . Suffice it to say that since February , 1856 , it has remained closed , greatly to the prejudice of citizens of the United States . Since that time the competition has ceased between the rival routes of Panama and Nicaragua , and in consequence thereof an unjust and unreasonable amount has been exacted from our citizens for their passage to and from CaliforniaA treaty was signed on the 16th day of November , 1857 , by the Secretary of State and minister of Nicaragua , under the stipulations of which the use and protection of the transit route would have been secured , not only to the United States , but equally to all other nations . How and on what pretext this treaty has failed to receive the ratification of the Nicaraguan Government will appear by the papers herewith communicated from the State Department . The principal objection seems to have been to the provision authorizing the United States to employ force to keep the route open in case Nicaragua should fail to perform her duty in this respect . From the feebleness of that Republic , its frequent changes of government , and its constant internal dissensions , this had become a most important stipulation , and one essentially necessary , not only for the security of the route , but for the safety of American citizens passing and repassing to and from our Pacific possessions . Were such a stipulation embraced in a treaty between the United States and Nicaragua , the knowledge of this fact would of itself most probably prevent hostile parties from committing aggressions on the route , and render our actual interference for its protection unnecessary . The executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign nations is limited to the employment of diplomacy alone . When this fails it can proceed no further . It can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of Congress , except in resisting and repelling hostile attacks . It would have no authority to enter the territories of Nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the lives and property of our own citizens on their passage . It is true that on a sudden emergency of this character the President would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to their relief , but in doing this he would act upon his own responsibility . Under these circumstances I earnestly recommend to Congress the passage of an act authorizing the president , under such restrictions as they may deem proper , to employ the land and naval forces of the United States in preventing the transit from being obstructed or closed by lawless violence , and in protecting the lives and property of American citizens traveling thereupon , requiring at the same time that these forces shall be withdrawn the moment the danger shall have passed away . Without such a provision our citizens will be constantly exposed to interruption in their progress and to lawless violence . A similar necessity exists for the passage of such an act for the protection of the Panama and Tehuantepec routes . In reference to the Panama route , the United States , by their existing treaty with New Granada , expressly guarantee the neutrality of the Isthmus , with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupted or embarrassed in any future time while this treaty exists . In regard to the Tehuantepec route , which has been recently opened under the most favorable auspices , our treaty with Mexico of the 30th December , 1853 , secures to the citizens of the United States a right of transit over it for their persons and merchandise and stipulates that neither Government shall interpose any obstacle thereto . It also concedes to the United States the right to transport across the Isthmus , in closed bags , the mails of the United States not intended for distribution along the line of the communication also the effects of the United States Government and its citizens which may be intended for transit and not for distribution on the Isthmus , free of custom house or other charges by the Mexican Government . These treaty stipulations with New Granada and Mexico , in addition to the considerations applicable to the Nicaragua route , seem to require legislation for the purpose of carrying them into effect . The injuries which have been inflicted upon our citizens in Costa Rica and Nicaragua during the last two or three years have received the prompt attention of this Government . Some of these injuries were of the most aggravated character . The transaction at Virgin Bay in April , 1856 , when a company of unarmed Americans , who were in no way connected with any belligerent conduct or party , were fired upon by the troops of Costa Rica and numbers of them killed and wounded , was brought to the knowledge of Congress by my predecessor soon after its occurrence , and was also presented to the Government of Costa Rica for that immediate investigation and redress which the nature of the case demanded . A similar course was pursued with reference to other outrages in these countries , some of which were hardly less aggravated in their character than the transaction at Virgin Bay . At the time , however , when our present minister to Nicaragua was appointed , in December , 1857 , no redress had been obtained for any of these wrongs and no reply even had been received to the demands which had been made by this Government upon that of Costa Rica more than a year before . Our minister was instructed , therefore , to lose no time in expressing to those Governments the deep regret with which the President had witnessed this inattention to the just claims of the United States and in demanding their prompt and satisfactory adjustment . Unless this demand shall be complied with at an early day it will only remain for this Government to adopt such other measures as may be necessary in order to obtain for itself that justice which it has in vain attempted to secure by peaceful means from the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica . While it has shown , and will continue to show , the most sincere regard for the rights and honor of these Republics , it can not permit this regard to be met by an utter neglect on their part of what is due to the Government and citizens of the United States . Against New Granada we have long standing causes of complaint , arising out of the unsatisfied claims of our citizens upon that Republic , and to these have been more recently added the outrages committed upon our citizens at Panama in April , 1856 . A treaty for the adjustment of these difficulties was concluded by the Secretary of State and the minister of New Granada in September , 1857 , which contained just and acceptable provisions for that purpose . This treaty was transmitted to Bogota and was ratified by the Government of New Granada , but with certain amendments . It was not , however , returned to this city until after the close of the last session of the Senate . It will be immediately transmitted to that body for their advice and consent , and should this be obtained it will remove all our existing causes of complaint against New Granada on the subject of claims . Questions have arisen between the two Governments as to the right of New Granada to levy a tonnage duty upon the vessels of the United States in its ports of the Isthmus and to levy a passenger tax upon our citizens arriving in that country , whether with a design to remain there or to pass from ocean to ocean by the transit route and also a tax upon the mail of the United States transported over the Panama Railroad . The Government of New Granada has been informed that the United States would consider the collection of either of these taxes as an act in violation of the treaty between the two countries , and as such would be resisted by the United States . At the same time , we are prepared to discuss these questions in a spirit of amity and justice and with a sincere desire to adjust them in a satisfactory manner . A negotiation for that purpose has already been commenced . No effort has recently been made to collect these taxes nor is any anticipated under present circumstances . With the Empire of Brazil our relations are of the most friendly character . The productions of the two countries , and especially those of an agricultural nature , are such as to invite extensive mutual exchanges . A large quantity of American flour is consumed in Brazil , whilst more than treble the amount in value of Brazilian coffee is consumed in the United States . Whilst this is the case , a heavy duty has been levied until very recently upon the importation of American flour into Brazil . I am gratified , however , to be able to inform you that in September last this has been reduced from 1 . 32 to about 49 cents per barrel , and the duties on other articles of our production have been diminished in nearly the same proportion . I regret to state that the Government of Brazil still continues to levy an export duty of about 11 per cent on coffee , notwithstanding this article is admitted free from duty in the United States . This is a heavy charge upon the consumers of coffee in our country , as we purchase half of the entire surplus crop of that article raised in Brazil . Our minister , under instructions , will reiterate his efforts to have this export duty removed , and it is hoped that the enlightened Government of the Emperor will adopt this wise , just , and equal policy . In that event , there is good reason to believe that the commerce between the two countries will greatly increase , much to the advantage of both . The claims of our citizens against the Government of Brazil are not in the aggregate of very large amount but some of these rest upon plain principles of justice and their settlement ought not to be longer delayed . A renewed and earnest , and I trust a successful , effort will be made by our minister to procure their final adjustment . On the 2d of June last Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the President to adopt such measures and use such force as in his judgment may be necessary and advisable for the the purpose of the differences between the United States and the Republic of Paraguay , in connection with the attack on the United States steamer Water Witch and with other measures referred to in his annual message , and on the 12th of July following they made an appropriation to defray the expenses and compensation of a commissioner to that Republic should the President deem it proper to make such all appointment . In compliance with these enactments , I have appointed a commissioner , who has proceeded to Paraguay with full powers and instructions to settle these differences in an amicable and peaceful manner if this be practicable . His experience and discretion justify the hope that he may prove successful in convincing the Paraguayan Government that it is due both to honor and justice that they should voluntarily and promptly make atonement for the wrongs which they have committed against the United States and indemnify our injured citizens whom they have forcibly despoiled of their property . Should our commissioner prove unsuccessful after a sincere and earnest effort to accomplish the object of his mission , then no alternative will remain but the employment of force to obtain just satisfaction from Paraguay . In view of this contingency , the Secretary of the Navy , under my direction , has fitted out and dispatched a naval force to rendezvous near Buenos Ayres , which , it is believed , will prove sufficient for the occasion . It is my earnest desire , however , that it may not be found necessary to resort to this last alternative . When Congress met in December last the business of the country had just been crushed by one of those periodical revulsions which are the inevitable consequence of our unsound and extravagant system of bank credits and inflated currency . With all the elements of national wealth in abundance , our manufactures were suspended , our useful public and private enterprises were arrested , and thousands of laborers were deprived of employment and reduced to want . Universal distress prevailed among the commercial , manufacturing , and mechanical classes . This revulsion was felt the more severely in the United States because similar causes had produced the like deplorable effects throughout the commercial nations of Europe . All were experiencing sad reverses at the same moment . Our manufacturers everywhere suffered severely , not because of the recent reduction in the tariff of duties on imports , but because there was no demand at any price for their productions . The people were obliged to restrict themselves in their purchases to articles of prime necessity . In the general prostration of business the iron manufacturers in different States probably suffered more than any other class , and much destitution was the inevitable consequence among the great number of workmen who had been employed in this useful branch of industry . There could be no supply where there was no demand . To present an example , there could be no demand for railroad iron after our magnificent system of railroads , extending its benefits to every portion of the Union , had been brought to a dead pause . The same consequences have resulted from similar causes to many other branches of useful manufactures . It is self evident that where there is no ability to purchase manufactured articles these can not be sold , and consequently must cease to be produced . No government , and especially a government of such limited powers as that of the United States , could have prevented the late revulsion . The whole commercial world seemed for years to have been rushing to this catastrophe . The same ruinous consequences would have followed in the United States whether the duties upon foreign imports had remained as they were under the tariff of 1846 or had been raised to a much higher standard . The tariff of 1857 had no agency in the result . The general causes existing throughout the world could not have been controlled by the legislation of any particular country . The periodical revulsions which have existed in our past history must continue to return at intervals so long as our present unbounded system of bank credits shall prevail . They will , however , probably be the less severe in future , because it is not to be expected , at least for many years to come , that the commercial nations of Europe , with whose interests our own are so materially involved , will expose themselves to similar calamities . But this subject was treated so much at large in my last annual message that I shall not now pursue it further . Still , I respectfully renew the recommendation in favor of the passage of a uniform bankrupt law applicable to banking institutions . This is all the direct power over the subject which I believe the Federal Government possesses . Such a law would mitigate , though it might not prevent , the evil . The instinct of self preservation might produce a wholesome restraint upon their banking business if they knew in advance that a suspension of specie payments would inevitably produce their civil death . But the effects of the revulsion are now slowly but surely passing away . The energy and enterprise of our citizens , with our unbounded resources , will within the period of another year restore a state of wholesome industry and trade . Capital has again accumulated in our large cities . The rate of interest is there very low . Confidence is gradually reviving , and so soon as it is discovered that this capital can be profitably employed in commercial and manufacturing enterprises and in the construction of railroads and other works of public and private improvement prosperity will again smile throughout the land . It is vain , however , to disguise the fact from ourselves that a speculative inflation of our currency without a corresponding inflation in other countries whose manufactures come into competition with our own must ever produce disastrous results to our domestic manufactures . No tariff short of absolute prohibition can prevent these evil consequences . In connection with this subject it is proper to refer to our financial condition . The same causes which have produced pecuniary distress throughout the country have so reduced the amount of imports from foreign countries that the revenue has proved inadequate to meet the necessary expenses of the Government . To supply the deficiency , Congress , by the act of December 23 , 1857 , authorized the issue of 20 , 000 , 000 of Treasury notes and this proving inadequate , they authorized , by the act of June 14 , 1858 , a loan of 20 , 000 , 000 , to be applied to the payment of appropriations made by law . No statesman would advise that we should go on increasing the national debt to meet the ordinary expenses of the Government . This would be a most ruinous policy . In case of war our credit must be our chief resource , at least for the first year , and this would be greatly impaired by having contracted a large debt in time of peace . It is our true policy to increase our revenue so as to equal our expenditures . It would be ruinous to continue to borrow . Besides , it may be proper to observe that the incidental protection thus afforded by a revenue tariff would at the present moment to some extent increase the confidence of the manufacturing interests and give a fresh impulse to our reviving business . To this surely no person will object . In regard to the mode of assessing and collecting duties under a strictly revenue tariff , I have long entertained and often expressed the opinion that sound policy requires this should be done by specific duties in cases to which these can be properly applied . They are well adapted to commodities which are usually sold by weight or by measure , and which from their nature are of equal or of nearly equal value . Such , for example , are the articles of iron of different classes , raw sugar , and foreign wines and spirits . In my deliberate judgment specific duties are the best , if not the only , means of securing the revenue against false and fraudulent invoices , and such has been the practice adopted for this purpose by other commercial nations . Besides , specific duties would afford to the American manufacturer the incidental advantages to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff . The present system is a sliding scale to his disadvantage . Under it , when prices are high and business prosperous , the duties rise in amount when he least requires their aid . On the contrary , when prices fall and he is struggling against adversity , the duties are diminished in the same proportion , greatly to his injury . Neither would there be danger that a higher rate of duty than that intended by Congress could be levied in the form of specific duties . It would be easy to ascertain the average value of any imported article for a series of years , and , instead of subjecting it to an ad valorem duty at a certain rate per centum , to substitute in its place an equivalent specific duty . By such an arrangement the consumer would not be injured . It is true he might have to pay a little more duty on a given article in one year , but , if so , he would pay a little less in another , and in a series of years these would counterbalance each other and amount to the same thing so far as his interest is concerned . This inconvenience would be trifling when contrasted with the additional security thus afforded against frauds upon the revenue , in which every consumer is directly interested . I have thrown out these suggestions as the fruit of my own observation , to which Congress , in their better judgment , will give such weight as they may justly deserve . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will explain in detail the operations of that Department of the Government . The receipts into the Treasury from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1858 , including the Treasury notes authorized by the act of December 23 , 1857 , were 70 , 273 , 869 . 59 , which amount , with the balance of 17 , 710 , 114 . 27 remaining in the Treasury at the commencement of the year , made an aggregate for the service of the year of 87 , 983 , 983 . 86 . The public expenditures during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1858 , amounted to 81 , 585 , 667 . 76 , of which 9 , 684 , 537 . 99 were applied to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of Treasury notes with the interest thereon , leaving in the Treasury on July 1 , 1858 , being the commencement of the present fiscal year , 6 , 398 , 316 . 10 . The receipts into the Treasury during the first quarter of the present fiscal year , commencing the 1st of July , 1858 , including one half of the loan of 20 , 000 , 000 , with the premium upon it , authorized by the act of June 14 , 1858 , were 25 , 230 , 879 . 46 , and the estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters to the 30th of June , 1859 , from ordinary sources are 38 , 500 , 000 , making , with the balance before stated , an aggregate of 70 , 129 , 195 . 56 . The expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal year were 21 , 708 , 198 . 51 , of which 1 , 010 , 142 . 37 were applied to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of Treasury notes and the interest thereon . The estimated expenditures during the remaining three quarters to June 30 , 1859 , are 52 , 357 , 698 . 48 , making an aggregate of 74 , 065 , 896 . 99 , being an excess of expenditure beyond the estimated receipts into the Treasury from ordinary sources during the fiscal year to the 30th of June , 1859 , of 3 , 936 , 701 . 43 . Extraordinary means are placed by law within the command of the Secretary of the Treasury , by the reissue of Treasury notes redeemed and by negotiating the balance of the loan authorized by the act of June 14 , 1858 , to the extent of 11 , 000 , 000 , which , if realized during the present fiscal year , will leave a balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July , 1859 , of 7 , 063 , 298 . 57 . The estimated receipts during the next fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1860 , are 62 , 000 , 000 , which , with the above estimated balance of 7 , 063 , 298 . 57 make an aggregate for the service of the next fiscal year of 69 , 063 , 298 . 57 . The estimated expenditures during the next fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1860 , are 73 , 139 , 147 . 46 , which leaves a deficit of estimated means , compared with the estimated expenditures , for that year , commencing on July 1 , 1859 , of 4 , 075 , 848 . 89 . In addition to this sum the Postmaster General will require from the Treasury for the service of the Post Office Department 3 , 838 , 728 , as explained in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury , which will increase the estimated deficit on June 30 , 1860 , to 7 , 914 , 576 . 89 . To provide for the payment of this estimated deficiency , which will be increased by such appropriations as may be made by Congress not estimated for in the report of the Treasury Department , as well as to provide for the gradual redemption from year to year of the outstanding Treasury notes , the Secretary of the Treasury recommends such a revision of the present tariff as will raise the required amount . After what I have already said I need scarcely add that I concur in the opinion expressed in his report that the public debt should not be increased by an additional loan and would therefore strongly urge upon Congress the duty of making at their present session the necessary provision for meeting these liabilities . The public debt on July 1 , 1858 , the commencement of the present fiscal year , was 25 , 155 , 977 . 66 . During the first quarter of the present year the sum of 10 , 000 , 000 has been negotiated of the loan authorized by the act of June 14 , 1858 , making the present outstanding public debt , exclusive of Treasury notes , 35 , 155 , 977 . 66 . There was on the 1st of July , 1858 , of Treasury notes issued by authority of the act of December 23 , 1857 , unredeemed , the sum of 19 , 754 , 800 , making the amount of actual indebtedness at that date 54 , 910 , 777 . 66 . To this will be added 10 , 000 , 000 during the present fiscal year , this being the remaining half of the loan of 20 , 000 , 000 not yet negotiated . The rapid increase of the public debt and the necessity which exists for a modification of the tariff to meet even the ordinary expenses of the Government ought to admonish us all , in our respective spheres of duty , to the practice of rigid economy . The objects of expenditure should be limited in number , as far as this may be practicable , and the appropriations necessary to carry them into effect ought to be disbursed under the strictest accountability . Enlightened economy does not consist in the refusal to appropriate money for constitutional purposes essential to the defense , progress , and prosperity of the Republic , but in taking care that none of this money shall be wasted by mismanagement in its application to the objects designated by law . Comparisons between the annual expenditure at the present time and what it was ten or twenty years ago are altogether fallacious . The rapid increase of our country in extent and population renders a corresponding increase of expenditure to some extent unavoidable . This is constantly creating new objects of expenditure and augmenting the amount required for the old . The true questions , then , are , Have these objects been unnecessarily multiplied , or has the amount expended upon any or all of them been larger than comports with due economy In accordance with these principles , the heads of the different Executive Departments of the Government have been instructed to reduce their estimates for the next fiscal year to the lowest standard consistent with the efficiency of the service , and this duty they have performed in a spirit of just economy . The estimates of the Treasury , War , Navy , and Interior Departments have each been in some degree reduced , and unless a sudden and unforeseen emergency should arise it is not anticipated that a deficiency will exist in either within the present or the next fiscal year . The Post Office Department is placed in a peculiar position , different from the other Departments , and to this I shall hereafter refer . I invite Congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the expenses in all the Departments can not be still further reduced , and I promise them all the aid in my power in pursuing the investigation . I transmit herewith the reports made to me by the Secretaries of War , of the Navy , of the Interior , and of the Postmaster General . They each contain valuable information and important recommendations , to which I invite the attention of Congress . In my last annual message I took occasion to recommend the immediate construction of ten small steamers of light draft , for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the Navy . Congress responded to the recommendation by authorizing the construction of eight of them . The progress which has been made in executing this authority is stated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy . I concur with him in the opinion that a greater number of this class of vessels is necessary for the purpose of protecting in a more efficient manner the persons and property of American citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries , as well as in guarding more effectually our own coasts . I accordingly recommend the passage of an act for this purpose . The suggestions contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior , especially those in regard to the disposition of the public domain , the pension and bounty land system , the policy toward the Indians , and the amendment of our patent laws , are worthy of the serious consideration of Congress . The Post Office Department occupies a position very different from that of the other Departments . For many years it was the policy of the Government to render this a self sustaining Department and if this can not now be accomplished , in the present condition of the country , we ought to make as near an approach to it as may be practicable . The Postmaster General is placed in a most embarrassing position by the existing laws . He is obliged to carry these into effect . He has no other alternative . He finds , however , that this can not be done without heavy demands upon the Treasury over and above what is received for postage , and these have been progressively increasing from year to year until they amounted for the last fiscal year , ending on the 30th of June , 1858 , to more than 4 , 500 , 000 , whilst it is estimated that for the present fiscal year they will amount to 6 , 290 , 000 . These sums are exclusive of the annual appropriation of 700 , 000 for compensation for the mail service performed for the two Houses of Congress and the other Departments and officers of the Government in the transmission of free matter . The cause of these large deficits is mainly attributable to the increased expense of transporting the mails . In 1852 the sum paid for this service was but a fraction above four millions and a quarter . Since that year it has annually increased , until in 1858 it has reached more than eight millions and a quarter , and for the service of 1859 it is estimated that it will amount to more than 10 , 000 , 000 . The receipts of the Post Office Department can be made to approach or to equal its expenditure only by means of the legislation of Congress . In applying any remedy care should be taken that the people shall not be deprived of the advantages which they are fairly entitled to enjoy from the Post Office Department . The principal remedies recommended to the consideration of Congress by the Postmaster General are to restore the former rate of postage upon single letters to 5 cents to substitute for the franking privilege the delivery to those now entitled to enjoy it of post office stamps for their correspondence , and to direct the Department in making contracts for the transportation of the mail to confine itself to the payment of the sum necessary for this single purpose , without requiring it to be transported in post coaches or carriages of any particular description . Under the present system the expense to the Government is greatly increased by requiring that the mail shall be carried in such vehicles as will accommodate passengers . This will be done , without pay from the Department , over all roads where the travel will remunerate the contractors . These recommendations deserve the grave consideration of Congress . I would again call your attention to the construction of a Pacific railroad . Time and reflection have but served to confirm me in the truth and justice of the observations which I made on this subject in my last annual message , to which I beg leave respectfully to refer . It is freely admitted that it would be inexpedient for this Government to exercise the power of constructing the Pacific railroad by its own immediate agents . Such a policy would increase the patronage of the Executive to a dangerous extent , and introduce a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of Federal officials could either prevent or detect . This can only be done by the keen eye and active and careful supervision of individual and private interest . The construction of this road ought therefore to be committed to companies incorporated by the States or other agencies whose pecuniary interests would be directly involved . Congress might then assist them in the work by grants of land or of money , or both , under such conditions and restrictions as would secure the transportation of troops and munitions of war free from any charge and that of the United States mail at a fair and reasonable price . The progress of events since the commencement of your last session has shown how soon difficulties disappear before a firm and determined resolution . At that time such a road was deemed by wise and patriotic men to be a visionary project . The great distance to be overcome and the intervening mountains and deserts in the way were obstacles which , in the opinion of many , could not be surmounted . Now , after the lapse of but a single year , these obstacles , it has been discovered , are far less formidable than they were supposed to be , and mail stages with passengers now pass and repass regularly twice in each week , by a common wagon road , between San Francisco and Louis and Memphis in less than twenty five days . The service has been as regularly performed as it was in former years between New York and this city . Whilst disclaiming all authority to appropriate money for the construction of this road , except that derived from the war making power of the Constitution , there are important collateral considerations urging us to undertake the work as speedily as possible . The first and most momentous of these is that such a road would be a powerful bond of union between the States east and west of the Rocky Mountains . This is so self evident as to require no illustration . But again , in a commercial point of view , I consider this the great question of the day . With the eastern front of our Republic stretching along the Atlantic and its western front along the Pacific , if all the parts should be united by a safe , easy , and rapid intercommunication we must necessarily command a very large proportion of the trade both of Europe and Asia . Our recent treaties with China and Japan will open these rich and populous Empires to our commerce and the history of the world proves that the nation which has gained possession of the trade with eastern Asia has always become wealthy and powerful . The peculiar geographical position of California and our Pacific possessions invites American capital and enterprise into this fruitful field . To reap the rich harvest , however , it is an indispensable prerequisite that we shall first have a railroad to convey and circulate its products throughout every portion of the Union . Besides , such a railroad through our temperate latitude , which would not be impeded by the frosts and snows of winter nor by the tropical heats of summer , would attract to itself much of the travel and the trade of all nations passing between Europe and Asia . On the 21st of August last Lieutenant Maffit , of the United States brig Dolphin , captured the slaver Echo formerly the Putnam , of New Orleans near Kay Verde , on the coast of Cuba , with more than 300 African negroes on board . The prize , under the command of Lieutenant Bradford , of the United States Navy , arrived at Charleston on the 27th August , when the negroes , 306 in number , were delivered into the custody of the United States marshal for the district of South Carolina . They were first placed in Castle Pinckney , and afterwards in Fort Sumter , for safe keeping , and were detained there until the 19th September , when the survivors , 271 in number , were delivered on board the United States steamer Niagara to be transported to the coast of Africa under the charge of the agent of the United States , pursuant to the provisions of the act of the 3d March , 1819 , in addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade . Under the second section of this act the President is authorized to make such regulations and arrangements as he may deem expedient for the safe keeping , support , and removal beyond the limits of the United States of all such negroes , mulattoes , or persons of color captured by vessels of the United States as may be delivered to the marshal of the district into which they are brought , and to appoint a proper person or persons residing upon the coast of Africa as agent or agents for receiving the negroes , mulattoes , or persons of color delivered from on board vessels seized in the prosecution of the slave trade by commanders of United States armed vessels . A doubt immediately arose as to the true construction of this act . It is quite clear from its terms that the President was authorized to provide for the safe keeping , support , and removal of these negroes up till the time of their delivery to the agent on the coast of Africa , but no express provision was made for their protection and support after they had reached the place of their destination . Still , an agent was to be pointed to receive them in Africa , and it could not have been supposed that Congress intended he should desert them at the moment they were received and turn them loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victims of the slave trade . Had this been the intention of Congress , the employment of an agent to receive them , who is required to reside on the coast , was unnecessary , and they might have been landed by our vessels anywhere in Africa and left exposed to the sufferings and the fate which would certainly await them . Monroe , in his special message of December 17 , 1819 , at the first session after the act was passed , announced to Congress what in his opinion was its true construction . He believed it to be his duty under it to follow these unfortunates into Africa and make provision for them there until they should be able to provide for themselves . In communicating this interpretation of the act to Congress he stated that some doubt had been entertained as to its true intent and meaning , and he submitted the question to them so that they might , should it be deemed advisable , amend the same before further proceedings are had under it . Nothing was done by Congress to explain the act , and Monroe proceeded to carry it into execution according to his own interpretation . This , then , became the practical construction . When the Africans from on board the Echo were delivered to the marshal at Charleston , it became my duty to consider what disposition ought to be made of them under the law . For many reasons it was expedient to remove them from that locality as speedily as possible . Although the conduct of the authorities and citizens of Charleston in giving countenance to the execution of the law was just what might have been expected from their high character , yet a prolonged continuance of 300 Africans in the immediate vicinity of that city could not have failed to become a source of inconvenience and anxiety to its inhabitants . Where to send them was the question . There was no portion of the coast of Africa to which they could be removed with any regard to humanity except to Liberia . Under these circumstances an agreement was entered into with the Colonization Society on the 7th of September last , a copy of which is herewith transmitted , under which the society engaged , for the consideration of 45 , 000 , to receive these Africans in Liberia from the agent of the United States and furnish them during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter , clothing , provisions , and medical attendance , causing the children to receive schooling , and all , whether children or adults , to be instructed in the arts of civilized life suitable to their condition . This aggregate of 45 , 000 was based upon an allowance of 150 for each individual and as there has been considerable mortality among them and may be more before they reach Africa , the society have agreed , in an equitable spirit , to make such a deduction from the amount as under the circumstances may appear just and reasonable . This can not be fixed until we shall ascertain the actual number which may become a charge to the society . It was also distinctly agreed that under no circumstances shall this Government be called upon for any additional expenses . The agents of the society manifested a laudable desire to conform to the wishes of the Government throughout the transaction . They assured me that after a careful calculation they would be required to expend the sum of 150 on each individual in complying with the agreement , and they would have nothing left to remunerate them for their care , trouble , and responsibility . At all events , I could make no better arrangement , and there was no other alternative . During the period when the Government itself , through its own agents , undertook the task of providing for captured negroes in Africa the cost per head was very much greater . There having been no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose , I could not advance any money on the agreement . I therefore recommend that an appropriation may be made of the amount necessary to carry it into effect . Other captures of a similar character may , and probably will , be made by our naval forces , and I earnestly recommend that Congress may amend the second section of the act of March 3 , 1819 , so as to free its construction from the ambiguity which has so long existed and render the duty of the President plain in executing its provisions . I recommend to your favorable regard the local interests of the District of Columbia . As the residence of Congress and the Executive Departments of the Government , we can not fail to feel a deep concern in its welfare . This is heightened by the high character and the peaceful and orderly conduct of its resident inhabitants . I can not conclude without performing the agreeable duty of expressing my gratification that Congress so kindly responded to the recommendation of my last annual message by affording me sufficient time before the close of their late session for the examination of all the bills presented to me for approval . This change in the practice of Congress has proved to be a wholesome reform . It exerted a beneficial influence on the transaction of legislative business and elicited the general approbation of the country . It enabled Congress to adjourn with that dignity and deliberation so becoming to the representatives of this great Republic , without having crowded into general appropriation bills provisions foreign to their nature and of doubtful constitutionality and expediency . Let me warmly and strongly commend this precedent established by themselves as a guide to their proceedings during the present session .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States I return with my objections to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , the bill entitled An act donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts , presented to me on the 18th instant . This bill makes a donation to the several States of 20 , 000 acres of the public lands for each Senator and Representative in the present Congress , and also an additional donation of 20 , 000 acres for each additional Representative to which any State may be entitled under the census of 1860 . According to a report from the Interior Department , based upon the present number of Senators and Representatives , the lands given to the States amount to 6 , 060 , 000 acres , and their value , at the minimum Government price of 1 . 25 per acre , to 7 , 575 , 000 . The object of this gift , as stated by the bill , is the endowment , support , and maintenance of at least one college in each State where the leading object shall be , without excluding other scientific or classical studies , to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts , as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe , in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life . As there does not appear from the bill to be any beneficiaries in existence to which this endowment can be applied , each State is required to provide , within five years at least , not less than one college , or the grant to said State shall cease . In that event the said State shall be bound to pay the United States the amount received of any lands previously sold , and that the title to purchasers under the State shall be valid . The grant in land itself is confined to such States as have public lands within their limits worth 1 . 25 per acre in the opinion of the governor . For the remaining States the Secretary of the Interior is directed to issue land scrip to the amount of their distributive shares in acres under the provisions of this act , said scrip to be sold by said States , and the proceeds thereof applied to the uses and purposes prescribed in this act , and for no other use or purpose whatsoever . The lands are granted and the scrip is to be issued in sections or subdivisions of sections of not less than one quarter of a section . According to an estimate from the Interior Department , the number of acres which will probably be accepted by States having public lands within their own limits will not exceed 580 , 000 acres and it may be much less , leaving a balance of 5 , 480 , 000 acres to be provided for by scrip . These grants of land and land scrip to each of the thirty three States are made upon certain conditions , the principal of which is that if the fund shall be lost or diminished on account of unfortunate investments or otherwise the deficiency shall be replaced and made good by the respective States . I shall now proceed to state my objections to this bill . I deem it to be both inexpedient and unconstitutional . 1 . This bill has been passed at a period when we can with great difficulty raise sufficient revenue to sustain the expenses of the Government . Should it become a law the Treasury will be deprived of the whole , or nearly the whole , of our income from the sale of public lands , which for the next fiscal year has been estimated at 5 , 000 , 000 . A bare statement of the case will make this evident . The minimum price at which we dispose of our lands is 1 . 25 per acre . At the present moment , however , the price has been reduced to those who purchase the bounty land warrants of the old soldiers to 85 cents per acre , and of these warrants there are still outstanding and unlocated , as appears by a report February 12 , 1859 from the General Land Office , the amount of 11 , 990 , 391 acres . This has already greatly reduced the current sales by the Government and diminished the revenue from this source . If in addition thirty three States shall enter the market with their land scrip , the price must be greatly reduced below even 85 cents per acre , as much to the prejudice of the old soldiers who have not already parted with their land warrants as to Government . It is easy to perceive that with this glut of the market Government can sell little or no lands at 1 . 25 per acre , when the price of bounty land warrants and scrip shall be reduced to half this sum . This source of revenue will be almost entirely dried up . Under the bill the States may sell their land scrip at any price it may bring . There is no limitation whatever in this respect . Indeed , they must sell for what the scrip will bring , for without this fund they can not proceed to establish their colleges within the five years to which they are limited . It is manifest , therefore , that to the extent to which this bill will prevent the sale of public lands at 1 . 25 per acre , to that amount it will have precisely the same effect upon the Treasury as if we should impose a tax to create a loan to endow these State colleges . Surely the present is the most unpropitious moment which could have been selected for the passage of this bill . 2 . Waiving for the present the question of constitutional power , what effect will this bill have on the relations established between the Federal and State Governments The Constitution is a grant to Congress of a few enumerated but most important powers , relating chiefly to war , peace , foreign and domestic commerce , negotiation , and other subjects which can be best or alone exercised beneficially by the common Government . All other powers are reserved to the States and to the people . For the efficient and harmonious working of both , it is necessary that their several spheres of action should be kept distinct from each other . This alone can prevent conflict and mutual injury . Should the time ever arrive when the State governments shall look to the Federal Treasury for the means of supporting themselves and maintaining their systems of education and internal policy , the character of both Governments will be greatly deteriorated . The representatives of the States and of the people , feeling a more immediate interest in obtaining money to lighten the burdens of their constituents than for the promotion of the more distant objects intrusted to the Federal Government , will naturally incline to obtain means from the Federal Government for State purposes . If a question shall arise between an appropriation of land or money to carry into effect the objects of the Federal Government and those of the States , their feelings will be enlisted in favor of the latter . This is human nature and hence the necessity of keeping the two Governments entirely distinct . The preponderance of this home feeling has been manifested by the passage of the present bill . The establishment of these colleges has prevailed over the pressing wants of the common Treasury . No nation ever had such an inheritance as we possess in the public lands . These ought to be managed with the utmost care , but at the same time with a liberal spirit toward actual settlers . In the first year of a war with a powerful naval nation the revenue from customs must in a great degree cease . A resort to loans will then become necessary , and these can always be obtained , as our fathers obtained them , on advantageous terms by pledging the public lands as security . In this view of the subject it would be wiser to grant money to the States for domestic purposes than to squander away the public lands and transfer them in large bodies into the hands of speculators . A successful struggle on the part of the State governments with the General Government for the public lands would deprive the latter of the means of performing its high duties , especially at critical and dangerous periods . Besides , it would operate with equal detriment to the best interests of the States . It would remove the most wholesome of all restraints on legislative bodies that of being obliged to raise money by taxation from their constituents and would lead to extravagance , if not to corruption . What is obtained easily and without responsibility will be lavishly expended . 3 . This bill , should it become a law , will operate greatly to the injury of the new States . The progress of settlements and the increase of an industrious population owning an interest in the soil they cultivate are the causes which will build them up into great and flourishing commonwealths . Nothing could be more prejudicial to their interests than for wealthy individuals to acquire large tracts of the public land and hold them for speculative purposes . The low price to which this land scrip will probably be reduced will tempt speculators to buy it in large amounts and locate it on the best lands belonging to the Government . The eventual consequence must be that the men who desire to cultivate the soil will be compelled to purchase these very lands at rates much higher than the price at which they could be obtained from the Government . 4 . It is extremely doubtful , to say the least , whether this bill would contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the mechanic arts objects the dignity and value of which can not be too highly appreciated . The Federal Government , which makes the donation , has confessedly no constitutional power to follow it into the States and enforce the application of the fund to the intended objects . As donors we shall possess no control over our own gift after it shall have passed from our hands . It is true that the State legislatures are required to stipulate that they will faithfully execute the trust in the manner prescribed by the bill . But should they fail to do this , what would be the consequence The Federal Government has no power , and ought to have no power , to compel the execution of the trust . It would be in as helpless a condition as if , even in this , the time of great need , we were to demand any portion of the many millions of surplus revenue deposited with the States for safekeeping under the act of 1836 . 5 . This bill will injuriously interfere with existing colleges in the different States , in many of which agriculture is taught as a science and in all of which it ought to be so taught . These institutions of learning have grown up with the growth of the country , under the fostering care of the States and the munificence of individuals , to meet the advancing demands for education . They have proved great blessings to the people . Many , indeed most , of them are poor and sustain themselves with difficulty . What the effect will be on these institutions of creating an indefinite number of rival colleges sustained by the endowment of the Federal Government it is not difficult to determine . Under this bill it is provided that scientific and classical studies shall not be excluded from them . Indeed , it would be almost impossible to sustain them without such a provision , for no father would incur the expense of sending a son to one of these institutions for the sole purpose of making him a scientific farmer or mechanic . The bill itself negatives this idea , and declares that their object is to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life . This certainly ought to be the case . In this view of the subject it would be far better , if such an appropriation of land must be made to institutions of learning in the several States , to apply it directly to the establishment of professorships of agriculture and the mechanic arts in existing colleges , without the intervention of the State legislatures . It would be difficult to foresee how these legislatures will manage this fund . Each Representative in Congress for whose district the proportion of 20 , 000 acres has been granted will probably insist that the proceeds shall be expended within its limits . There will undoubtedly be a struggle between different localities in each State concerning the division of the gift , which may end in disappointing the hopes of the true friends of agriculture . For this state of things we are without remedy . Not so in regard to State colleges . We might grant land to these corporations to establish agricultural and mechanical professorships , and should they fail to comply with the conditions on which they accepted the grant we might enforce specific performance of these before the ordinary courts of justice . 6 . But does Congress possess the power under the Constitution to make a donation of public lands to the different States of the Union to provide colleges for the purpose of educating their own people I presume the general proposition is undeniable that Congress does not possess the power to appropriate money in the Treasury , raised by taxes on the people of the United States , for the purpose of educating the people of the respective States . It will not be pretended that any such power is to be found among the specific powers granted to Congress nor that it is necessary and proper for carrying into execution any one of these powers . Should Congress exercise such a power , this would be to break down the barriers which have been so carefully constructed in the Constitution to separate Federal from State authority . We should then not only lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises for Federal purposes , but for every State purpose which Congress might deem expedient or useful . This would be an actual consolidation of the Federal and State Governments so far as the great taxing and money power is concerned , and constitute a sort of partnership between the two in the Treasury of the United States , equally ruinous to both . But it is contended that the public lands are placed upon a different footing from money raised by taxation and that the proceeds arising from their sale are not subject to the limitations of the Constitution , but may be appropriated or given away by Congress , at its own discretion , to States , corporations , or individuals for any purpose they may deem expedient . The advocates of this bill attempt to sustain their position upon the language of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the Constitution , which declares that the Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States . They contend that by a fair interpretation of the words dispose of in this clause Congress possesses the power to make this gift of public lands to the States for purposes of education . It would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the framers of the Constitution , after having limited the powers of Congress to certain precise and specific objects , intended by employing the words dispose of to give that body unlimited power over the vast public domain . It would be a strange anomaly , indeed , to have created two funds the one by taxation , confined to the execution of the enumerated powers delegated to Congress , and the other from the public lands , applicable to all subjects , foreign and domestic , which Congress might designate that this fund should be disposed of , not to pay the debts of the United States , nor to raise and support armies , nor to provide and maintain a navy , nor to accomplish any one of the other great objects enumerated in the Constitution , but be diverted from them to pay the debts of the States , to educate their people , and to carry into effect any other measure of their domestic policy . This would be to confer upon Congress a vast and irresponsible authority , utterly at war with the well known jealousy of Federal power which prevailed at the formation of the Constitution . The natural intendment would be that as the Constitution confined Congress to well defined specific powers , the funds placed at their command , whether in land or money , should be appropriated to the performance of the duties corresponding with these powers . If not , a Government has been created with all its other powers carefully limited , but without any limitation in respect to the public lands . But I can not so read the words dispose of as to make them embrace the idea of giving away . The true meaning of words is always to be ascertained by the subject to which they are applied and the known general intent of the lawgiver . Congress is a trustee under the Constitution for the people of the United States to dispose of their public lands , and I think I may venture to assert with confidence that no case can be found in which a trustee in the position of Congress has been authorized to dispose of property by its owner where it has been held that these words authorized such trustee to give away the fund intrusted to his care . No trustee , when called upon to account for the disposition of the property placed under his management before any judicial tribunal , would venture to present such a plea in his defense . The true meaning of these words is clearly stated by Chief Justice Taney in delivering the opinion of the court 19 Howard , p . 436 . He says in reference to this clause of the Constitution It begins its enumeration of powers by that of disposing in other words , making sale of the lands or raising money from them , which , as we have already said , was the main object of the cession from the States , and which is the first thing provided for in the article . It is unnecessary to refer to the history of the times to establish the known fact that this statement of the Chief Justice is perfectly well rounded . That it never was intended by the framers of the Constitution that these lands should be given away by Congress is manifest from the concluding portion of the same clause . By it Congress has power not only to dispose of the territory , but of the other property of the United States . In the language of the Chief Justice p . 437 And the same power of making needful rules respecting the territory is in precisely the same language applied to the other property of the United States , associating the power over the territory in this respect with the power over movable or personal property that is , the ships , arms , or munitions of war which then belonged in common to the State sovereignties . The question is still clearer in regard to the public lands in the States and Territories within the Louisiana and Florida purchases . These lands were paid for out of the public Treasury from money raised by taxation . Now if Congress had no power to appropriate the money with which these lands were purchased , is it not clear that the power over the lands is equally limited The mere conversion of this money into land could not confer upon Congress new power over the disposition of land which they had not possessed over money . If it could , then a trustee , by changing the character of the fund intrusted to his care for special objects from money into land , might give the land away or devote it to any purpose he thought proper , however foreign from the trust . The inference is irresistible that this land partakes of the very same character with the money paid for it , and can be devoted to no objects different from those to which the money could have been devoted . If this were not the case , then by the purchase of a new territory from a foreign government out of the public Treasury Congress could enlarge their own powers and appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the land thus purchased , at their own discretion , to other and far different objects from what they could have applied the purchase money which had been raised by taxation . It has been asserted truly that Congress in numerous instances have granted lands for the purposes of education . These grants have been chiefly , if not exclusively , made to the new States as they successively entered the Union , and consisted at the first of one section and afterwards of two sections of the public land in each township for the use of schools , as well as of additional sections for a State university . Such grants are not , in my opinion , a violation of the Constitution . The United States is a great landed proprietor , and from the very nature of this relation it is both the right and the duty of Congress as their trustee to manage these lands as any other prudent proprietor would manage them for his own best advantage . Now no consideration could be presented of a stronger character to induce the American people to brave the difficulties and hardships of frontier life and to settle upon these lands and to purchase them at a fair price than to give to them and to their children an assurance of the means of education . If any prudent individual had held these lands , he could not have adopted a wiser course to bring them into market and enhance their value than to give a portion of them for purposes of education . As a mere speculation he would pursue this course . No person will contend that donations of land to all the States of the Union for the erection of colleges within the limits of each can be embraced by this principle . It can not be pretended that an agricultural college in New York or Virginia would aid the settlement or facilitate the sale of public lands in Minnesota or California . This can not possibly be embraced within the authority which a prudent proprietor of land would exercise over his own possessions . I purposely avoid any attempt to define what portions of land may be granted , and for what purposes , to improve the value and promote the settlement and sale of the remainder without violating the Constitution . In this case I adopt the rule that sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .<speech_sep>After a delay which has afforded me ample time for reflection , and after much and careful deliberation , I find myself constrained by an imperious sense of duty , as a coordinate branch of the Federal Government , to protest against the first two clauses of the first resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on the 5th instant , and published in the Congressional Globe on the succeeding day . These clauses are in the following words Resolved , That a committee of five members be appointed by the Speaker for the purpose , first , of investigating whether the President of the United States or any other officer of the Government has , by money , patronage , or other improper means , sought to influence the action of Congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State or Territory and , second , also to inquire into and investigate whether any officer or officers of the Government have , by combination or otherwise , prevented or defeated , or attempted to prevent or defeat , the execution of any law or laws now upon the statute book , and whether the President has failed or refused to compel the execution of any law thereof . I confine myself exclusively to these two branches of the resolution , because the portions of it which follow relate to alleged abuses in post offices , navy yards , public buildings , and other public works of the United States . In such cases inquiries are highly proper in themselves and belong equally to the Senate and the House , as incident to their legislative duties and being necessary to enable them to discover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedies for any abuses which may be ascertained . Although the terms of the latter portion of the resolution are extremely vague and general , yet my sole purpose in adverting to them at present is to mark the broad line of distinction between the accusatory and the remedial clauses of this resolution . The House of Representatives possess no power under the Constitution over the first or accusatory portion of the resolution except as an impeaching body , whilst over the last , in common with the Senate , their authority as a legislative body is fully and cheerfully admitted . It is solely in reference to the first or impeaching power that I propose to make a few observations . Except in this single case , the Constitution has invested the House of Representatives with no power , no jurisdiction , no supremacy whatever over the President . In all other respects he is quite as independent of them as they are of him . As a coordinate branch of the Government he is their equal . Indeed , he is the only direct representative on earth of the people of all and each of the sovereign States . To them , and to them alone , is he responsible whilst acting within the sphere of his constitutional duty , and not in any manner to the House of Representatives . The people have thought proper to invest him with the most honorable , responsible , and dignified office in the world , and the individual , however unworthy , now holding this exalted position , will take care , so far as in him lies , that their rights and prerogatives shall never be violated in his person , but shall pass to his successors unimpaired by the adoption of a dangerous precedent . He will defend them to the last extremity against any unconstitutional attempt , come from what quarter it may , to abridge the constitutional rights of the Executive and render him subservient to any human power except themselves . The people have not confined the President to the exercise of executive duties . They have also conferred upon him a large measure of legislative discretion . No bill can become a law without his approval , as representing the people of the United States , unless it shall pass after his veto by a majority of two thirds of both Houses . In his legislative capacity he might , in common with the Senate and the House , institute an inquiry to ascertain any facts which ought to influence his judgment in approving or vetoing any bill . This participation in the performance of legislative duties between the coordinate branches of the Government ought to inspire the conduct of all of them in their relations toward each other with mutual forbearance and respect . At least each has a right to demand justice from the other . The cause of complaint is that the constitutional rights and immunities of the Executive have been violated in the person of the President . The trial of an impeachment of the President before the Senate on charges preferred and prosecuted against him by the House of Representatives would be an imposing spectacle for the world . In the result not only his removal from the Presidential office would be involved , but , what is of infinitely greater importance to himself , his character , both in the eyes of the present and of future generations , might possibly be tarnished . The disgrace cast upon him would in some degree be reflected upon the character of the American people , who elected him . Hence the precautions adopted by the Constitution to secure a fair trial . On such a trial it declares that the Chief Justice shall preside . This was doubtless because the framers of the Constitution believed it to be possible that the Vice President might be biased by the fact that in case of the removal of the President from office the same shall devolve on the Vice President . The preliminary proceedings in the House in the case of charges which may involve impeachment have been well and wisely settled by long practice upon principles of equal justice both to the accused and to the people . The precedent established in the case of Judge Peck , of Missouri , in 1831 , after a careful review of all former precedents , will , I venture to predict , stand the test of time . In that case Luke Edward Lawless , the accuser , presented a petition to the House , in which he set forth minutely and specifically his causes of complaint . He prayed that the conduct and proceedings in this behalf of said Judge Peck may be inquired into by your honorable body , and such decision made thereon as to your wisdom and justice shall seem proper . This petition was referred to the Judiciary Committee such has ever been deemed the appropriate committee to make similar investigations . It is a standing committee , supposed to be appointed without reference to any special case , and at all times is presumed to be composed of the most eminent lawyers in the House from different portions of the Union , whose acquaintance with judicial proceedings and whose habits of investigation qualify them peculiarly for the task . No tribunal , from their position and character , could in the nature of things be more impartial . In the case of Judge Peck the witnesses were selected by the committee itself , with a view to ascertain the truth of the charge . They were cross examined by him , and everything was conducted in such a manner as to afford him no reasonable cause of complaint . In view of this precedent , and , what is of far greater importance , in view of the Constitution and the principles of eternal justice , in what manner has the President of the United States been treated by the House of Representatives John Covode , a Representative from Pennsylvania , is the accuser of the President . Instead of following the wise precedents of former times , and especially that in the case of Judge Peck , and referring the accusation to the Committee on the Judiciary , the House have made my accuser one of my judges . To make the accuser the judge is a violation of the principles of universal justice , and is condemned by the practice of all civilized nations . Every freeman must revolt at such a spectacle . I am to appear before Covode , either personally or by a substitute , to cross examine the witnesses which he may produce before himself to sustain his own accusations against me and perhaps even this poor boon may be denied to the President . And what is the nature of the investigation which his resolution proposes to institute It is as vague and general as the English language affords words in which to make it . The committee is to inquire , not into any specific charge or charges , but whether the President has , by money , patronage , or other improper means , sought to influence , not the action of any individual member or members of Congress , but the action of the entire body of Congress itself or any committee thereof . The President might have had some glimmering of the nature of . the offense to be investigated had his accuser pointed to the act or acts of Congress which he sought to pass or to defeat by the employment of money , patronage , or other improper means . But the accusation is bounded by no such limits . It extends to the whole circle of legislation to interference for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State or Territory . And what law does not appertain to the rights of some State or Territory And what law or laws has the President failed to execute These might easily have been pointed out had any such existed . Had Lawless asked an inquiry to be made by the House whether Judge Peck , in general terms , had not violated his judicial duties , without the specification of any particular act , I do not believe there would have been a single vote in that body in favor of the inquiry . Since the time of the star chamber and of general warrants there has been no such proceeding in England . The House of Representatives , the high impeaching power of the country , without consenting to hear a word of explanation , have indorsed this accusation against the President and made it their own act . They even refused to permit a Member to inquire of the President 39 s accuser what were the specific charges against him . Thus , in this preliminary accusation of high crimes and misdemeanors against a coordinate branch of the Government , under the impeaching power , the House refused to hear a single suggestion , even in regard to the correct mode of proceeding , but without a moment 39 s delay passed the accusatory resolutions under the pressure of the previous question . In the institution of a prosecution for any offense against the most humble citizen and I claim for myself no greater rights than he enjoys the constitutions of the United States and of the several States require that he shall be informed in the very beginning of the nature and cause of the accusation against him , in order to enable him to prepare for his defense . There are other principles which I might enumerate , not less sacred , presenting an impenetrable shield to protect every citizen falsely charged with a criminal offense . These have been violated in the prosecution instituted by the House of Representatives against the executive branch of the Government . Shall the President alone be deprived of the protection of these great principles which prevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrates the gloom of despotism Shall the Executive alone be deprived of rights which all his fellow citizens enjoy The whole proceeding against him justifies the fears of those wise and great men who , before the Constitution was adopted by the States , apprehended that the tendency of the Government was to the aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the executive and judicial departments . I again declare emphatically that I make this protest for no reason personal to myself , and I do it with perfect respect for the House of Representatives , in which I had the honor of serving as a member for five successive terms . I have lived long in this goodly land , and have enjoyed all the offices and honors which my country could bestow . Amid all the political storms through which I have passed , the present is the first attempt which has ever been made , to my knowledge , to assail my personal or official integrity and this as the time is approaching when I shall voluntarily retire from the service of my country . I feel proudly conscious that there is no public act of my life which will not bear the strictest scrutiny . I defy all investigation . Nothing but the basest perjury can sully my good name . I do not fear even this , because I cherish an humble confidence that the gracious Being who has hitherto defended and protected me against the shafts of falsehood and malice will not desert me now when I have become old and gray headed . I can declare before God and my country that no human being with an exception scarcely worthy of notice has at any period of my life dared to approach me with a corrupt or dishonorable proposition , and until recent developments it had never entered into my imagination that any person , even in the storm of exasperated political excitement , would charge me in the most remote degree with having made such a proposition to any human being . I may now , however , exclaim in the language of complaint employed by my first and greatest predecessor , that I have been abused in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a Nero , to a notorious defaulter , or even to a common pickpocket . I do therefore , for the reasons stated and in the name of the people of the several States , solemnly protest against these proceedings of the House of Representatives , because they are in violation of the rights of the coordinate executive branch of the Government and subversive of its constitutional independence because they are calculated to foster a band of interested parasites and informers , ever ready , for their own advantage , to swear before ex parte committees to pretended private conversations between the President and themselves , incapable from their nature of being disproved , thus furnishing material for harassing him , degrading him in the eyes of the country , and eventually , should he be a weak or a timid man , rendering him subservient to improper influences in order to avoid such persecutions and annoyances because they tend to destroy that harmonious action for the common good which ought to be maintained , and which I sincerely desire to cherish , between coordinate branches of the Government and , finally , because , if unresisted , they would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors , to whatever political party they might be attached .<speech_sep>
