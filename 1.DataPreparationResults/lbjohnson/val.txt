Speaker Barnes , Governor Hughes , Governor Smith , Congressman Kazen , Representative Graham , most distinguished legislators , ladies and gentlemen I deeply appreciate this opportunity to appear before an organization whose members contribute every day such important work to the public affairs of our State and of our country . This evening I came here to speak to you about Vietnam . I do not have to tell you that our people are profoundly concerned about that struggle . There are passionate convictions about the wisest course for our Nation to follow . There are many sincere and patriotic Americans who harbor doubts about sustaining the commitment that three Presidents and a half a million of our young men have made . Doubt and debate are enlarged because the problems of Vietnam are quite complex . They are a mixture of political turmoil of poverty of religious and factional strife of ancient servitude and modern longing for freedom . Vietnam is all of these things . Vietnam is also the scene of a powerful aggression that is spurred by an appetite for conquest . It is the arena where Communist expansionism is most aggressively at work in the world today where it is crossing international frontiers in violation of international agreements where it is killing and kidnaping where it is ruthlessly attempting to bend free people to its will . Into this mixture of subversion and war , of terror and hope , America has entered with its material power and with its moral commitment . Why Why should three Presidents and the elected representatives of our people have chosen to defend this Asian nation more than 10 , 000 miles from American shores We cherish freedom yes . We cherish self determination for all people yes . We abhor the political murder of any state by another , and the bodily murder of any people by gangsters of whatever ideology . And for 27 years since the days of lend lease we have sought to strengthen free people against domination by aggressive foreign powers . But the key to all that we have done is really our own security . At times of crisis before asking Americans to fight and die to resist aggression in a foreign land every American President has finally had to answer this question Is the aggression a threat not only to the immediate victim but to the United States of America and to the peace and security of the entire world of which we in America are a very vital part That is the question which Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson had to answer in facing the issue in Vietnam . That is the question that the Senate of the United States answered by a vote of 82 to 1 when it ratified and approved the SEATO treaty in 1955 , and to which the Members of the United States Congress responded in a resolution that it passed in 1964 by a vote of 504 to 2 , . . . the United States is , therefore , prepared , as the President determines , to take all necessary steps , including the use of armed force , to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom . Those who tell us now that we should abandon our commitment that securing South Vietnam from armed domination is not worth the price we are paying must also answer this question . And the test they must meet is this What would be the consequences of letting armed aggression against South Vietnam succeed What would follow in the time ahead What kind of world are they prepared to live in 5 months or 5 years from tonight For those who have borne the responsibility for decision during these past m years , the stakes to us have seemed clear and have seemed high . President Dwight Eisenhower said in 1959 Strategically , South Vietnam s capture by the Communists would bring their power several hundred miles into a hitherto free region . The remaining countries in Southeast Asia would be menaced by a great flanking movement . The freedom of 12 million people would be lost immediately , and that of 150 million in adjacent lands would be seriously endangered . The loss of South Vietnam would set in motion a crumbling process that could , as it progressed , have grave consequences for us and for freedom . . . . And President John Kennedy said in 1962 . . . withdrawal in the case of Vietnam and the case of Thailand might mean a cob lapse of the entire area . A year later , he reaffirmed that We are not going to withdraw from that effort . In my opinion , for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of South Vietnam , but Southeast Asia . So we are going to stay there , said President Kennedy . This is not simply an American viewpoint , I would have you legislative leaders know . I am going to call the roll now of those who live in that part of the world in the great arc of Asian and Pacific nations and who bear the responsibility for leading their people , and the responsibility for the fate of their people . The President of the Philippines had this to say Vietnam is the focus of attention now . . . . It may happen to Thailand or the Philippines , or anywhere , wherever there is misery , disease , ignorance . . . . For you to renounce your position of leadership in Asia is to allow the Red Chinese to gobble up all of Asia . The Foreign Minister of Thailand said The American decision will go down in history as the move that prevented the world from having to face another major conflagration . The Prime Minister of Australia said We are there because while Communist aggression persists the whole of Southeast Asia is threatened . President Park of Korea said For the first time in our history , we decided to dispatch our combat troops overseas . . . because in our belief any aggression against the Republic of Vietnam represented a direct and grave menace against the security and peace of free Asia , and therefore directly jeopardized the very security and freedom of our own people . The Prime Minister of Malaysia warned his people that if the United States pulled out of South Vietnam , it would go to the Communists , and after that , it would be only a matter of time until they moved against neighboring states . The Prime Minister of New Zealand said We can thank God that America at least regards aggression in Asia with the same concern as it regards aggression in Europe and is prepared to back up its concern with action . The Prime Minister of Singapore said I feel the fate of Asia South and Southeast Asia will be decided in the next few years by what happens in Vietnam . I cannot tell you tonight as your President with certainty that a Communist conquest of South Vietnam would be followed by a Communist conquest of Southeast Asia . But I do know there are North Vietnamese troops in Laos . I do know that there are North Vietnamese trained guerrillas tonight in northeast Thailand . I do know that there are Communist supported guerrilla forces operating in Burma . And a Communist coup was barely averted in Indonesia , the fifth largest nation in the world . So your American President cannot tell you with certainty that a Southeast Asia dominated by Communist . power would bring a third world war much closer to terrible reality . One could hope that this would not be so . But all that we have learned in this tragic century strongly suggests to me that it would be so . As President of the United States , I am not prepared to gamble on the chance that it is not so . I am not prepared to risk the security indeed , the survival of this American Nation on mere hope and wishful thinking . I am convinced that by seeing this struggle through now , we are greatly reducing the chances of a much larger war perhaps a nuclear war . I would rather stand in Vietnam , in our time , and by meeting this danger now , and facing up to it , thereby reduce the danger for our children and for our grandchildren . I want to turn now to the struggle in Vietnam itself . There are questions about this difficult war that must trouble every really thoughtful person . I am going to put some of these questions . And I am going to give you the very best answers that I can give you . First , are the Vietnamese with our help , and that of their other allies really making any progress Is there a forward movement The reports I see make it clear that there is . Certainly there is a positive movement toward constitutional government . Thus far the Vietnamese have met the political schedule that they laid down in January 1966 . The people wanted an elected , responsive government . They wanted it strongly enough to brave a vicious campaign of Communist terror and assassination to vote for it . It has been said that they killed more civilians in 4 weeks trying to keep them from voting before the election than our American bombers have killed in the big cities of North Vietnam in bombing military targets . On November 1 , subject to the action , of course , of the Constituent Assembly , an elected government will be inaugurated and an elected Senate and Legislature will be installed . Their responsibility is clear To answer the desires of the South Vietnamese people for self determination and for peace , for an attack on corruption , for economic development , and for social justice . There is progress in the war itself , steady progress considering the war that we are fighting rather dramatic progress considering the situation that actually prevailed when we sent our troops there in 1965 when we intervened to prevent the dismemberment of the country by the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese . The campaigns of the last year drove the enemy from many of their major interior bases . The military victory almost within Hanoi s grasp in 1965 has now been denied them . The grip of the Vietcong on the people is being broken . Since our commitment of major forces in July 1965 the proportion of the population living under Communist control has been reduced to well under 20 percent . Tonight the secure proportion of the population has grown from about 45 percent to 65 percent and in the contested areas , the tide continues to run with us . But the struggle remains hard . The South Vietnamese have suffered severely , as have we particularly in the First Corps area in the north , where the enemy has mounted his heaviest attacks , and where his lines of communication to North Vietnam are shortest . Our casualties in the war have reached about 13 , 500 killed in action , and about 85 , 000 wounded . Of those 85 , 000 wounded , we thank God that 79 , 000 of the 85 , 000 have been returned , or will return to duty shortly . Thanks to our great American medical science and the helicopter . I know there are other questions on your minds , and on the minds of many sincere , troubled Americans Why not negotiate now so many ask me . The answer is that we and our South Vietnamese allies are wholly prepared to negotiate tonight . I am ready to talk with Ho Chi Minh , and other chiefs of state concerned , tomorrow . I am ready to have Secretary Rusk meet with their foreign minister tomorrow . I am ready to send a trusted representative of America to any spot on this earth to talk in public or private with a spokesman of Hanoi . We have twice sought to have the issue of Vietnam dealt with by the United Nations and twice Hanoi has refused . Our desire to negotiate peace through the United Nations or out has been made very , very clear to Hanoi directly and many times through third parties . As we have told Hanoi time and time and time again , the heart of the matter is really this The United States is willing to stop all aerial and naval bombardment of North Vietnam when this will lead promptly to productive discussions . We , of course , assume that while discussions proceed , North Vietnam would not take advantage of the bombing cessation or limitation . But Hanoi has not accepted any of these proposals . So it is by Hanoi s choice and not ours , and not the rest of the world s that the war continues . Why , in the face of military and political progress in the South , and the burden of our bombing in the North , do they insist and persist with the war From many sources the answer is the same . They still hope that the people of the United States will not see this struggle through to the very end . As one Western diplomat reported to me only this week he had just been in Hanoi They believe their staying power is greater than ours and that they cannot lose . A visitor from a Communist capital had this to say They expect the war to be long , and that the Americans in the end will be defeated by a breakdown in morale , fatigue , and psychological factors . The Premier of North Vietnam said as far back as 1962 Americans do not like long , inconclusive war . . . . Thus we are sure to win in the end . Are the North Vietnamese right about us I think not . No . I think they are wrong . I think it is the common failing of totalitarian regimes that they cannot really understand the nature of our democracy They mistake dissent for disloyalty . They mistake restlessness for a rejection of policy . They mistake a few committees for a country . They misjudge individual speeches for public policy . They are no better suited to judge the strength and perseverance of America than the Nazi and the Stalinist propagandists were able to judge it . It is a tragedy that they must discover these qualities in the American people , and discover them through a bloody war . And , soon or late , they will discover them . In the meantime , it shall be our policy to continue to seek negotiations confident that reason will some day prevail that Hanoi will realize that it just can never win that it will turn away from fighting and start building for its own people . Since World War Ithis Nation has met and has mastered many challenges challenges in Greece and Turkey , in Berlin , in Korea , in Cuba . We met them because brave men were willing to risk their lives for their nation s security . And braver men have never lived than those who carry our colors in Vietnam at this very hour . The price of these efforts , of course , has been heavy . But the price of not having made them at all , not having seen them through , in my judgment would have been vastly greater . Our goal has been the same in Europe , in Asia , in our own hemisphere . It has been and it is now peace . And peace cannot be secured by wishes peace cannot be preserved by noble words and pure intentions . Enduring peace , Franklin Roosevelt said , cannot be bought at the cost of other people s freedom . The late President Kennedy put it precisely in November 1961 , when he said We are neither warmongers nor appeasers , neither hard nor soft . We are Americans determined to defend the frontiers of freedom by an honorable peace if peace is possible but by arms if arms are used against us . The true peace keepers in the world tonight are not those who urge us to retire from the field in Vietnam who tell us to try to find the quickest , cheapest exit from that tormented land , no matter what the consequences to us may be . The true peace keepers are those men who stand out there on the DMZ at this very hour , taking the worst that the enemy can give . The true peace keepers are the soldiers who are breaking the terrorist s grip around the villages of Vietnam the civilians who are bringing medical care and food and education to people who have already suffered a generation of war . And so I report to you that we are going to continue to press forward . Two things we must do . Two things we shall do . First , we must not mislead the enemy . Let him not think that debate and dissent will produce wavering and withdrawal . For I can assure you they will not . Let him not think that protests will produce surrender . Because they will not . Let him not think that he will wait us out . For he will not . Second , we will provide all that our brave men require to do the job that must be done . And that job is going to be done . These gallant men have our prayers have our thanks have our heart felt praise and our deepest gratitude . Let the world know that the keepers of peace will endure through every trial and that with the full backing of their countrymen , they are going to prevail .<speech_sep>We feel very strongly , Frank , that these men , who are military men , who are carrying out military assignments in line of duty against military targets , are not war criminals and should not be treated as such . We are ready , whenever the Hanoi government is ready , to sit down at a conference table under the sponsorship of the International Committee of the Red Cross , to discuss ways in which the Geneva Conventions of 1949 can be given fuller and more complete application in Vietnam . We think that the thought that these American boys have committed war crimes is deplorable and repulsive . Your Government has taken every step that it considers appropriate to see that proper representations on this subject have been made . The United States has made clear to the Government of India and to all other governments that at any time the Government of North Vietnam is willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss ways and means of obtaining peace in the world , that on a few hours notice the United States will be there . My closest representative is ready and willing and anxious at any time to enter into those discussions . I do not think that we should spend all of our time , though , examining what the Government of the United States might be willing to do without any regard to what the enemy might be willing to do . We have stated again and again our desire to engage in unconditional discussions and I repeat them again today . But we cannot talk about just half the war . We should talk about all the war , and we have not the slightest indication that the other side is willing to make any concession , to take any action that would lead to the peace table . And until there is some indication on their part , we , of course , would not expect to tie the hands of our men in Vietnam . Yes . Secretary Wirtz has made a statement , a rather strong statement , within the hour in connection with that controversy . The President has followed the law . We have taken every legal step that we could . We appointed and convened a very fair and judicious Board of distinguished Americans who heard testimony that runs into the hundreds of pages , made proper recommendations and drew appropriate conclusions , and submitted them to the President . My advisers examined those recommendations , and as President of this country , urged both labor and management to follow the Board s recommendations . The Board recommended that the airlines pay approximately an additional 76 million in increased wages and benefits . After some consideration , the management agreed to the Board s recommendations , but the union representatives refused . We have no legal remedies left to us in the Government . We have done all we can do under the law . We are continuing to persuade the management and labor people to continue their discussions . We are hopeful that they will continue those discussions and work around the clock , because the people of this country deserve to be served . While we have no law that can force the men to go back to work , I think the patience of the American people is being tried . And although the Government has done everything it can do to keep the mail moving , to serve the needs of defense , the time has come when a settlement is indicated . We would hope that the parties would continue to bargain until a decision is reached . We have had no indication that the government of Hanoi is open to any of the appeals or any of the suggestions that we have made from time to time . We think that we have made very clear , through our emissaries and through governments who are talking to both parties , our desire to sit at the table and discuss any subject that the other side desires to discuss . But we have received no response whatever that would indicate the willingness on the part of the other side to do this . I would not want to go further on that , John , than I have gone . I think the people of this country and the peaceful people of the world would find this action very revolting and repulsive , and would react accordingly . Well , the answer to your first question is no . The Omaha and Des Moines speeches did not change the consistent policy of this country that we have followed ever since I became President . Second , I think that the important thing for all of us to remember is that we are ready and willing now , and have been , without any limitation whatever , to discuss any subject with the enemy at any time that he is willing to discuss it . But , Ed , until he gives some indication that he will sit down and talk , I see nothing to be gained from these exploratory excursions . I am very concerned about the conditions that exist in many of the large cities of this country during this summer . I have talked to the Governors on that subject this morning , and I have been in touch with a number of the mayors in most recent days . As I said in the previous press conference , I am not interested in black power or white power . What I am concerned with is democratic power , with a small d . I believe that if we are not to lose a great many of the gains that we have made in recent years in treating people equally in this country , giving them equality in opportunity , equality in education , and equality in employment , then we must recognize that while there is a Negro minority of 10 percent in this country , there is a majority of 90 percent who are not Negroes . But I believe most of those 90 percent have come around to the viewpoint of wanting to see equality and justice given their fellow citizens . Now they want to see it done under the law and they want to see it done orderly . They want to see it done without violence . I hope that the lawfully constituted authorities of this country , as well as every citizen of this country , will obey the law , will not resort to violence , will do everything they can to cooperate with constituted authority to see that the evil conditions are remedied , that equality is given , and that progress is made . And I shah do everything within my power to see that that is done . Sid Davis , Westinghouse Broadcasting President , does the administration have any information that the current wave of riots are the work of professional agitators who want to foment trouble in our major cities Wherever there is trouble , there are always individuals to whom suspicion is attached . But I would not want to say that the protests and the demonstrations are inspired by foreign foes . I do say that on occasions where you find this trouble , you also find people who do not approve of our system , and who in some instances contribute to the violence that occurs . It is the same as it was in my speech . I spelled it out in somewhat substantial detail in that speech . I feel that we should do everything we can to increase our exchanges , to understand other people better , to have our scientists and our businessmen , our authors and our newspaper people exchange visits and exchange viewpoints . I would hope that as a result of tearing down these harriers that some day all people in this world would be willing to be guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , that all peoples would want to cease aggression and would try to live in peace and understanding with their neighbors . So far as I am concerned , every day I am looking for new ways to understand the viewpoint of others . And I hope that at a not too distant date mainland China will be willing to open some of the barriers to these exchanges and be willing to perhaps come nearer to abiding by the principles laid down in the United Nations Charter . I have not examined that statement carefully . I heard it reported and I read a ticker item on it . I look with favor upon the general suggestion made . There is nothing that we would welcome more than for Hanoi to be willing to stop its infiltration and stop trying to gobble up its neighbor to permit those people to engage in self determination and select their own government . We generally approve of the sentiment expressed in the Saigon statement as I interpreted it . I do not attach any particular significance to the defeat of a Member of the House or the Senate . In this instance , I think it is a question of the people of the State being rather evenly divided in connection with the Senate race , and that frequently happens under our democratic system . I know of no unusual significance that I would attach to it . I think each year you will see some of the candidates win and some lose . I think until we can have more understanding of what China s plans are and China s hopes are , and what China expects to do in her own way in the future , we would not want to determine our complete course of conduct . I think we have tried to lead the way by asking them to accept as visitors some of our people , some of our businessmen , and to discuss these problems with them . We fervently hope , as I have said again and again and again , that all nations in the world will give up their thoughts of aggression and force , and will be willing to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter . Now until we see some evidence of the willingness of the various countries that may be involved to do that , I would not want to pass judgment on what our action might be . We are hoping , we are working to the end that all nations embrace those principles . We have had administration people working on possible proposals to submit to the Congress that could be used in cases of emergencies that vitally affect the public interest . I must frankly say to you that up to this point we have been unsuccessful in getting legislation that the Secretary of Labor and the other members of my Cabinet felt acceptable , and that we felt would have any chance of passage in the Congress . We are still searching for an answer . And we would like to find a solution that could be embraced by the administration , management , labor , and the Congress . But up to this point we have been quite unsuccess . No , we have made suggestions to the Congress before they recessed . The Secretary of the Treasury met with the appropriate committees and recommended that they take certain action in connection with deposits of 10 , 000 or under , or 100 , 000 or under , by placing a maximum ceiling rate on the interest paid on those deposits . The administration thought that would be helpful . The Congress did not desire to act at that time . They passed a resolution calling upon the Federal Reserve Board to take action in the matter . The Secretary of the Treasury went back to a committee of the Congress , and is working with them now . I discussed that subject last night . He hopes that we can obtain action through the Banking and Currency Committee of the House on legislation that will be helpful . We are seriously concerned with the plight of the homebuilder . We are distressed at the increased costs that are involved in the high interest rates . We had deep concerns last December when the increase was made by the Federal Reserve before the budget was submitted and without coordinating with the other fiscal agencies of the Government . But in the light of the situation as we see it now , the best thing that can be done is for Congress to act upon the legislation we have recommended We expect them to do that . And we will do everything we can to expedite it . Well , Bob , I am inclined to agree with some of those people who think that I am not a very good politician some of the time . I am going to try to do my job as best I can . I do recognize this is election year . I will be called upon to visit various parts of the country . I expect to do so . I do not think that the people of California need any advice from me to know that Governor Brown has been a great Governor . I expect to repeat that statement if given the opportunity between now and November , not only in California , but other places . I think a part of the President s job is to go out into the country , to meet the people , to talk to them , to exchange viewpoints with them . I plan to take Saturday off this weekend and to go into Kentucky , Tennessee , Illinois , and Indiana , and I will spend the weekend visiting with the people of those States . I do not expect to do that every week , but as my duties here in the White House permit , I will take advantage of every opportunity to go out into the country and discuss our program , our convictions tell them what we stand for , and ask for their support . We do not have a date or a place . The leaders of the countries in the hemisphere are now very carefully considering the subjects for that conference . The staff work is being done on the subjects and the problems that the conference would deal with . I am unable to , and I think the leaders of the hemisphere at this time are unable , to designate a time or place . I discussed with the President elect of Bolivia today this conference , and we look forward with a great deal of interest , other countries being willing , to carrying out the suggestions originally made by a Latin American leader . But the time has not been set . We think it would be very fruitful and we would be glad to attend it , and we will , assuming time is given for proper preparation by the staff people . John , I have tried to give my viewpoint and the viewpoint of this Government on the men who have been captured . I would hope that they would receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1949 . I believe that any other treatment accorded them would not be accepted by the civilized world . And I do not want to make any predictions or speculations about what will happen . I have expressed my viewpoint on what should happen . I guess I would need a little more information before I got into a complete answer to your question . The information I have indicated that in order to serve all the press , certain rules were laid down , and that the press , for their convenience , was asked to follow those rules so no one would have an advantage . Because either some did not accept the rules or some did not follow them , some differences emerged . But if I could have your permission to just step aside on any of the detailed wedding arrangements , I would like very much to do so . Yes , more manpower will be required . We are working day and night on all four fronts . The economic front and the report this evening from Ambassador Lodge indicates that there has been some improvement in prices and the economic situation there . The diplomatic front our representatives and the representatives of other nations are now exploring in other capitals , in many other places , the possibilities of trying to find a way to get to the peace table . On the political front , plans are going forward for the election of the Constituent Assembly early in September , and numbers and numbers of candidates are filing for the places . We are supplying such advice and counsel as we can in the hope that this will be an orderly democratic election where the majority of the people can freely express themselves , and select the leaders of their choice . On the military front , our troops under General Westmoreland 14 are giving an excellent account of themselves . They are attempting to anticipate the enemy and doing everything they can to deter him from further aggression , from additional infiltration , and from the terror that he practices . The results have been that the enemy has lost about 10 men for every loss the Americans have suffered . I believe the record for the last 10 weeks shows that the enemy has lost in excess of 1 , 000 men each week . Our average has been something like 100 . This week I believe it is less than 100 , and I believe theirs is more than 1 , 200 . The mail that I get , some 50 or 60 letters from the battlefront each week , shows the morale is high , that the men are well trained , that they are well and adequately supplied , and properly led . We ceased speculating a long time ago on how long this situation would endure . But I have said to you and to the American people time and again , and I repeat it today , that we shall persist . We shall send General Westmoreland such men as he may require and request , and they will be amply supplied . I have no doubt but what they will give a good account of themselves . Overall , I would say that the reports from the captured prisoners and there have been about twice as many defectors so far this year as there were the same period last year , some 10 , 000 compared to 4 , 000 but the interviews from a sample of 150 this week indicate that about 15 to 20 percent of the men that have been captured show that they are boys from 12 to 16 years of age . They show that a good many of their people take 3 months in the infiltration , walking down from North Vietnam , that a good many of them are suffering from malaria , and beriberi , and other diseases . The men who conducted the bombings on the military targets , the oil supplies of Hanoi and Haiphong , did a very careful but very perfect job . They hit about 90 percent of the total capacity of that storage , and almost 70 percent of it was destroyed . Our reports indicate that there were few civilian lives lost , if any . One estimate was that one civilian was killed , and he was the one that was at the alarm center . We were very careful not to get out of the target area , in order not to affect civilian populations . But we are going , with our allies , to continue to do everything that we can to deter the aggressor and to go to the peace table at the earliest possible date .<speech_sep>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen . I would like to announce the successful development of a major new strategic manned aircraft system , which will be employed by the Strategic Air Command . This system employs the new SR 71 aircraft , and provides a long range , advanced strategic reconnaissance plane for military use , capable of worldwide reconnaissance for military operations . The Joint Chiefs of Staff , when reviewing the RS 70 , emphasized the importance of the strategic reconnaissance mission . The SR 71 aircraft reconnaissance system is the most advanced in the world . The aircraft will fly at more than three times the speed of sound . It will operate at altitudes in excess of 80 , 000 feet . It will use the most advanced observation equipment of all kinds in the world . The aircraft will provide the strategic forces of the United States with an outstanding long range reconnaissance capability . The system will be used during periods of military hostilities and in other situations in which the United States military forces may be confronting foreign military forces . The SR 7I uses the same J 58 engine as the experimental interceptor previously announced , but it is substantially heavier and it has a longer range . The considerably heavier gross weight permits it to accommodate the multiple reconnaissance sensors needed by the Strategic Air Command to accomplish their strategic reconnaissance mission in a military environment . This billion dollar program was initiated in February of 1963 . The first operational aircraft will begin flight testing in early 1965 . Deployment of production units to the Strategic Air Command will begin shortly thereafter . Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept fully informed on the nature of and the progress in this aircraft program . Further information on this major advanced aircraft system will be released from time to time at the appropriate military secret classification levels . I am pleased to announce today that in the year ending July 30th American exports of farm products broke all records , reaching an all time high of 6 billion 151 million . This represents a 20 percent increase in farm exports in a single year a 1 billion and a 35 percent gain over the level for the year 1960 . Once again American agriculture has demonstrated its ability to succeed in highly competitive world markets . The trade surplus in agriculture last year was over 2 billion , the highest in 50 years . This represents a substantial contribution to the plus side of our balance of payments ledger . Farm exports contribute to the increased prosperity of our farm economy . The latest revised estimates from the Department of Agriculture show that net farm income in 1963 was 12 billion 518 million , more than a quarter of a billion dollars higher than we had estimated 6 months ago . The net income per farm increased from 2 , 961 in 1960 to 3 , 504 in 1963 , an increase in this period , from 1960 to 1963 , of more than 18 percent . I think I should comment briefly on a number of international problems . First , I think most Europeans know that the United States has never had any interest whatever in trying to dominate Europe or any other area of the world . On the contrary , the United States has constantly supported the strengthening of the free nations of Europe . We believe that Europe and the United States have great common interests , common purposes , and common obligations . So we have never supposed that any European country would need to choose between its ties to the United States and its ties to Europe . We believe that any effort to force such a choice would be bad for Europe , bad for the alliance . And I have found , I might say , general agreement on this view in my talks with Prime Minister Home , Chancellor Erhard , President Segni , and many other European leaders who have been here this year . Second , I should like to call your attention to the excellent series of meetings which we have had in Washington this last week with the leaders of Australia , New Zealand , and Malaysia . These meetings have allowed the United States to underscore its support for the freedom and independence of three most important Pacific states and our friendship and understanding with these governments , I feel , has been greatly strengthened . Third , in the continuing discussion of Southeast Asia , let me state American policy once more . We are determined to support the freedom and the independence of South Viet Nam , where Prime Minister Khanh and Ambassador Taylor have established the closest understanding with each other . They are in continual consultation and the policies of the two nations are the same namely , to increase the effectiveness of the whole program in that country political , social , economic , and military . It is true that there is danger and provocation from the North , and such provocation could force a response , but it is also true that the United States seeks no wider war . Other friends suggest that this problem must be moved to a conference table and , indeed , if others would keep the solemn agreements already signed at a conference table , there would be no problem in South Viet Nam . If those who practice terror and ambush and murder will simply honor their existing agreements , there can easily be peace in Southeast Asia immediately . But we do not believe in a conference called to ratify terror , so our policy is unchanged . For 10 years , and in three different administrations , the United States has been committed to the freedom and the independence of South Viet Nam , helping others to help themselves . In those 10 years , we have taken whatever actions were necessary , sending men and supplies for different specific purposes at different times . We shall stick to that policy and we shall continue our effort to make it even more effective . We shall do the same in our support for the legitimate Government of Laos . Fourth , this week I have conferred with the foreign ministers of this hemisphere at the White House and our eyes turned to Latin America . Down in Mexico there has been a highly successful meeting of the Inter American Committee on the Alliance for Progress . The foreign ministers are working here to meet a challenge to our peace and freedom . That meeting is still in session , so I must announce to you that I shall confine myself to the hope that in the spirit of the hemisphere , a sound and , I believe , an effective answer will be found . These four problems are not the only ones that we have to deal with in the world today . There are many , many others , such as dangers in Cyprus , and disturbances in the Congo , and difficulty in the Kennedy Round . But we still work for peace in Cyprus and in the Congo and for progress in the Kennedy Round . We are a steadfast people in the United States , and in the larger sense the world is less dangerous , and we are stronger than we were 4 years ago , so our work for peace must go on and will go on with success , I believe . I understand that we have with us today a group of journalists from Latin America who are here to cover the meeting of the foreign ministers . I want to extend to them a very cordial welcome . Now I am ready to answer any questions you may have . I receive detailed reports at the close of each day with regard to the investigations that have been carried on by the Federal Bureau of investigation . I do not care to comment in detail on those reports until some conclusions have been reached and some recommendations made , and until I think it is more appropriate to do so . I would not hesitate to say that the impression I gain from reading those reports is that there are extremist elements involved , and at the appropriate time I think that their identity will be made known . Senator Goldwater , through the facilities of his office , asked the legislative representative of the White House for an opportunity to meet with the President , and on an unpublicized basis . We informed the White House representative that we would be glad to meet with Senator Goldwater . We have met with Senators every day , and we would certainly be glad to meet with him any time that he thought a meeting would be useful . The 5 30 arrangement today was made . I cannot anticipate all the subjects that will come up , but I am very glad to talk to him and will try to be responsive and make the meeting as fruitful as possible . I think I have already done that . I pointed out that we had already had one conference , and that we would carry out the agreements reached at that conference table , that there would be no need of our presence there , but until there is demonstrated upon the part of those who are ignoring the agreements reached at the conference table , some desire to carry out their agreement , we expect to continue our efforts in Viet Nam . Well , I think there should be complete understanding and confidence in this country and among all our friends abroad . The control of nuclear weapons is one of the most solemn responsibilities of the President of the United States the man who is President can never get away from that responsibility and can never forget it . The American people rely on his good judgment . They want that authority vested in a civilian . They do not expect to abandon this duty to military men in the field , and I do not think they have ever seriously considered that since the Founding Fathers drafted our Constitution . myself , give close and continual attention to maintaining the most effective possible command and control over these awesome weapons . I believe that the final responsibility for all decisions on nuclear weapons must rest with the civilian head of this Government the President of the United States and I think and reiterate that I believe that is the way the American people want it . We are going to be as cooperative and as helpful as we can in an attempt to see that the people of that area have as good a government as is possible , and we have every intention of being understanding and cooperative . Well , I would say to the architect of this meeting this afternoon that I do not believe that any issue which is before the people can be eliminated from the campaign in a free society in an election year . After all , that is the purpose of elections , is to discuss the issues . If candidates differ on important questions , it is up to the electors who must choose between them and in order to be able to satisfactorily choose between them , they must hear their views . Now , I believe that all men and women are entitled to their full constitutional rights , regardless of their ancestry or their religion or the region of the country in which they may live . I believe that disputes , no matter how bitter , should be settled in the courts and not in the streets . I made that statement many times in press conferences and speeches over the country in the last several years . That is the reason that after more than two thirds of the Democrats in the Congress approved the civil rights bill , and some 80 percent of the Republicans in the Senate supported the civil rights bill , I signed the civil rights bill . I believe that all men and women are entitled to equal opportunity so that they can be judged according to their merits and not according to some artificial barrier . Now , to the extent that Senator Goldwater differs from these views , or the Republican Party differs , there will , of course , be discussion . I intend to carry on some of it , if I am a candidate . The test of a free society is that it discusses and resolves these issues intelligently . It does not sweep them under the rug when they become difficult . I propose to discuss and debate the hard and difficult issues in the spirit of attempting to resolve them , and on the assumption that the American people are willing to listen and are intelligent and are unafraid . No word or deed of mine , that I am aware of , has ever or I hope will ever lend any aid or any comfort to this small minority who would take the law into their own hands for whatever cause or whatever excuse they may use . If Senator Goldwater and his advisers , and his followers , will follow the same course that I intend to follow , and that I expect the Democratic Party to follow , which is a course of rebuffing and rebuking bigots and those who seek to excite and exploit tensions , then it will be most welcome and I think it will be a very fine contribution to our political life in America . Can you speak a little louder No , we have no plans along that line . Over the past several years I have heard rumors to that effect , and have seen news stories making predictions along that line , but we have no plans at the present time for any such action . Most campaigns are rough campaigns . I am an old campaigner . I have been at it 30 years . One of the first things I learned , at least so far as I am concerned , is the people are not much interested in my personal opinion of my opponent . Well , you have asked two questions there . First , there is no such suggestion at all . I am not unhappy . I hope I do not look unhappy . I do not feel unhappy . I do not know who suggested that to you . But the question was raised that it was unpublicized , and knowing the initiative and ingenuity of the American press , I did not think it would be unpublicized very long . I just suggested that it was rather difficult for a fellow to take a glass of water at the White House , or even go out to the hydrant and get a drink , without it being adequately publicized . I cannot even visit with my dogs without a lot of publicity . So I am not unhappy about it at all . I just explained that I thought it would be better to put it on the record , and so far as I know , Senator Goldwater is perfectly happy with it . There is no breach of faith on his part and certainly none on my part . I realize that someone might indicate , because the suggestion in all its entirety was not carried out , there might be some difficulty between us , but my object in life has always been to not provoke fights , but to prevent them , if possible . I think that their viewpoint is the same as the viewpoint of their Government . I think , generally speaking , that viewpoint is being considered by the foreign ministers who are meeting here now . I believe that they all recognize the challenge to peace and freedom which exists , and the necessity for not only being aware of that challenge but attempting to combat it with every reasonable and wise means available . I believe out of this meeting the hemisphere will find a sound and effective answer , and I think that there are some indications now that the policies that we have pursued heretofore and the ones that we are suggesting be followed now are being effective . Well , I am against sin , and I am against lawlessness , and I am very much opposed to violence . I think we have to put a stop to it . To the extent that we have the power to do so , in the Federal Government , we are doing so . We are exerting every action we know to keep violence to a minimum . We do not have a national police force in this country , we have not assumed power that we do not have , and we do not intend to . But wherever there is violence , we respond to it within the limits of our power and our authority . We do have confidence in the local authorities . We do respect the sovereign States and the executives of those States . We have communicated with the mayors and the Governors and have made available to them all the facilities of the Federal Government to cooperate with them and work effectively with them . We will continue to do so . We deplore men taking the law into their own hands and men disregarding the law , wherever it takes place . We treat them all alike . I do not think there is any doubt in anyone s mind in the United States that the President of the United States , the power of the Presidency and the people of the United States are going to do everything within their power and within their authority to stop violence wherever it appears . But our judgement is that it is not up to us to take over the authority of all the local governments and not up to us to take over the authority of all the State governments . I seem to have read and heard that other people , too , are opposed to the Federal Government usurping the rights of the States . The answer is no . I stated that earlier , but I repeat it . I think what I think about Senator Goldwater and my prediction as to the outcome of the race is not very important . I think that is a matter for the American people to decide . I think what the people want to know is how I stand on issues , and what my policies will be , and what my party stands for . They are much more interested in what the Democratic nominee advocates than what he thinks about his opponent or his chances of winning . I have every confidence that the Democratic Party will adopt a good platform , will select good candidates , and that they will present their views to the people without regard to personalities , and the people , in their wisdom , will make a good decision . Yes . Yes , I am not concerned with Senator Goldwater s opinion of me . Of course , I would like for it to be a good opinion , but if it is not , that is a matter for him . He is entitled to his view and he has the right to express it , if he thinks it is a proper thing to do and a wise thing to do . The American people will make their judgments of the various statements that he may make from time to time . I am perfectly willing to leave his opinion of me to the judgment of the people of this country . I have been rather busily engaged the last few days and I have not spent a great deal of time evaluating that situation . I do not know how much support Governor Wallace had . I do not know how it would affect the platforms and the nominees of the two parties . All I know is that he decided to withdraw . I had heard and anticipated that he would do that . He confirmed it . But what effect it will have in November , I do not know . Whatever I think is wise and necessary , and I expect to appear in various parts of the country and be very concerned with seeing that my party and my platform and the views of my candidates are properly presented . I will make whatever contribution I can , consistent with discharging my other duties , and try to be as helpful to the ticket as possible at all times . No , I said that we get reports from there every evening . I do not think there is any question but what there are some extremist elements involved in the violence that takes place there . I think that must be evident to everyone who reads the newspapers . So far as we are concerned , we are prepared to take whatever action may be necessary and desirable . We have Hoover keeping very close watch on it . He has an adequate supply of manpower available to him . He has them assigned on specific investigations at the moment , and we will follow it very closely and do whatever needs to be done . Well , we will cross that bridge when we get to it . I think foreign policy is an appropriate subject for discussion . I think the people of this country really need no advice from anyone else in other parts of the world about the decision they should make , but I think they will certainly want to be sure that the foreign policy of their country is a proper one , and I am prepared to present the views of my party on that subject and will do so at such time and at such length as may be desirable . I will leave that up to the judgment of the people and you . I do not want to be passing personal judgment on the acts of another individual . I have given you my viewpoint on it . That is a little mission you will have to do for yourself . I think that the American people are perfectly capable of making their own decision with regard to the parties and the candidates , and I think that they will do that without the necessity of advice from anyone abroad . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . I am glad to see that you are willing to trade your new comfort in the West Lobby for these straight backed chairs in the East Room . Today I have somewhat of a conflict of emotions . I wanted to give you due and adequate 3 day notice of a press conference , and at the same time I did not want to manage the news by holding up the announcement of some appointees I have here today , so we have tried to reconcile the two , and a little later in the statement I want to present to you some men that over the weekend I selected to occupy some important posts in Government . We are engaged in a crucial struggle in Viet Nam . Some may consider it a small war , but to the men who give their lives it is the last war and the stakes are high . Independent South Viet Nam has been attacked by North Viet Nam . The object of that attack is total conquest . Defeat in South Viet Nam would deliver a friendly nation to terror and repression . It would encourage and spur on those who seek to conquer all free nations that are within their reach . Our own welfare , our own freedom , would be in great danger . This is the clearest lesson of our time . From Munich until today we have learned that to yield to aggression brings only greater threats and brings even more destructive war . To stand firm is the only guarantee of a lasting peace . At every step of the way , we have used our great power with the utmost restraint . We have made every effort possible to find a peaceful solution . We have done this in the face of the most outrageous and brutal provocation against Vietnamese and against Americans alike . Through the first 7 months of 1964 , both Vietnamese and Americans were the targets of constant attacks of terror . Bombs exploded in helpless villages , in downtown movie theaters , even at the sports fields where the children played . Soldiers and civilians , men and women , were murdered and crippled , yet we took no action against the source of this brutality North Viet Nam . When our destroyers were attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin , as you will remember last summer , we replied promptly with a single raid . The punishment then was limited to the deed . For the next 6 months we took no action against North Viet Nam . We warned of danger we hoped for caution in others . Their answer was attack , and explosions , and indiscriminate murder . So it soon became clear that our restraint was viewed as weakness our desire to limit conflict was viewed as a prelude to our surrender . We could no longer stand by while attacks mounted and while the bases of the attackers were immune from reply . Therefore , we began to strike back . But America has not changed her essential position , and that purpose is peaceful settlement . That purpose is to resist aggression . That purpose is to avoid a wider war . I say again that I will talk to any government , anywhere , any time , without any conditions , and if any doubt our sincerity , let them test us . Each time we have met with silence , or slander , or the sound of guns . But just as we will not flag in battle , we will not weary in the search for peace . So I reaffirm my offer of unconditional discussions . We will discuss any subject and any point of view with any government concerned . This offer may be rejected , as it has been in the past , but it will remain open , waiting for the day when it becomes clear to all that armed attack will not yield domination over others . And I will continue along the course that we have set firmness with moderation readiness for peace with refusal to retreat . For this is the same battle which we fought for a generation . Wherever we have stood firm , aggression has been halted , peace has been restored , and liberty has been maintained . This was true under President Truman , under President Eisenhower , under President Kennedy , and it will be true again in southeast Asia . I want to go now to another subject . I want to congratulate the negotiators for the steel companies and the United Steelworkers union on the statesmanlike agreement that they reached yesterday to extend their contract . I hope and I expect that it will be approved by the union s committee tomorrow . While the settlement reached in steel is only an interim one , I think we can be confident that the final settlement will be a responsible one which fully considers not only the interest of the immediate parties , but also the larger public interest . So far in 1965 our record of wage price stability remains intact . A survey of the wage increases on more than 600 collective bargainings settled so far this year shows that on the average the percentage increases were unchanged from the moderate increases agreed on in the same period last year . A number of important settlements were at approximately the level of our guideposts , and this record of private actions is most encouraging . Today I can report to you and to the Nation that our expanding economy will produce higher Federal revenues this year than we estimated to Congress in January . I can also report that our continuing drive to hold down Government spending will produce lower expenditures this year than we estimated to Congress in January . As a result , we expect the actual budget deficit for fiscal 1965 to be at least 1 billion below the 6 , 300 million estimated last January when we sent our budget to Congress . Our expenditures , therefore , will be decreased by approximately 500 million under our estimate , and the revenues collected will be increased by approximately 500 million over our estimates . I am pleased also to announce today that the war on poverty is setting up 10 new Job Corps conservation camps in nine States . They will bring to 87 the number of centers that provide skills and education to our youngsters who are out of school and out of work . These new centers will be located in the States of Arizona , Maine , Minnesota , Montana , New Mexico , North Dakota , Ohio , Utah , and Washington . Today I would like to introduce to you some gentlemen that I intend to nominate for new assignments in this administration . First , Alan Boyd . He is 42 years of age , Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board , a distinguished lawyer , and a very competent public servant . Boyd will become Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation , the Senate being willing . Warren Wiggins . Wiggins is 42 years old , with a master s degree in public administration from Harvard . In 1962 he was chosen one of the 10 outstanding men in the Federal Government . He has been with the Peace Corps since 1961 . Today I am nominating him as Deputy Director of the Peace Corps . John Schnittker . He is 41 years old , with a Ph . from Iowa State University . He is one of the Nation s outstanding farm authorities . He has been Director of Agricultural Economics with the Department of Agriculture . Today I am nominating him to become Under Secretary of Agriculture . Charles Murphy . This judicious and able man has served in Government for 21 years under four Presidents . He was President Truman s Special Counsel in the White House . He has performed with out standing quality as Under Secretary of Agriculture . Today I am nominating him to become Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board . Gen . William McKee . He is a 4 star general who was Vice Chief of the Air Force and on retirement became special assistant to the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . Secretary McNamara has called him one of the most knowledgeable and competent administrators in the Defense Department , with skills in research and development , administration , procurement , and logistics . Today I am nominating him to be the new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency . Wilbur Cohen . Cohen is a dedicated career public servant who has served the Government for 26 years as a full time civil servant and another 5 years as a consultant . Since 1961 he has been an Assistant Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare . Today I am nominating him for a promotion to become Under Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare . Donald Turner . Turner is 44 years old , a Phi Beta Kappa from Northwestern University . He has a Ph . in economics from Harvard , and a law degree from Yale . He has been a law clerk to a Supreme Court Justice and is widely and favorably known throughout the Nation for his work and his writing in the antitrust legal field . He is currently a visiting law professor at Stanford University in California . Today I am nominating him to become Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division . Leonard Meeker . He is a career attorney with 25 years of Government service . He is a Phi Beta Kappa from Amherst College . Since 1961 he has served as Deputy Legal Adviser in the State Department . Today I am nominating him to become Legal Adviser in the State Department . We are all very much concerned about the serious situation which has developed in the last few hours in the Dominican Republic . Fighting has occurred among different elements of the Dominican armed forces and other groups . Public order in the capital at Santo Domingo has broken down . Due to the gravity of the situation , and the possible danger to the lives of American citizens in the Dominican Republic , I ordered the evacuation of those who wish to leave . As you know , the evacuation is now proceeding . My latest information is that 1 , 000 Americans have already been taken aboard ships of the Navy off the port of Haina , 8 miles west of Santo Domingo . We profoundly deplore the violence and disorder in the Dominican Republic . The situation is grave , and we are following the developments very closely . It is our hope that order can promptly be restored , and that a peaceful settlement of the internal problems can be found . I have just received the sad news of the passing of Edward Murrow . It came to me just a little while ago . I believe that all of us feel a deep sense of loss . We who knew him knew that he was a gallant fighter , a man who dedicated his life both as a newsman and as a public official to an unrelenting search for truth . He subscribed to the proposition that free men and free inquiry are inseparable . He built his life on that unbreakable truth . We have all lost a friend . I will be glad to take any questions now . I do not believe in characterizing people with labels . I think you do a great disservice when you engage in name calling . We want honest , forthright discussion in this country , and that will be discussion with differences of views , and we welcome what our friends have to say , whether they agree with us or not . I would not want to label people who agree with me or disagree with me . We deplore fighting wherever it takes place . We have been in dose touch with the situation there . We are very hopeful that ways and means can be found to avoid conflict between these two friends of our country . I talked to Secretary Rusk about it within the hour , and we are anxious to do anything and everything that we can do to see that peace is restored in that area and conflict is ended . I have not studied the proposal and was not familiar with the fact that it had been made . I think it was very evident from the Baltimore speech that most of the non Communist countries in the world welcomed the proposal in that speech , and most of the Communist countries found objections with it . I am very hopeful that some ways and means can be found to bring the parties who are interested in southeast Asia to a conference table . Just what those ways and means will be , I do not know . But every day we explore to the limit of our capacity every possible political and diplomatic move that would bring that about . We have read their statements from time to time , and the statements of other powers about what they propose 2 Item 172 . to do . We are in close touch with the situation . That is all I think I would like to say on that matter . Yes . I think there has been unjust criticism and unfair criticism and uninformed criticism of the poverty program even before Congress passed it . Some people opposed it every step of the way . Some people oppose it now . I do not know of any national program in peacetime that has reached so many people so fast and so effectively . Over 16 , 000 Americans have already volunteered to live and work with the Peace Corps domestically . A quarter of a million young men have joined the Job Corps . Every major city has developed poverty plans and made application for funds . Three hundred State , city , and county community action programs have already received their money . Forty five thousand students from needy families are already enrolled in 800 colleges under the work program . More than 125 , 000 adults are trainees in adult education on the work experience program . We will have difficulties . We will have politicians attempting to get some jobs in the local level . We will have these differences as we do in all of our programs , but I have great confidence in Sargent Shriver as an administrator and as a man , and I have great confidence in the wisdom the Congress displayed in passing the poverty program . I think it will be one of the great monuments to this administration . I think that we have friends throughout the world . I am not concerned with any friends that we have lost . Following my Baltimore speech , I received from our allies almost a universal approval . Our enemies would have you believe that we are following policies that are ill advised , but we are following the same policies in Asia that we followed in Europe , that we followed in Turkey and Greece and Iran . We are resisting aggression , and as long as the aggressors attack , we will stay there and resist them whether we make friends or lose friends . I think that is being worked out in the conferences they are having today , and they will have in the next few weeks . I have always opposed the poll tax . I am opposed to it now . I have been advised by constitutional lawyers that we have a problem in repealing the poll tax by statute . For that reason , while a Member of Congress , I initiated and supported a constitutional amendment to repeal the poll tax in Federal elections . I think the bill as now drawn will not permit the poll tax to be used to discriminate against voters , and I think the administration will have adequate authority to prevent its use for that purpose . I have asked the Attorney General , however , to meet with the various Members of the House and Senate who are interested in this phase of it , and if possible , take every step that he can within constitutional bounds to see that the poll tax is not used as a discrimination against any voter anywhere . I said in my opening statement that we went for months without destroying a bridge , or an ammunition depot , or a radar station . Those military targets have been the primary targets that we have attacked . There is no blood in a bridge made of concrete and steel , but we do try to take it out so that people cannot furnish additional troops and additional equipment to kill the people of South Viet Nam , and to kill our own soldiers . There are not many civilians involved in a radar station , but we do try to make it ineffective so that they cannot plot our planes and shoot our boys out of the skies . There are not many individuals involved in an ammunition dump , but we have tried to destroy that ammunition so that it would be exploded in North Viet Nam and not in the bodies of the people of South Viet Nam or our American soldiers . We have said time and time again that we regret the necessity of doing this , but as long as aggression continues , as long as they bomb in South Viet Nam , as long as they bomb our sports arenas , and our theaters , and our embassies , and kill our women and our children and the Vietnamese soldiers , several thousand of whom have been killed since the first of the year , we think that we are justified in trying to slow down that operation and make them realize that it is very costly , and that their aggression should cease . I do sometimes wonder how some people can be so concerned with our bombing a cold bridge of steel and concrete in North Viet Nam , but never open their mouths about a bomb being placed in our embassy in South Viet Nam . The moment that this aggression ceases , the destruction of their bridges and their radar stations and the ammunition that they use on our bodies will cease . First of all , I would not assume many parts of your statement . First , we did not cancel it . So that is the first error that the critics have made . We feel very friendly toward the people of India and the Government of India toward the people of Pakistan and the Government of Pakistan . I have spent some time in both of those countries . I have had the leaders of those countries visit me in this country and visit in my home . I have before the Congress now recommendations concerning the peoples of those countries and how we can work together to try to achieve peace in the world . I said through the appropriate channels to those governments that I had had some eight or nine visitors already the first 90 days of this administration that the Congress was hopeful that it would get out of here in early summer that we had approximately 75 top important measures that we were trying to get considered and passed , one of which vitally affected that part of the world and that I could be much more communicative and could respond much more to their suggestions and to their recommendations on the future of India and their 5 year plan , and Pakistan and their plan , if our visit could follow the enactment of some of these bills instead of preceding them , because if it preceded them , I could not speak with authority . I would not know what the Congress would do . We have spent in excess of 10 billion in that area , and this year we will propose expenditures of more than 1 billion . But if the Congress said no to me and did not pass the foreign aid bill or materially reduced it , I would have made a commitment that I could not support , so I said , If you would like to come now in the month of May or June , during this period , we can have a visit , but we will not be able to be as responsive as I would like to be if you could come a little later in the year . I have been host a few times in my life and when you put things that way , most people want to come at the time that would be most convenient to us , to the host , and would be most helpful to them . We communicated that to the appropriate people , and the answer came back that they would accept that decision . I think it was a good decision in our interest and I think it was a good decision in their interest . I am very sorry that our people have made a good deal of it , but the provocation of the differences sometimes comes about , and I regret it . So far as I know , it is a good decision , and a wise one , and one that I would make again tomorrow . Well , first of all , I have the responsibility for decision on nuclear weapons . That rests with the President . It is the most serious responsibility that rests with him . Secretary McNamara very carefully and very clearly in his television appearance yesterday covered that subject thoroughly , and I think adequately . There is not anything that I could really add to what he said . I would observe this that I have been President for 17 months , and I have sat many hours and weeks with the officials of this Government in trying to plan for the protection and security of our people . I have never had a suggestion from a single official of this Government or employee of this Government concerning the use of such weapons in this area . The only person that has ever mentioned it to me has been a newspaperman writing a story , and each time I tell them , Please get it out of your system . Please forget it . There is just not anything to it . No one has discussed it with us at all . I think that when Secretary McNamara told you of the requirement yesterday and that no useful purpose was served by going into it further , I thought it had ended there . I would not know . I frequently see statements they make that we never heard of . I do not know about the particular report that you mentioned . Our purpose in Viet Nam is , as you well know , to advise and to assist those people in resisting aggression . We are performing that duty there now . I would not be able to anticipate or to speculate on the conduct of each individual in the days ahead . I think that if the enemy there believes that we are there to stay , that we are not going to tuck our tails and run home and abandon our friends , I believe in due time peace can be observed in that area . My objective is to contribute what we can to assist the people of South Viet Nam who have lost thousands of lives defending their country , and to provide the maximum amount of deterrent with the minimum cost . They have lost thousands of people since February . We have lost some 40 to 50 people of our own . We could not anticipate in February whether we would lose 50 or whether we would lose 500 . That depends on the fortunes and the problems of conflict . But I can assure you that we are being very careful that we are being very studious that we are being very deliberate that we are trying to do everything we can within reason to convince these people that they should not attack , that they should not be aggressors , that they should not try to swallow up their neighbor , and we are doing it with the minimum amount of expenditures of lives that we can spend . I do not want to pass on it . We have laid down the guideposts . They are well acquainted with them both management and employees . They have had very responsible negotiations , and we are very pleased with the outcome of those negotiations . We anticipate that they will be confirmed by both parties very shortly , and we believe between now and the September deadline that we will have an agreement . I do not think that I have ever observed a period in the life of free enterprise in this country when American labor and American business have been more responsible , and have been more anxious to work with their Government in maintaining full productivity , and I expect that that will come about . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . After discussion with Vice President Humphrey and members of the Space Council , as well as Defense Secretary McNamara , I am today instructing the Department of Defense to immediately proceed with the development of a manned orbiting laboratory . This program will bring us new knowledge about what man is able to do in space . It will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of America . It will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned and unmanned space flight . It will make it possible to perform very new and rewarding experiments with that technology and equipment . The cost of developing the manned orbiting laboratory will be 1 . 5 billion . Unmanned flights to test launchings , recovery , and other basic parts of the system , will begin late next year or early 1967 . The initial unmanned launch of a fully equipped laboratory is scheduled for 1968 . This will be followed later that year by the first of five flights with two man crews . The Air Force has selected the Douglas Aircraft Company to design and to build the spacecraft in which the crew of the laboratory will live and operate . The General Electric Company will plan and develop the space experiments . The Titan III C booster will launch the laboratory into space and a modified version of the NASA Gemini capsule will be the vehicle in which the astronauts return to earth . Even as we meet , Gemini 5 , piloted by two very gallant men , backed by hundreds of dedicated space scientists and engineers and great administrators , now orbits the earth as a dramatic reminder that our American dream for outer space is a dream of peace and a dream of friendly cooperation among all the nations of the earth . We believe the heavens belong to the people of every country . We are working and we will continue to work through the United Nations our distinguished Ambassador , Goldberg , is present with us this morning to extend the rule of law into outer space . We intend to live up to our agreement not to orbit weapons of mass destruction and we will continue to hold out to all nations , including the Soviet Union , the hand of cooperation in the exciting years of space exploration which lie ahead for all of us . Therefore , I have today , in fact directed James Webb , the administrator of our civilian space program , after conferring with the Secretary of State and our Ambassador to the United Nations and others , to invite the Soviet Academy of Science to send a very high level representative here next month to observe the launching of Gemini 6 . I hope that he will find it convenient to come . We will certainly give him a warm welcome in America . This morning I have just concluded a breakfast meeting with the Cabinet and with the heads of Federal agencies . I am asking each of them to immediately begin to introduce a very new and a very revolutionary system of planning and programing and budgeting throughout the vast Federal Government , so that through the tools of modern management the full promise of a finer life can be brought to every American at the lowest possible cost . Under this new system each Cabinet and agency head will set up a very special staff of experts who , using the most modern methods of program analysis , will define the goals of their department for the coming year . Once these goals are established , this system will permit us to find the most effective and the least costly alternative to achieving American goals . This program is designed to achieve three major objectives It will help us find new ways to do jobs faster , to do jobs better , and to do jobs less expensively . It will insure a much sounder judgment through more accurate information , pinpointing those things that we ought to do more , spotlighting those things that we ought to do less . It will make our decision making process as up to date , I think , as our space exploring program . Everything that I have done in both legislation and the construction of a budget has always been guided by my own very deep concern for the American people consistent with wise management , of course , of the taxpayer s dollar . So this new system will identify our national goals with precision and will do it on a continuing basis . It will enable us to fulfill the needs of all the American people with a minimum amount of waste . And because we will be able to make sounder decisions than ever before , I think the people of this Nation will receive greater benefits from every tax dollar that is spent in their behalf . On July the 20th , I named as United States Ambassador to the United Nations a man to whom the sacred cause of peace is an obsession Justice Arthur Goldberg . So I am happy this morning to reinforce the United States team at the United Nations with four Americans who also share a passion for peace As Ambassador Goldberg s principal Deputy , I am naming a career Ambassador with a distinguished record of more than 20 years in diplomacy Charles Yost . As Representative to the Security Council , with the rank of Ambassador , I am naming the noted president of Howard University James Nabrit , As Representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations , a famous American who is giving up his seat in Congress to become our new Ambassador James Roosevelt , the eldest son of the late beloved Franklin Delano Roosevelt . Roosevelt is with us this morning . Will you please stand , Roosevelt As Representative to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations , also with the rank of Ambassador , a vibrant , attractive American woman who has already served as the Nation s chief diplomat in both Denmark and Bulgaria Eugenie Anderson of Minnesota . Tomorrow I will sign into law one of the most important hi Is enacted by Congress this session the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 . To direct this far reaching program of promise for the distressed areas all across America , I intend to nominate as Assistant Secretary of Commerce and as Director of Economic Development one of our most brilliant young public servants , the outstanding Administrator of the Small Business Administration Eugene Foley . Please stand , Foley . I am also pleased to announce this morning the appointment of Hobart Taylor , , as a member of the Board of Directors of the Export Import Bank . Taylor has been Associate Special Counsel to the President since May 1964 . He was previously Executive Vice Chairman of the President s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and has largely directed our efforts with the large corporations and institutions of this country in our plans for progress . Will you please stand , Taylor He will be succeeded as my Associate Special Counsel by another talented young lawyer who holds degrees from both Harvard and Yale and now serves as Deputy Special Assistant to the President Clifford Alexander , Alexander has recently reached the tired old age of 32 . Will you please stand , Alexander It is also a pleasure to announce the nomination this morning of the new United States Attorney for the District of Columbia it may interest some of you people who live here in the District of Columbia David Bress . Bress has not only carried on a very vigorous private practice and civic life but he has taught in the field of law at American University , at Georgetown Law Center , the University of Virginia Law School , and has been head of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia . Will you stand , Bress Fifty years ago , President Woodrow Wilson asked , Just what is it that America stands for If she stands for one thing more than another , it is for the sovereignty of self governing people . So I am very proud of the progress that we are making toward that principle on one front and I am disappointed at the lack of progress that we are making on another . The Attorney General and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission have just reported to me what I think is a truly remarkable story In the 19 days since I signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which I recommended to Congress and they promptly enacted , already a total of 27 , 385 Negroes in 13 counties in 3 Southern States have qualified to vote . And they represent nearly one third of the potential applicants in all those 13 counties . Only this morning a team of Federal examiners will begin to list voters in the 14th county that has been designated by the Attorney General . That new office will be opened in the town of Prentiss in Jefferson Davis County , Mississippi . I am equally encouraged by the high level of acceptance and I am very pleased with the compliance that we have had in scores of other Southern counties throughout the country . A check of 45 counties in Georgia shows already that 99 percent of 2 , 000 Negro applicants have been registered without any difficulty . In 50 Louisiana counties , not a single Negro has been rejected . In Mississippi , nearly 12 , 000 Negroes have been registered by local registrars over and above those that we mentioned that were registered by Federal examiners . The number of Negro citizens registered in Mississippi has increased 100 percent in the last 6 weeks . Obedience is always preferable to enforcement . Where enforcement is necessary , we will not hesitate to meet our responsibilities under the law . But the very clear and the very heartening lesson of this wonderful report is that obedience to the law is a fact of life to so many men and women of good will throughout the South . On another front here in our lovely Nation s Capital City the sovereignty of self governing people is still unresolved . The people of the District of Columbia , I think deserve and I think must and will have home rule . It is an irony and disgrace that having extended self government already to the Philippine Islands and to Puerto Rico , having enthusiastically recommended democratic principles to nations around the world , nation after nation , after having welcomed Alaska and Hawaii as new States , that somehow some people seem to be afraid to trust almost a million American citizens with the management of their own affairs here in the District of Columbia . Congress is moving to redeem this disgrace . The Senate as on at least five different occasions in the past has acted to pass a good home rule bill containing a solid and a workable charter for home rule . That bill should come before the House of Representatives very shortly . The limits of reasonable delay have long since been reached and passed . No one doubts the outcome once that bill finally gets to the floor of the House and the Members are permitted to vote on it . But what is needed this morning is a commitment by the leadership and by the members of both parties , if you please , to the only practical means of getting the bill on the floor , and that seems to be the petition to discharge the House District Committee from further delay of the bill . Bills have been pending before that committee for year after year after year . So I have , as President , urged the Speaker of the House of Representatives , McCormack , and the other leaders and members of my own party to lead the way in this movement . But to all of those who believe in our two party elective system , to all of those who believe in taxation with representation , to those who believe in keeping faith with our own people , I express the hope that you , too , will join us in this effort . I am now ready to take any questions that you may have to ask . Yes . I think that the steel situation is on almost every citizen s mind in this country . The decisions which will be made in Pittsburgh this week are of vital importance to every person in this country and to people in other parts of the world . There must be continued cost and price stability in our American economy and I expect full and complete responsibility in the current wage negotiations and I expect continued stability in steel prices . As we meet here today , we are troubled with many questions , but we must never forget that our boys are still fighting in South Viet Nam and that our economic strength is the keystone of free world peace . It is extremely important to the security that we hold very dear . So the decisions that will be made this week by steel management and by labor in the days that are ahead must certainly take into account the overall greater national interest which is involved . The Director of the Federal Mediation Service , one of my most trusted public servants , William Simkin , is in Pittsburgh and he is there for the purpose of making every contribution he can to assist the parties in reaching a responsible agreement . The eyes of this country are on the leaders of both management and labor . We are expecting and we believe we will receive the responsibility which the national interest requires . 6 No , I think that our operations have been up to our expectations . I think a review and evaluation of them will reflect that they have been rather effective , and I think that they are in keeping with the planned purpose of their mission . Well , I do not want to get into any personalities in the matter . I think the issues of war and peace in Viet Nam are far greater than any personal differences that one might have for that matter , far greater than any party s . I have said on many occasions , and I should like to repeat to the American people , and to Hanoi also , that I am very pleased with the support the American people are giving to the policies of their Government , both at home and abroad . While our men are fighting and dying for freedom in South Viet Nam , I am going to do everything that I can to support those men and to unite the country behind them . I think that , generally speaking , the country is united behind them and I think this will be a source of strength to our boys out there . I have received excellent cooperation from the leadership of both parties in the past , and I expect to continue in the future . The boys that are fighting the war are not divided between Republicans and Democrats . The men directing the strategies involved I do not know what party they belong to . The distinguished Secretary of Defense , before coming into Government , was a member of a party different from mine . The President with whom I counsel often and who has had the greatest experience in not only political and diplomatic matters , but in matters of a military nature , President Eisenhower , has been a tower of strength to me , to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to the Secretary of Defense , and to the leaders of the Congress . So I would say that we welcome expressions of viewpoint from the leadership in both parties . There will be times when we do not see everything alike , but that may contribute strength to our system . I do not think that Hanoi should ever for a moment entertain the illusion that the people of this country are not united in the work of this Government . I do not know how good a prophet I am . I had put this legislation very high in our list . I think it is extremely important . I have continually urged the leadership to proceed with this consideration . The House has it under study now . I have talked to the Speaker at length , yesterday and again today . I am sending him a letter later today expressing very strongly the views of the executive branch of the Government again . I am hoping that that bill will pass as reported by the House Judiciary Committee without crippling amendments . It has not been acted upon yet by the Senate Judiciary Committee . I believe that it should be acted on before the Congress gets out of here . I favor the House bill . I think it will result in a great improvement not only in our relations with other nations but will be very satisfying to large segments of our own people . I believe it will pass . I would like to have the help of all of you , though , in that connection . I would think that the Federal Government has a different situation from what we have in certain segments of our private sector , but I would hope that we would never ask for privileges for ourselves in Government that we would not expect private industry to share in . Therefore , when you make allowances for the difference in public and private employment and the various policies and fringe benefits , I would hope that we could keep our civilian pay structure in line with the guidelines that we recommend for private industry . I do think the House bill goes too far . I do think that it would violate the guidelines . I do hope that the Congress will carefully and thoroughly consider the destructive effect it would have if we should pass the bill in its present form . We had a most distinguished panel of most distinguished Americans study this whole subject . They made recommendations . We would hope that the Congress would enact those recommendations with certain modifications that they thought were required , but certainly not go anywhere near the overall recommendations made by the House committee , because we think that would be very disastrous to our price wage stability policy in this country and we think it would violate the guidelines . I think that we are always hopeful that all the world is aware of our desire for discussions and our desire for negotiations and our desire for peace . I do not think it is really important how much extra you get an hour in your steel contract , or what the increase of Federal pay is , if your boy is going to be drafted tomorrow and going to be called upon to give his life in Viet Nam . So peace peace , that simple little 5 letter word is the most important word in the English language to us at this time and it occupies more of our attention than any other word or any other subject . We do expect they are listening we do hope they are listening . Secretary Rusk , Ambassador Goldberg , Secretary Ball , and all of the other trained diplomats that we have in this country are going to constantly be searching for ways and means to substitute words for guns , and to bring men from the battlefield to the conference table . Our every waking hour is going to be spent trying to find the means for doing this . I do not know of any question . I certainly do . Yes . Yes , sir . We have detailed action planned that we worked on until late in the evening last night . Moyers will have a release available for you . We did not want to take the television time and further time from your questions , but it will be available later in the week . We are appointing a top flight task force , headed by Deputy Attorney General Ramsey Clark , and they will proceed to Los Angeles at a very early date . The details of their work and their program will be announced as soon as they are available . Ambassador Bunker has done a very exceptional job there . We are very hopeful that we can obtain agreement on provisional government , and that we can set up the guidelines that will result in an election at an early date where the people of that area can have self determination and can make the selection of their own government officials . We have felt very close to a solution several times , and we never are quite sure when it will come , but we expect it shortly . I do not have the time to review all of my messages . But as I remember it , there are about four bills still in House committees that have not been reported , that are being worked upon . They include the highway improvement bill , beautification bill , and the heart , cancer , and stroke bill . Larry O Brien is a much better authority on this than I am . He will be glad to be helpful in that respect . There are some eight bills in Senate committees that still need to be reported . There are a dozen or so bills that have been reported that need to be scheduled . They are either awaiting a rule or awaiting schedule in one body or the other . There are about six bills in conference , one of which has emerged recently , much to our satisfaction the foreign aid bill . We are hopeful that all of those measures can be moved . There are relatively few to be reported . There are a good many more to be scheduled . There are only half a dozen in conference . We think that in a reasonable time , by diligent work not around the clock , but a full week in the next several weeks we can complete our program . If we could , we would like to do that , so that the Members could go home and have some rest before coming back in January . There will be some important messages for them , awaiting them , when they return in January , but we would not expect anything like the volume of substantive legislation next year . We would expect several substantive bills like a transportation policy and like some refinements in our foreign policy , that we will be submitting messages on food and health and things of that nature . But we look forward to the Congress being able to get out of here early next year I would say certainly far ahead of the end of the fiscal year in June so that the Members could be at home and could report to the people . We like for the Republicans and the Democrats all to be home and report to the people what is going on here , what is going on in the world , so they can be fully informed , and we think that it makes for a more united country . I am always hesitant to make a prophecy about how good things are or how bad they are , because you fellows have a way of remembering what a public official says way back there and feeding it up to him from time to time . But I think it must be evident to you that your Marines and your other soldiers in the Army , and the men in the Navy and the Air Force have been giving a good account of themselves . And working very closely with the dedicated and patriotic and determined South Vietnamese , always associated with them and working with them , they have been quite effective in the last few weeks . As I told you , in our last meeting , I plead with my Cabinet every time I see them . I say to Secretary McNamara , You be sure that our men have the morale , and have the equipment , and have the necessary means of seeing that we keep our commitments in Viet Nam , and we have the strength to do it . I say to Rusk , while he is working with his right hand on strength and stability there and doing the job we are committed to do , You and Goldberg and the rest of you , use that left hand and be sure that you do everything to get us away from the battlefield and back at the conference table , if that is possible . So we are like a man in a ring . We are using our right and our left constantly . I would agree that the whole situation there is very delicate , a matter that requires constant watching . Our Secretary of State is doing that . The President is doing it . We have recently sent to Indonesia one of our most trained and trusted diplomats . We are going to make every contribution that we can to try to preserve peace in that area . We think that what we are doing in South Viet Nam has a very important bearing on the whole sector of that part of the world . I would not want to make any prophecies as to what the final outcome would be , other than we will be hopeful and we will be continuing in our efforts to contribute anything we can to a peaceful solution . Well , first I reviewed that veto message very carefully late in the evening of the last day with most of my best legal advisers . The statement as I remember it said that the Attorney General informed me that it was repugnant to the Constitution . So I would refer you first to the Attorney General , and I know he would be glad to give great weight to any observations you might have . myself , agree with the Attorney General . I hope the Congress will share that view . I think that we do owe the Congress a reasonable reporting procedure . I indicated in my message that I would willingly make those reports if it could be worked out where it would not adversely affect our military posture or my duties as Commander in Chief . I genuinely believe that the bill , in the form that I vetoed it , did considerably restrain the Commander in Chief and was not in the national interest . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans On yesterday I went before the Congress to speak for the first time as President of the United States . Tonight , on this Thanksgiving , I come before you to ask your help , to ask your strength , to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor . All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget . We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been , but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be , what is to be for America , for the world , for the cause we lead , for all the hopes that live in our hearts . A great leader is dead a great Nation must move on . Yesterday is not ours to recover , but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose . I am resolved that we shall win the tomorrows before us . So I ask you to join me in that resolve , determined that from this midnight of tragedy , we shall move toward a new American greatness . More than any generation before us , we have cause to be thankful , so thankful , on this Thanksgiving Day . Our harvests are bountiful , our factories flourish , our homes are safe , our defenses are secure . We live in peace . The good will of the world pours out for us . But more than these blessings , we know tonight that our system is strong strong and secure . A deed that was meant to tear us apart has bound us together . Our system has passed you have passed a great test . You have shown what John Kennedy called upon us to show in his proclamation of this Thanksgiving that decency of purpose , that steadfastness of resolve , and that strength of will which we inherit from our forefathers . What better conveys what is best for America than this On Saturday , when these great burdens had been mine only hours , the first two citizens to call upon me and to offer their whole support were Dwight Eisenhower and Harry Truman . Since last Friday , Americans have turned to the good , to the decent values of our life . These have served us . Yes , these have saved us . The service of our public institution and our public men is the salvation of us all from the Supreme Court to the States . And how much better would it be , how much more sane it would be , how much more decent and American it would be if all Americans could spend their fortunes and could give their time and spend their energies helping our system and its servants to solve your problems instead of pouring out the venom and the hate that stalemate us in progress . I have served in Washington 32 years 32 years yesterday . I have seen five Presidents fill this awesome office . I have known them well and I have counted them all as friends President Herbert Hoover , President Franklin Roosevelt , President Harry Truman , President Dwight Eisenhower , and President John Kennedy . In each administration the greatest burden that the President had to bear had been the burden of his own countrymen s unthinking and unreasoning hate and division . So , in these days , the fate of this office is the fate of us all . I would ask all Americans on this day of prayer and reverence to think on these things . Let all who speak and all who teach and all who preach and all who publish and all who broadcast and all who read or listen let them reflect upon their responsibilities to bind our wounds , to heal our sores , to make our society well and whole for the tasks ahead of us . It is this work that I most want us to do to banish rancor from our words and malice from our hearts to close down the poison spring of hatred and intolerance and fanaticism to perfect our unity north and south , east and west to hasten the day when bias of race , religion , and region is no more and to bring the day when our great energies and decencies and spirit will be free of the burdens that we have borne too long . Our view is outward , our thrust is forward , but we remember in our hearts this brave young man who lies in honored eternal rest across the Potomac . We remember him we remember his wonderful and courageous widow that we all love . We remember Caroline and John and all the great family who gave the Nation this son and brother . And to honor his memory and the future of the works he started , I have today determined that Station No . 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range and the NASA Launch Operation Center in Florida shall hereafter be known as the John Kennedy Space Center . I have also acted today with the understanding and the support of my friend , the Governor of Florida , Farris Bryant , to change the name of Cape Canaveral . It shall be known hereafter as Cape Kennedy . On this Thanksgiving Day , as we gather in the warmth of our families , in the mutual love and respect which we have for one another , and as we bow our heads in submission to divine providence , let us also thank God for the years that He gave us inspiration through His servant , John Kennedy . Let us today renew our dedication to the ideals that are American . Let us pray for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion , whatever the color of their skins for God made all of us , not some of us , in His image . All of us , not just some of us , are His children . And , finally , to you as your President , I ask that you remember your country and remember me each day in your prayers , and I pledge to you the best within me to work for a new American greatness , a new day when peace is more secure , when justice is more universal , when freedom is more strong in every home of all mankind . Thank you and good night . My fellow Americans On yesterday I went before the Congress to speak for the first time as President of the United States .

Thank you and good night .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . I have been asked to give a statement about the consular convention that is pending before the United States Senate . I should like to say very briefly that I hope the Senate will give its advice and consent to the proposed convention with the S . I feel very strongly that the ratification of this treaty is very much in our national interest . I feel this way for two principal reasons First , we need this treaty to protect 18 , 000 American citizens who each year travel from this country to the Soviet The convention requires immediate notification to us whenever an American is arrested in the Soviet Union . It insures our right to visit that citizen within 4 and as often thereafter as is desirable . We think that we need these rights help to protect American citizens . These are rights which the Soviet citizens already have who travel in this country , because guaranteed by our Constitution . Second , the convention does not require the opening of consulates in this country or in the Soviet Union . It does provide that should any such consulate be opened , the officials would have diplomatic immunity . The Secretary of State informs me that no negotiations for consulates are underway and that the most that he can envision in the foreseeable future is the opening of one consulate in each country , to be manned by from 10 to 15 people . There are presently 452 Soviet officials in the United States who have diplomatic immunity . If an additional consulate were opened , and if another 10 were added to the 452 , Hoover has assured me that this small increment would raise no problems which the FBI cannot effectively and efficiently deal with . In short , I think we very much need this convention to protect American interests , and to protect American citizens abroad . In my judgment , it raises no problem with respect to our national security . Therefore , I hope very much that the Senate , in its wisdom , after full debate , will see fit to ratify it . I will be glad to have any questions . Cormier states a question that I know is on the minds of all the people here today and all the people in this country . As you know , I have underlined over and over again the very deep interest of the United States in a prompt and peaceful settlement of all the problems in Southeast Asia . I have said many times that we are ready to go more than halfway in achieving this result . I would remind all of you that we would welcome a conference in Southeast Asia . This might be a Geneva conference . It could be an all Asian conference , or any other generally acceptable forum . We would be glad to see the unconditional discussions to which I referred in my statement of April 1965 at Johns Hopkins . We would participate in preliminary discussions which might open the way for formal negotiations . We are prepared today to talk about mutual steps of deescalation . We would be prepared to talk about such subjects as the exchange of prisoners , the demilitarization , or the demilitarized zone , or any other aspect which might take even a small step in the direction of peace . We would be prepared to discuss any points which the other side wishes to bring up , along with points which we and our allies very much want to raise ourselves . Or there could be preliminary discussions to see whether there could be an agreed set of points which could be the basis for negotiation . So it is against this background that we study very carefully all of the public statements made which appear from time to time and which bear upon Southeast Asia , and all the views which we receive from or through other governments . It would not be helpful to me and I do not intend to do so to comment on any particular channel or communications at this point . But you may be sure that we are diligent in our search for the possibility of peaceful settlement . In all candor , I must say that I am not aware of any serious effort that the other side has made , in my judgment , to bring the fighting to a stop and to stop the war . We have made clear that if the other side desires to discuss peace at any time , we will be very happy to have appropriate arrangements made to see that that is carried out . Where we would talk , who would talk , what we would talk about are all matters that could be worked out between the two governments involved . We have made clear to them , and to the world , the principles that we believe must govern a peace meeting of this kind , and a settlement that we would hope would come out of it the honoring of the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 , the right of self determination for the people of South Vietnam , to insure that they are freed from the threat or use of force . But we have , I must say , as of today no indication that the other side is prepared in any way to settle on these limited and decent terms . We hope very much that we can have some signals in that direction , but I in candor must say that as of now we do not have . I think that any peace agreement will involve understandings on both parts and certain concessions on both parts and certain understandings . I do not think that we can determine those before we come together , or through any press conference techniques . I can only repeat what I said in the State of the Union that I wish that the conflict in Vietnam was over . And I can only repeat what I have said so many times I will do anything I can the part of this Government to go more than halfway to bring it to an end . I must say that we face great costs . We face agony . We do plan to carry out our efforts out there . We are going to support our troops in the field . We are going to work with our Vietnamese allies toward pacification and constitutional government . While we are doing that , every hour of every day the spokesmen for this Government are under instructions to explore every possibility for peace . But I do not want to disillusion any of you . And I do not want any of you to be caught by speculation . As of this moment , I cannot report that there are any serious indications that the other side is ready to stop the war . I see almost every day some speculation by some individual or some hope or desire expressed by some government . And I assume that different individuals get different impressions . Certainly they have different hopes . I can only speak for myself , John , and with the information that I have , with the knowledge that is brought to me , I must say that I do not interpret any action that I have observed as being a serious effort to either go to a conference table or to bring the war to an end . I think that there is little I can add to what the general public knows about the events in China . I think that we all know that they are having very serious problems . And I would not think that would add anything to the strength of our adversaries in that area . I think that we can see from some of the problems that we have ourselves from time to time that unity is very important in connection with our operations . And I do not see that the differences in China are going to contribute anything to the strength of the North Vietnamese . On the other hand , I do not want to hold out any hopes to you that I do not have myself . And I cannot say at this moment that the events in China are going to contribute immediately to the end of the war in Vietnam . I stated in my Baltimore speech in early 1965 what we expected to come from the bombing . We felt that it would improve the morale of the people in South Vietnam who felt that they had almost lost the war . We felt that it would make the North Vietnamese pay a much heavier price for what they were doing . And we felt that it would make the infiltration more difficult . We think it has achieved all of those expressed purposes . We cannot speak with cold assurance on the infiltration and the numbers each day , or each week , or each month . In some quarters of the year our indications are that they increase . In other periods of the year , the next quarter , they may go down Some . I know of nothing that I can conclude as highly significant from the guesses and the estimates that we have made . Just almost any step . As far as we can see , they have not taken any yet . And we would be glad to explore any reciprocal action that they or any of their spokesmen would care to suggest . We have made one proposal after the other . We would like to have a cease fire . We would be very glad to stop our bombing , as we have on two previous occasions , if we could have any indication of reciprocal action . But as of now they have given none . And I assume they are willing to give none until I hear further . Well , I have not given a lot of thought to you in the press . We have our problems with the press twice a day at our regular briefings . I try to meet with them at least twice a month , in some manner . And almost every day I see a collection of them on one subject or the other about something that interests them . I think our system requires that , and I always try to reciprocate their understanding . Now as for being President , I can only add to what I said the first day I was in this office I am going to do the very best I can . I need all the help that I can get . I think the country , and the Congress , and the other nations of the world have been very willing to be reasonable in their relations with me . I think all in all we have succeeded in obtaining some of our objectives . I go to bed every night feeling that I have failed that day because I could not end the conflict in Vietnam . I do have disappointments and moments of distress , as I think every President has had . But I am not complaining . And if you can endure it in the press , I will try to endure it in the Presidency . Yes , I think it is quite a different Congress . I think it is going to be a more partisan Congress . And I think that it is going to be more difficult to obtain favorable action on administration measures . I said after the first Congress after the election in 1964 that the President s mandate rarely lasted longer than 6 months , and I hoped that we could get most of the pledges we made in our platform enacted as soon as possible . I have never tabulated it , but I believe Senator Mansfield made the statement that the Congress has enacted about 85 percent of our platform . We still have some other things to pass . We will win some and we will lose some . We will try to work out an area of agreement where we can take some modified language in certain legislation we have to pass . I do not want to anticipate more difficulty than I need to . I am going to do with the Congress like I am trying to do with our adversaries in other places in the world I am going to say to the minority party , which I do think appears to be able to find fault with almost our every act , that I want to meet them halfway , and I want their cooperation . I want their help . Because I do not believe it is good for the country to have partisan political in fighting all the time . We ought to reserve a few weeks before the election for that , and then all of us work for America the rest of the time . I hope and believe that most Members of the Congress will feel that way . There are many obstacles that come in the way in our attempt to reach all of our objectives . I regret very much the incident to which your refer . I am very hopeful that the government concerned will take appropriate , just , and fair action . I am still determined that , notwithstanding some difficulties that may arise from time to time , that this is in the overall best interests of this country . And I am going to continue to try to work toward that goal . I have seen nothing that any of them have said that indicates any seriousness on their part . I am awaiting any offer they might care to make . They know that we are in contact with them . I cannot speak for them . But I am very anxious for them to make any proposal . And we will give it very prompt and serious consideration . Yes . We still have our problems , but I think they change from time to time . And I think there have been material changes in the thinking of various countries and their approach to their relations to other nations since World War II am very hopeful that we can continue to try to evolve a satisfactory formula for getting along in this world . And I am encouraged in that hope every day . I see more encouraging signs than I do discouraging ones along that line . I did not see Staebler . I do not know what he refers to . I think he would be a better person to make that reply than I am . The Democratic National Committee has a very competent chairman , vice chairman , chairman of the finance committee , and the deputy chairman . All of those people were in the committee when I came into the Presidency . While they have only had one national campaign since that time , it was very satisfactory so far as I am concerned . And I think some people have used the committee as a kind of whipping boy some of them that really did not understand the functions of the committee . I have worked on both the national committee , as an officer , and the congressional committee , as an officer , for many years . It has never been the function of the national committee to take over the congressional elections . We support them . We work with them . We aid them every way we can in the national committee . But there are not many Congressmen that want the Democratic national chairman to manage their campaigns in their local districts . And for that reason , we have a congressional committee and we have a senatorial committee . It is my judgment that those committees are well run , well operated . They did a good job this year . And I know the Democratic National Committee gave them more support and more assistance and more effort than we have given in any period in our history . So I do not know exactly what they are referring to . I think if they had a knowledge of the situation , they would not feel as badly as they do about the present membership . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen I am sending a message to the Congress this afternoon asking it to act speedily to restore the investment credit and the use of accelerated depreciation for buildings . I am asking that this be made effective as of today . You will recall that last fall , when I signed the legislation temporarily suspending these investment incentives , I said then , and I should like to quote now The legislation which I have signed provides for automatic restoration of these special tax provisions in January 1968 . If , however , any earlier reinstatement would be appropriate , I shall recommend prompt legislative action to accomplish that result . That action is appropriate today , and I am so recommending action today . Both the House and Senate committees which considered this legislation recognized the need to restore these incentives promptly once the suspension was no longer necessary . It is now clear that the temporary suspension of these investment incentives has done the job that we hoped and expected it would do . Interest rates began to decline last September immediately after this proposal was first submitted to the Congress . Since then , aided by actions of the Federal Reserve Board , interest rates have come down as much as 1 1 4 percentage points from their September peaks . Treasury bill rates are down from 5 . 59 percent in September to 4 . 34 percent yesterday . Interest rates on new municipal bonds are down from 4 . 24 percent in September to 3 . 60 percent now . Last spring and summer , savings and loan associations had virtually no new money whatever to lend to home builders and home buyers . In the past 4 months , they have been taking in deposits at a normal rate , and again have money to lend . So we are beginning to revive the homebuilding industry . Since the recommendations were made last September , the excessive pressure on our machinery industries has , we think , eased very dramatically . After rising 28 percent from September 1965 to September 1966 , order backlogs for capital goods have now already leveled off , and actually declined in January for the first time in more than 3 years . Last September , the machinery producers were operating close to 100 percent of capacity . Now their operations have moved down to a much healthier and much more efficient rate . The acute shortage of skilled machinists has now greatly moderated . Imports of capital equipment which had previously been climbing on an average of 14 percent a quarter , have already leveled off . So this evidence of moderation in our economy has now been confirmed by the survey of investment plans for 1967 conducted by the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission , which was released to you yesterday and published this morning . A moderate increase of 3 . 9 percent in capital outlay is planned for 1967 , according to these estimates . That is a very sharp contrast to the increases of 16 percent and 17 percent in the past 2 years . So the actions that we took last fall , with the cooperation of the Congress , have helped to do what we thought very much needed to be done . The imbalance in our economy that we were aiming at has now been righted . We said that we would restore the tax incentives when appropriate , and when the suspension was no longer needed . The suspension is no longer needed . I propose that we restore the investment incentives , effective today . I will be glad to take any questions . Smith , we have help and suggestions from Members of the Senate , and from leaders in public life throughout the Nation and throughout the world . I think all of us are very anxious to seek a peaceful settlement in Vietnam . As far as I am concerned , the sooner the better . We are ready to use any procedure that the other side is willing to engage in . We have stated our position a good many times the machinery of the Geneva Conference , the United Nations , an all Asian Conference , or any other appropriate forum . Individuals have different approaches to this matter . I have the benefit of a worldwide network of trained diplomats . I have the experience of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . I have the judgment and recommendations of the Cabinet , the Secretary of State , and Secretary of Defense . I have constant consultations with our allies in the world , in particular our allies engaged with us in Vietnam . On the basis of that information I must make judgments , and I do . Sometimes those judgments are different from what other people , if they were in this position , would make . I have no particular fault to find , or criticism to make , of others . I just must act in the light of the information I have , exercise the best judgment I can , and do what I think is best for this country . That is what I am doing without regard to personalities or politics . Yes . We have recommended a 6 percent surcharge . We see no reason to change that recommendation . The Ways and Means Committee is now busy considering legislation involving matters of deep concern to the administration , such as the social security bill . We think by the time they get to hearings on the tax bill , the administration will be able to make a very good case , based on the economy , based on all the factors that that Committee must consider . There are some doubts in Congress about the wisdom of it . We will have to debate those out . As of this time , I would see no reason why we should change the recommendations we made in our State of the Union Message . I have tried to make it abundantly clear to all the people of this country and all of the people of the world that we are prepared to talk without conditions , we are prepared to talk about conditions , or we will talk about a final settlement . I said to you I think the last time we met that this Government is always willing , anxious , and eager to go more than halfway . But I must call to the attention of you and the American people that I do not think that we can stop half the war while the other side continues to kill our men , to lob their mortars into our air bases , to seize South Vietnam by force . I just must repeat each day that we are ready to speak unconditionally or conditionally . The problem with all of those who love peace and I think most of us do is not with this Government . We are willing to go to a conference room any day . We are ready to go without stopping or after stopping if they are willing to do likewise , or if they are willing to make any concession . But I do not think it is fair to ask an American Commander in Chief to say to your men , Ground your planes , tie your hands behind you , sit there and watch division after division come across the DMand do not hit them until they get within a mile or two of you . I do not think that is fair to American Marines or American soldiers . We have talked before while acts of war continued . We did that in Korea . We had the blockade on in Berlin while we had conferences . So we are willing to talk unconditionally , or we are willing to talk conditionally . All we ask is equity and fairness , and that the other side do likewise . We do not think you ought to ask the American boys to do one thing while other folks do nothing . I think it is very difficult to speculate and give you a direct reply to that question . I think our men have given a very wonderful account of themselves . I no longer see any possibility of a military victory on the part of North Vietnam . I think they realize it . I think they are struggling desperately today to try to get a propaganda victory , and to try to bring world opinion and public opinion in this country to permit them to win here what they cannot win from our men out there . No , there is no truth that I am looking for a successor . Ambassador Lodge has talked to me on several occasions that he , in due time , would leave his post . He left it on one other occasion , took a rest and went back and served a tour of duty . There is no definite date set at this moment for his departure . I do expect to be visiting with Ambassador Lodge and with General Westmoreland , as we do from time to time . We will fully explore his future in Vietnam , or elsewhere , if he cares to do that . I do not think any of us are happy to see our Nation divided and see our country upset about situations such as Katzenbach is now studying . I think it would be better for all of us if we were united and if all of us could agree upon a wise course of action and be free of any mistakes , any errors . I regret very much some of the intemperate statements and some of the severe criticisms that have been made about various Government agencies , including the Central Intelligence Agency . I have asked the best people in the Government to study everything they have done and to make a report to me . I expect to receive that report sometime perhaps by the middle or the 20th of the month . Then I will review it and make such decisions as may be indicated . We have talked about reciprocal military action in every pause we have had , Bailey . We have had five pauses now . On the first pause of 5 days we made it very clear that we were taking this action and we would keep our ear to the receiver and listen intently for any indication from the enemy that he would take reciprocal action . He turned our letter back to us on the third day of that pause . Later , we had a 37 day pause . We were told before we went into that pause by some of the same people who are recommending a pause now , or urging a pause now , that if we would go into it for 12 days or at the most 20 days , we could get reciprocal action . We made it very clear that we would take the initiative and we would try to see if they were willing to pick up the telephone . We went 37 days . They gave us no indication that they were willing to take any reciprocal action . We have just finished a pause of 6 days during the Tet period . At the beginning of each of these pauses we made it clear that we were going to pause , ask our men to withhold action , and give them an opportunity to agree to come to conditional discussions , unconditional discussions , any kind of discussion . We have just completed that 6 day pause . So I would respond to your question by saying at the beginning of each pause we made it clear that we would take action , we would listen intently for action on their part . We have . We have heard the same story every time . I see nothing in any evidence that I have that would give me any indication that they have had a change of mind , or that they are willing to take any serious action to stop this war . I am searching every day . I am following every lead I can . I hope that we will find something at the beginning of every week . But I cannot give you any assurance now . Yes , I believe that the Russians genuinely want peace . I think that most people in the world want peace . Some want it on different terms . I am hoping that the day will come when we can find some area of agreement . But I do not think that that day is here yet . We will just continue to try . I think that it was evident from my statement that first , I think it is generally known that I am glad that interest rates have fallen and have come down . I think it is clear that they have been reduced from one half of a percent in some instances to 1 1 4 percent in others . I said in my statement today that that is in part due to the action of the Federal Reserve Board . I am pleased with the action the Chairman and other members of the Board took that contributed to that . I do not want to quarrel with anyone . I think it is rather dear to me that they have laid down conditions that to me mean that they insist that we agree to permanent cessation of bombing before they might talk . I think a good , general way to express it is what I said at my last press conference just almost any reciprocal action on their part . We have said that we would be glad to stop our invasion of North Vietnam if they would stop their invasion of South Vietnam . We would be glad to halt our bombing if they would halt their aggression and their infiltration . We are prepared to discuss anything that they are willing to discuss . But they are not willing to discuss anything , as of now . Yes , we have reached an agreement that is satisfactory to us and in our national interest in a number of fields . I do not think that I should take your time to enumerate them . But the consular agreement is one that is now being debated . Cultural exchange is another . The space agreement is another . We are working very diligently , although we do not know what results will be forthcoming , in connection with the nonproliferation treaty . Discussions will soon begin in connection with offensive and defensive nuclear weapons . Ambassador Thompson will participate in those discussions in Moscow . We have exchanged ideas , and views , and reached agreements to the benefit of both countries and both peoples . Well , I cannot speak for the opposition . I can only speak for myself . It has been many years since we had a thorough study of the draft such as we have had very recently by two distinguished panels , the Marshall commission and the General Clark commission . I think they made many good recommendations . I think there will be more yet to come that will flow from the debate in the Congress . Unquestionably , in the field of the Selective Service boards and the draft machinery , as in the general machinery of Government at all levels , there has been discrimination against minority groups . I will do all I can to see that that is corrected . I do not believe our people want to see that happen or want to see that continued . I expect that the system now being worked on by General Hershey and Secretary McNamara , when we issue our Executive order , will be a fair and impartial random selection . I realize that there are differing opinions . We will hear much of them during the extensive debate . But generally speaking , I agree with the conclusions reached by Marshall and his commission . I stated this in my message to the Congress . I want to hear the debate on the student deferment matter from both sides . The commission was divided on that question . And then I will reach a decision when the Congress has had a chance to act . I did not know , Miss Means , there had been that much speculation about it . I am not ready to make a decision about my future after January of 1969 at this time . I think that down the road several months from now would be the appropriate time for an announcement of my future plans . I have never known a public servant that I worked better with or for whom I had more admiration , or who I thought was more entitled to the public trust than the Vice President . I felt that way when I asked the convention in Atlantic City to select him . I feel even stronger about it today . Well , I am not sure that Presidents are objective viewers or listeners . I recall some very distinguished President not many years ago saying he was reading more and more , and liking it less and less . I guess all Presidents feel that way the longer they are in office . I do think that Komer brought back an optimistic appraisal of the situation in Vietnam . I think that we have made great progress there . It has been only 18 months since we sent our troops there . I do not think we can expect any quick , overnight success story . I will be receiving a report sometime later this month from both General Westmoreland in person , and from Ambassador Lodge , and from Porter and all of those engaged in Vietnam . We meet about every 6 months . We will review in some detail our weaknesses out there and they are legion as well as our strengths . I am very proud of what the United States Government has been able to do in the last 18 months in that area . I am very sure of victory . I am very grateful to the men who are making sacrifices to bring it about . Yes . I have ordered a directive prepared . The lawyers are working on it now . Perhaps the secretary is typing it . I will send later today a directive to the Attorney General to proceed on a Taft Hartley injunction . I think as you know , the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service over the past 4 months has worked rather intensively but they have been unable to resolve this very difficult labor dispute . The Secretaries of Defense and Labor and the Attorney General have recommended that I establish an emergency board . I understand the Attorney General will very likely go to court in San Francisco perhaps tomorrow morning on the matter . Just at any point that I had an opportunity , that I had a signal from the other side , of what their intentions were , what they were willing to do . They have taken a rather steadfast position . There has been little flexibility in it . If I could get any sign from them or any indication from them that they were anxious to stop the war , that they were serious about it , that they were willing to talk unconditionally or conditionally , I would act very promptly . Second , so far as the critics of the Vietnam situation are concerned , I must grant to them the same sincerity that I reserve for myself . Now as to the extent of their information , I think that varies . I think some men have more than others . Some men have more opportunity to have it than others . I am just not in a position to know how much information each critic of my policy in Vietnam happens to have at the time he makes his criticism . I might say that it seems obvious to me that some of them do need more information sometimes . Because when they make suggestions following a course of action that we have just completed , it makes me wish that all this information was available to everybody who is assuming responsibilities in the matter . No , I expect we will meet them in the Pacific area somewhere . I would expect it would be perhaps sometime this month . I have had reports from them . I think we have a very difficult undertaking . I think it has been a very close question since the original target date was set . I am very hopeful we will be able to keep it . I do not think there is any guarantee that we will at all . Yes . Our people are always very anxious that every one of our men have the best and most modern equipment available at all times . I have scrupulously inquired of General Westmoreland if our men are short of any supplies or any equipment at any time . He has assured me that they have been amply equipped and amply taken care of . We have , from time to time , helped other nations . Some of the equipment we have had has gone to them . Whether or not any equipment that has gone to them was desperately needed in any other theater , I would doubt . I think that we can rely on commanders of the stature of General Westmoreland . I think he is closer to the scene . I think he knows more about it . I think he is a better authority . While I do not question either the purpose or the sincerity of the individuals who assume to make suggestions in this area and I will carefully consider them at the present time I am going to rely on General Westmoreland s judgment unless somebody gives me something better . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>President , Chancellor , President Adolfo Lopez Mateos and Mateos , Senator Kuchel , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , ladies and gentlemen It is altogether appropriate that in this place of learning we should honor President Lopez Mateos . His qualities of mind and heart have made him the leader of Mexico and an example of the hemisphere a product of revolution and an architect of freedom . The universities and institutes of his own country are attracting young men and women from every continent , and this is testimony to the vigor of Mexican intellectual and scientific achievement . Like other great colleges and universities in this country , the University of California is deeply committed to the enrichment and the diversity of American life . This university has its own cherished links with Mexico , and just as I am proud to claim Adolfo Lopez Mateos as my personal friend , the people of the United States , as Governor Brown has told you , are proud of their enduring friendship with our neighboring nation , Mexico . In the winning of our independence , in the strengthening of our institutions , in the relentless quest of social justice and human rights , in the pursuit of a better way of life for all of our people , Mexico and the United States have walked a common road . Others walk that road today , and our experience , President , enables us to understand their hopes , for neither Mexico nor the United States leaped into the modern world full grown we are both the products of inspired men who built new liberty out of old oppression and , President , neither of our revolutions is yet finished . So long as there remains a man without a job , a family without a roof , a child without a school , we have much to do . No American can rest while any American is denied his rights because of the color of his skin . No American conscience can be at peace while any American is jobless , hungry , uneducated , and ignored . Our permanent revolution is dedicated so broadening , for all Americans , the material and the spiritual benefits of the democratic heritage . But while we pursue these unfinished tasks at home , we must look also at the larger scene of world affairs . Our constant aim , our steadfast purpose , our undeviating policy , is to do all that strengthens the hope of peace , and nothing will ever make us weary in these tasks . In our foreign policy today there is room neither for complacency nor for alarm . The world has become small and turbulent . New challenges knock daily at the White House , America s front door . In South Viet Nam , terror and violence , directed and supplied by outside enemies , press against the lives and the liberties of a people who seek only to be left in peace . for 10 years our country has been committed to the support of their freedom , and that commitment we will continue to honor . The contest in which South Viet Nam is now engaged is first and foremost a contest to be won by the government and the people of that country for themselves . But those engaged in external direction and supply would do well to be reminded and to remember that this type of aggression is a deeply dangerous game . For every American it is a source of sadness that the two communities in Cyprus are today set against each other . America s partnership with Europe began with President Truman s brave pledge of assistance to Greece and Turkey . Now the people of Cyprus , closely tied to these two friends and allies , our partners in NATstand at the edge of tragedy . Of course , the United States , though not a party to the issues , will do everything we possibly can to find a solution , a peaceful solution . So I appeal for an end to the bloodshed , before it is too late , to everyone in Cyprus and to all interested parties around the world . It is the task of statesmanship to prevent the danger in Cyprus from exploding into disaster . Closer to home , we ourselves seek a settlement with our friends in Panama . We give assurance to the government and to the people of Panama that the United States of America is determined to be absolutely fair in all discussions on all our problems . We are prepared , calmly and without pressure , to consider all the problems which exist between us , and to try our dead level best to find a solution to them promptly . What is needed now is a covenant of cooperation . As we are patient in Panama , we are prepared at Guantanamo . We have dealt with the latest challenge and provocation from Havana , without sending the Marines to turn on a water faucet . We believed it far wiser to send an admiral to cut the water off than to send a battalion of Marines to turn it back on . We are making our base more secure than it has ever been in its history . I have chosen today to speak of the dangers of today . If we were to solve them all tomorrow , then there will be more next week . But the weather vane of headlines is not the signpost of history . Larger than the troubles I have noted is the spreading civil war among the Communists . And larger still is the steadily growing strength of the worldwide community of freedom . The power of the free community has never been greater . On the tactics of the day we sometimes differ with the best of our friends , but in our commitment to freedom we are united . Here in North America , for example , we speak in English , in Spanish , and in french , and all are the tongues of liberty . Here in this hemisphere , as we work together on the great opportunities for the Alliance for Progress , we can surely join in extending a warm welcome to friends in Europe who offer help in our progress and markets for our products . We seek a growing partnership with all our friends , and we will never retreat from our obligations to any ally . Nor will we ever be intimidated by any state , anywhere , at any time , in the world that chooses to make itself our adversary . There is no panic on our agenda . We are interested in the deeds of our adversaries , and not their creeds . Let them offer deeds of peace and our response will be swift . So let us go forward with undaunted purpose in the healing of the nations . for America today , as in Jefferson s time , peace must be our passion . It is not enough for America to be a sentinel on the frontiers of freedom . America must also be on the watchtower seeking out the horizons of peace . We are not alone as servants and guardians of these high causes . Yet on us as a people and government has fallen a solemn burden . We shall never weary under its weight . So let us , with brave hearts and with cool heads , advance with the task of building the citadels of peace , in a world that is set free from fear . Thank you .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans On Thursday of last week , from the Kremlin in Moscow , the Soviet Government announced a change in its leadership . On Friday of last week , Communist China exploded a nuclear device on an isolated test site in Sinkiang . Both of these important events make it right that your President report to you as fully and as clearly and as promptly as he can . That is what I mean to do this evening . Now , let me begin with events in Moscow . We do not know exactly what happened to Nikita Khrushchev last Thursday . We do know that he has been forced out of power by his former friends and colleagues . Five days ago he had only praise in Moscow . Today we learn only of his faults . Yet the men at the top today are the same men that he picked for leadership . These men carried on the administration of the Soviet Government when he was absent from the Soviet capital , and that was nearly half of the time that he was in power . Khrushchev was clearly the dominant figure in making Soviet policy . After Lenin and Stalin , he is only the third man in history to have made himself the undisputed master of Communist Russia . There were times when he was guilty of dangerous adventure . It required great American firmness and good sense first in Berlin and later in the Cuban missile crisis to turn back his threats and actions without war . Yet he learned from his mistakes and he was not blind to realities . In the last 2 years , his government had shown itself aware of the need for sanity in the nuclear age . He joined in the nuclear test ban treaty . He joined in the hot line which can help prevent a war by accident . He agreed that space should be kept free of nuclear weapons . In these actions he demonstrated good sense and sober judgment . We do not think it was these actions that led to his removal . We cannot know for sure just what did lead to this secret decision . Our intelligence estimate is that Khrushchev learned of the decision only when for him it was too late . There has been discontent and strain and failure both within the Soviet Union and within the Communist bloc as a whole . All of this has been evident for all to see . These troubles are not the creation of one man . They will not end with his removal . When Lenin died in 1924 , Stalin took four years to consolidate his power . When Stalin died in 1953 , it was not Khrushchev who first emerged . But two men now share top responsibility in the Soviet Union , and their exact relation to each other and to their colleagues is not yet very clear . They are experienced , but younger men , and perhaps less rooted in the past . They are said to be realistic . We can hope that they will share with us our great objective the prevention of nuclear war . But what does all this mean for us in America It means at least four things First , we must never forget that the men in the Kremlin remain dedicated , dangerous Communists . A time of trouble among Communists requires steady vigilance among free men and most of all among Americans . For it is the strength of the United States that holds the balance firm against danger . Second , there will be turmoil in the Communist world . It is likely that the men in the Kremlin will be concerned primarily with problems of communism . This would not be all good , because there are problems and issues that need attention between our world and theirs . But it is not all bad , because men who are busy with internal problems may not be tempted to reckless external acts . Third , this great change will not stop the forces in Eastern Europe that are working for greater independence . Those forces will continue to have our sympathy . We will not give up our hope of building new bridges to these peoples . Fourth , our own course must continue to prove that we on our side are ready to get on with the work of peace . The new Soviet Government has officially informed me , through Ambassador Dobrynin , day before yesterday , that it plans no change in basic foreign policy . I spoke frankly , as always , to the Soviet Ambassador . I told him that the quest for peace in America had never been more determined than it is now . I told him that we intend to bury no one , and we do not intend to be buried . I reminded the Ambassador of the danger that we all faced 2 years ago in Cuba . I told him that any Soviet Government which is ready to work for peace will find us ready in America . I said to the Ambassador that I would be ready to talk to anyone , when it would help the cause of peace . I believe that this was a good beginning , on both sides . That same day the Chinese nuclear device was exploded at a test site near a lake called Lop Nor , in the Takla Makan desert of the remote Central Asian province of Sinkiang . The building of this test site had been known to our American intelligence for several years . In recent weeks the rapid pace of work there gave us a quite clear signal that the long and bitter efforts of this regime were leading at last to a nuclear test . At first , in the 1950s , Russia helped the Chinese . This assistance in the spread of nuclear weapons may now be regarded with some dismay in Moscow . We believe that this help was ended in 1960 as the quarrel among the Communists grew sharper . Soviet technicians left suddenly , with their blueprints under their arms . And the unfinished facilities were just left there standing , and the expected supplies were cut off . But the Red Chinese kept to their chosen purpose , even as their economic plans collapsed and the suffering of their people increased . Our own distinguished Secretary of State , Rusk , gave timely warning as the preparations at Lop Nor advanced . And when the test occurred , I at once told the world that this explosion will not turn Americans and other free peoples from their steady purpose . No American should treat this matter lightly . Until this week , only four powers had entered the dangerous world of nuclear explosions . Whatever their differences , all four are sober and serious states , with long experience as major powers in the modern world . Communist China has no such experience . Its nuclear pretensions are both expensive and cruel to its people . It fools no one when it offers to trade away its first small accumulation of nuclear power against the mighty arsenals of those who limit Communist Chinese ambitions . It shocks us by its readiness to pollute the atmosphere with fallout . But this explosion remains a fact , sad and serious . We must not , we have not , and we will not ignore it . I discussed the limited meaning of this event in a statement on last Friday . The world already knows that we were not surprised , that our defense plans take full account of this development , that we reaffirm our defense commitments in Asia , that it is a long , hard road from a first nuclear device to an effective weapons system , and that our strength is overwhelming now and will be kept that way . But what I have in my mind tonight is a different part of the meaning of this explosion at Lop Nor . Communist China s expensive and demanding effort tempts other states to equal folly . Nuclear spread is dangerous to all mankind . What if there should come to be 10 nuclear powers , or maybe 20 nuclear powers What if we must learn to look everywhere for the restraint which our own example now sets for a few Will the human race be safe in such a day The lesson of Lop Nor is that we are right to recognize the danger of nuclear spread that we must continue to work against it , and we will . First , we will continue to support the limited test ban treaty , which has made the air cleaner . We call on the world especially Red China to join the nations which have signed that treaty . Second , we will continue to work for an ending of all nuclear tests of every kind , by solid and verified agreement . Third , we continue to believe that the struggle against nuclear spread is as much in the Soviet interest as in our own . We will be ready to join with them and all the world in working to avoid it . Fourth , the nations that do not seek national nuclear weapons can be sure that if they need our strong support against some threat of nuclear blackmail , then they will have it . The two events I have discussed are large and full of meaning , and I will discuss them at some length tomorrow with the legislative leaders of both parties . They are coming here to the White House for a full and complete briefing tomorrow afternoon . Yet they do not change our basic policy . They just reinforce it . Now let me take a minute to say that the same thing is true about another important event this week . It is the victory of another party with another leader in Great Britain . The British Labor Party is the same party that held power when the Atlantic Alliance was founded when British and American pilots flew the Berlin Airlift together when Englishmen joined us in Korea . It is a party of freedom , of democracy , and of good faith . Today it has the confidence of the British people . It also has ours . They are our friends as the Conservatives before them are our friends and as governments of both parties have been friends for generations . We congratulate the winners . We send warm regards to the losers . The friendship of our two nations goes on . This is our way with all our trusted allies . This has been an eventful week in the affairs of the world . It is not the first such week , nor will it be the last . For the world has changed many times in the last 20 years . Great leaders have come and gone . Old enemies have become new friends . Danger has taken the place of danger . Through this period we have steadily moved toward a more hopeful world . We have moved toward widening freedom and toward securing a more lasting peace . We will continue in this direction . What happens in other countries is important . But the key to peace is to be found in the strength and the good sense of the United States of America . Tonight we are the strongest nation in all the world , and the world knows it . We love freedom and we will protect it and we will preserve it . Tonight , as always , America s purpose is peace for all men . Almost 11 months ago , at a still more fateful hour , just after I had assumed the Presidency , I spoke to all of the Congress and to our people of the purpose of America . Let me close tonight by repeating what I said then We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest . This is the path that we shall continue to pursue . Those who test our courage will find it strong , and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable . We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength and the just can be strong in the defense of justice . Thank you and good night to all of you . My fellow Americans On Thursday of last week , from the Kremlin in Moscow , the Soviet Government announced a change in its leadership . On Friday of last week , Communist China exploded a nuclear device on an isolated test site in Sinkiang . Both of these important events make it right that your President report to you as fully and as clearly and as promptly as he can . That is what I mean to do this evening . Now , let me begin with events in Moscow . We do not know exactly what happened to Nikita Khrushchev last Thursday . We do know that he has been forced out of power by his former friends and colleagues . Five days ago he had only praise in Moscow . Today we learn only of his faults . Yet the men at the top today are the same men that he picked for leadership . These men carried on the administration of the Soviet Government when he was absent from the Soviet capital , and that was nearly half of the time that he was in power . Khrushchev was clearly the dominant figure in making Soviet policy . After Lenin and Stalin , he is only the third man in history to have made himself the undisputed master of Communist Russia . There were times when he was guilty of dangerous adventure . It required great American firmness and good sense first in Berlin and later in the Cuban missile crisis to turn back his threats and actions without war .

Thank you and good night to all of you .<speech_sep>Paul Miller and my fellow Americans Last Friday I talked to the editors of the leading newspapers of this land and today I am honored to appear before their bosses . This is the kind of a distinguished gathering that reminds me of a meeting in the Cabinet Room the other day . Around that Cabinet table sat three Harvard men , two Yale men , Dean Rusk and three other Rhodes Scholars , and one graduate of the Southwest Texas State Teachers College . It is good to be here in this great city that gave our Nation one of the great artists of repartee that we know as Al Smith . Once Al Smith was making a speech in this city and a heckler yelled , Tell them all you know , Al . It will not take long . And Al , without any hesitation , answered , I will tell them all we both know and it will not take any longer . Today I want to talk about something that we both know about . To you serious and concerned men , who have gathered here at this luncheon , and ladies , I want to speak about the problems and the potentials that lie ahead and the great purpose to which you and and all Americans , must be dedicated . The world has changed many times since General Washington counseled his new and weak country to observe good faith and justice toward all nations . Great empires have risen and dissolved . Great heroes have made their entrances and have left the stage . And America has slowly , often reluctantly , grown to be a great power and a leading member of world society . So we seek today , as we did in Washington s time , to protect the life of our Nation , to preserve the liberty of our citizens , and to pursue the happiness of our people . This is the touchstone of our world policy . Thus , we seek to add no territory to our dominion , no satellites to our orbit , no slavish followers to our policies . The most impressive witness to this restraint is that for a century our own frontiers have stood quiet and stood unarmed . But we have also learned in this century , and we have learned it at painful and bloody cost , that our own freedom depends upon the freedom of others , that our own protection requires that we help protect others , that we draw increased strength from the strength of others . Thus , to allies we are the most dependable and enduring of friends , for our own safety depends upon the strength of that friendship . To enemies we are the most steadfast and determined of foes , for we know that surrender anywhere threatens defeat everywhere . for a generation , without regard to party or region or class , our country has been united in a basic foreign policy that grows from this inescapable teaching . The principles of this foreign policy have been shaped in battle , have been tested in danger , have been sustained in achievement . They have endured under four Presidents of the United States , because they reflect the realities of our world and they reflect the aims of our country . Particular actions must change as events change conditions . We must be alert to shifting realities , to emerging opportunities , and always alert to any fresh dangers . But we must not mistake day to day changes for fundamental movements in the course of history . It very often requires greater courage and resolution to maintain a policy which time has tested , than to change it in the face of the moment s pressures . Our foreign policy rests on very tested principles . First , since Korea , we have labored to build a military strength of unmatched might . We have succeeded . If the threat of war has lessened , it is largely because our opponents realize that attack would bring destruction . This effort has been costly . But the costs of weakness are far greater than the costs of strength , and the payment far more painful . That is why , in the last 3 years , your Government has strengthened the whole range of America s defenses . We have increased defense spending in these 3 years by approximately 6 billion a year over the last year of the Eisenhower administration , and this year we are spending approximately 8 billion more on defense than we were during that last year . Second , we have strongly resisted Communist efforts to extend their dominion and successfully resisted efforts to expand their power . We have taken the risks and we have used the power which this principle demanded . We have avoided purposeless provocation and we have avoided needless adventure . The Berlin airlift , the Korean war , the defense of Formosa , the Cuba crisis , the struggle in Viet Nam , prove our determination to resist aggression and prove our ability to adapt particular response to particular challenge . Third , we have worked for the revival of strength among our allies , initially , to oppose Communist encroachment on warweakened nations in the long run , because our own future rests on the vitality and the unity of the Western society to which we belong . Fourth , we have encouraged the independence and the progress of developing countries . We are safer and we are more comfortable in a world where all people can govern themselves in their own way , and where all nations have the inner strength to resist external domination . Fifth , we have pursued every hope of a lasting peace . from the Baruch plan , named after that noble resident of this city , to the test ban treaty , we have sought and we have welcomed agreements which decrease danger without decreasing security . In that pursuit , for 20 years we have been the leading power in the support of the United Nations . In that pursuit , this year as in every year we will work to reach agreement on measures to reduce armament and lessen the chance of war . Today we apply these same principles in a world that is much changed since 1945 . Europe seeks a new role for strength rather than contenting itself with protection for weakness . The unity of communism is being eroded by the insistent forces of nationalism and diverging interest . A whole new group of societies is painfully struggling toward the modern world . Our basic principles are adequate to this shifting world . But foreign policy is more than just a set of general principles . It is the changing application of those principles to specific dangers and to specific opportunities . It involves knowledge of strengths and awareness of limitations in each new situation . The presence of offensive missiles in Cuba was a fact . The presence of fallout in the atmosphere has been a fact . The presence of guerrillas in Viet Nam , at this hour , is a fact . Such facts cannot be dealt with simply by historical judgments or general precepts . They require concrete acts of courage , and wisdom , and often restraint . These qualities of endurance and innovation , these qualities of continuity and change are at work in at least six major areas of continuing concern to you . First , is our relationship with the Soviet Union , the center of our concern for peace . Communists , using force and intrigue , seek to bring about a Communist dominated world . Our convictions , our interests , our life as a nation , demand that we resolutely oppose , with all of our might , that effort to dominate the world . This , and this alone , is the cause of the cold war between us . For the United States has nothing to fear from peaceful competition . We welcome it and we will win it . It is our system which flourishes and grows stronger in a world free from the threat of war . And in such a competition all people , everywhere , will be the gainers . Today , as we meet here , there are new pressures , new realities , which make it permissible to hope that the pursuit of peace is in the interests of the Soviet Union as it is in ours . And our own restraint may be convincing the Soviet leaders of the reality that we , in America , seek neither war nor the destruction of the Soviet Union . Thus I am very hopeful that we can take important steps toward the day when , in the words of the Old Testament , nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war anymore . We must remember that peace will not come suddenly . It will not emerge dramatically from a single agreement or a single meeting . It will be advanced by concrete and limited accommodations , by the gradual growth of common interests , by the increased awareness of shifting dangers and alignments , and by the development of trust in a good faith based on a reasoned view of the world . Our own position is clear . We will discuss any problem , we will listen to any proposal , we will pursue any agreement , we will take any action which might lessen the chance of war without sacrificing the interests of our allies or our own ability to defend the alliance against attack . In other words , our guard is up , but our hand is out . I am taking two actions today which reflect both our desire to reduce tension and our unwillingness to risk weakness . I have ordered a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched uranium , to be carried out over a 4 year period . When added to previous reductions , this will mean an overall decrease in the production of plutonium by 20 percent , and of enriched uranium by 4 deg percent . By bringing production in line with need , and the chart shows now that our production is here , and our need is here , and our reduction today will bring it here , we think we will reduce tension while we maintain all the necessary power . We must not operate a WPnuclear project , just to provide employment when our needs have been met . And in reaching these decisions I have been in close consultation with Prime Minister Douglas Home . Simultaneously with my announcement now , Chairman Khrushchev is releasing a statement in Moscow , at 2 of the clock our time , in which he makes definite commitments to steps toward a more peaceful world . He agrees to discontinue the construction of two big new atomic reactors for the production of plutonium over the next several years , to reduce substantially the production of U235 for nuclear weapons , and to allocate more fissionable material for peaceful uses . This is not disarmament . This is not a declaration of peace . But it is a hopeful sign and it is a step forward which we welcome and which we can take in the hope that the world may yet , one day , live without the fear of war . At the same time , I have reaffirmed all the safeguards against weakening our nuclear strength which we adopted at the time of the test ban treaty . The second area of continuing effort is the development of Atlantic partnership with a stronger and a more unified Europe . Having begun this policy when peril was great , we will not now abandon it as success moves closer . We worked for a stronger and more prosperous Europe , and Europe is strong and prosperous today because of our work and beyond our expectation . We have supported a close partnership with a more unified Europe and in the past 15 years more peaceful steps have been taken in this direction than have been taken at any time in our history . The pursuit of this goal , like the pursuit of any large and worthy cause , will not be easy or will not be untroubled . But the realities of the modern world teach that increased greatness and prosperity demand increased unity and partnership . The underlying forces of European life are eroding old barriers and they are dissolving old suspicions . Common institutions are expanding common interests . National boundaries continue to fade under the impact of travel and commerce and communication . A new generation is coming of age , unscarred by old hostilities or old ambitions , thinking of themselves as Europeans , their values shaped by a common Western culture . These forces and the steadfast effort of all who share common goals will shape the future . And unity based on hope will ultimately prove stronger than unity based on fear . We realize that sharing the burden of leadership requires us to share the responsibilities of power . As a step in this direction we support the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force composed of those nations which desire to participate . We also welcome agreed new mechanisms for political consultation on mutual interests throughout the world with whatever changes in organization are necessary to make such consultation rapid and effective . The experience of two world wars have taught us that the fundamental security interests of the United States and of Europe are the same . What we learned in time of war , we must not now forget in time of peace . for more than a decade we have sought to enlarge the independence and ease the rigors of the people of Eastern Europe . We have used the tools of peaceful exchange in goods , in persons , and in ideas to open up communication with these restless nations that Khrushchev refers to , sometimes , as children who have grown up too big to spank . We have used limited direct assistance where the needs of our security have allowed us to follow the demands of our compassion . In that spirit within the last month I have exercised the power granted the President by the Congress and I have reaffirmed the right of open trade with Poland and Yugoslavia . In the third area of continuing concern , Latin America , we have renewed our commitment to the Alliance for Progress , we have sought peaceful settlement of disputes among the American nations , and we have supported the OAS effort to isolate Communist controlled Cuba . The Alliance for Progress is the central task today of this hemisphere . That task is going ahead successfully . But that alliance means more than economic assistance or investment . It requires us to encourage and to support those democratic political forces which seek essential change within the framework of constitutional government . It means preference for rapid evolution as the only real alternative to violent revolution . To struggle to stand still in Latin America is just to throw the sand against the wind . We must , of course , always be on guard against Communist subversion . But anticommunism alone will never suffice to ensure our liberty or never suffice to fulfill our dreams . That is going to take leadership , leadership that is dedicated to economic progress without uneconomic privilege , to social change which enhances social justice , to political reform which widens human freedom . The resumption of relations with Panama proves once again the unmatched ability of our inter American system to resolve these disputes among our good neighbors . At the outset of that dispute with Panama , the first morning I stated to the President of Panama by telephone our willingness to seek a solution to all problems without conditions of any kind . And I told him that our negotiators would meet theirs anywhere , any time , to discuss anything , and we would do what was fair and just and right . We never departed from that willingness . And on that basis the dispute was settled . We now move toward solution with the generosity of friends who realize , as Woodrow Wilson once said , You cannot be friends on any other terms than upon the terms of equality . The use of Cuba as a base for subversion and terror is an obstacle to our hopes for the Western Hemisphere . Our first task must be , as it has been , to isolate Cuba from the inter American system , to frustrate its efforts to destroy free governments , and to expose the weakness of communism so that all can see . That policy is in effect and that policy is working . The problems of this hemisphere would be far more serious if Castro today sat at the councils of the Organization of American States disrupting debate and blocking decision , if Castro had open channels of trade and communication along which subversion and terror could flow , it his economy had been a successful model rather than a dismal warning to all of his neighbors . The effectiveness of our policy is more than a matter of trade statistics . It has increased awareness of difference and danger , it has revealed the brutal nature of the Cuban regime , it has lessened opportunities for subversion , it has reduced the number of Castro s followers , and it has drained the resources of our adversaries who are spending more than 1 million a day . We will continue this policy with every peaceful means at our command . A fourth area of continuity and change is the battle for freedom in the far East . In the last 20 years , in two wars , millions of Americans have fought to prevent the armed conquest of free Asia . Having invested so heavily in the past , we will not weaken in the present . The first American diplomatic mission to the far East was instructed to inform all countries that we will never make conquests , or ask any nation to let us establish ourselves in their countries . That was our policy in 1832 . That is our policy in 1964 . Our conquering forces left Asia after World War II with less territory under our flag than ever before . But if we have desired no conquest for ourselves , we have also steadfastly opposed it for others . The independence of Asian nations is a link in our own freedom . In Korea we proved the futility of direct aggression . In Viet Nam the Communists today try the more insidious , but the equally dangerous , methods of subversion , terror , and guerrilla warfare . They conduct a campaign organized , directed , supplied , and supported from Hanoi . This , too , we will prove futile . Armed Communist attack on Viet Nam is today a reality . The fighting spirit of South Viet Nam , as Secretary Rusk told us from there yesterday , is a reality . The request of a friend and an ally for our help in this terrible moment is a reality . The statement of the SEATO allies that Communist defeat is essential is a reality . To fail to respond to these realities would reflect on our honor as a nation , would undermine worldwide confidence in our courage , would convince every nation in South Asia that it must now bow to Communist terms to survive . The situation in Viet Nam is difficult . But there is an old American saying that when the going gets tough , the tough get going . So let no one doubt that we are in this battle as long as South Viet Nam wants our support and needs our assistance to protect its freedom . I have already ordered measures to step up the fighting capacity of the South Vietnamese forces , to help improve the welfare and the morale of their civilian population , to keep our forces at whatever level continued independence and freedom require . No negotiated settlement in Viet Nam is possible , as long as the Communists hope to achieve victory by force . Once war seems hopeless , then peace may be possible . The door is always open to any settlement which assures the independence of South Viet Nam , and its freedom to seek help for its protection . In Laos we continue to support the Geneva agreements which offer what we think is the best hope of peace and independence for that strife torn land . At my instruction yesterday Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy went to Laos , and he has already arrived there for a first hand examination of the developments , the developments that have come in the last 48 hours . At the moment we are encouraged by reports of progress toward the reestablishment of orderly , legal government . As for China itself , so long as the Communist Chinese pursue aggression , so long as the Communist Chinese preach violence , there can be and will be no easing of relationships . There are some who prophesy that these policies will change . But America must base her acts on present realities and not on future hopes . It is not we who must reexamine our view of China . It is the Chinese Communists who must reexamine their view of the world . Nor can anyone doubt our unalterable commitment to the defense and the liberty of free China . Meanwhile , we will say to our historic friends , the talented and courageous Chinese people on the mainland , that just as we opposed aggression against them , we must oppose aggression by their rulers and for the same reasons . Fifth , is our concern with the new nations of Africa and Asia . We welcome their emergence , for their goals flow from hopes like our own . We began the revolt from colonial rule which is now reshaping other continents and which is now creating new nations . Our mastery of technology has helped men to learn that poverty is not inevitable , that disease and hunger are not laws of nature . Having helped create these hopes , we must now help satisfy them , or we will witness a rising discontent which may ultimately menace our own welfare . What we desire for the developing nations is what we desire for ourselves economic progress which will permit them to shape their own institutions , and the independence which will allow them to take a dignified place in the world community . So let there be no mistake about our intention to win the war against poverty at home , and let there be no mistake about our intention to fight that war around the world . This battle will not be easy or it will not be swift . It takes time to educate young minds and to shape the structure of a modern economy . But the world must not be divided into rich nations and poor nations , or white nations or colored nations . In such divisions , I know you must realize , stand the seeds of terrible discord and danger in the decades ahead . for the wall between rich and poor is a wall of glass through which all can see . We recognize the need for more stable prices for raw materials , for broader opportunity for trade among nations . We are ready to help meet these claims , as we have already done , for example , with the negotiation of the International Coffee Agreement , and as we will do in the weeks ahead in the Kennedy Round . We will continue with the direct economic assistance which has been a vital part of our policy for more than 20 years . Last year the Congress reduced foreign aid from an original request of 4 . 9 billion , later modified by General Clay s committee1 to 4 . 5 billion , and Congress reduced that to a total of 3 . 4 billion that they appropriated to me to deal with the problems of the 120 nations . This year I ordered that our request be cut to the absolute minimum consistent with our commitments and our security , allowing for no cushions or no padding , and that was done . 1 Committee to Strengthen the Security of the free World . Every dollar cut from that request for 3 . 4 billion will directly diminish the security of the United States and you citizens . And if , in spite of this clear need and this clear warning , substantial cuts are made again this year in either military or economic funds , I want to sound a warning that it will be my solemn duty as President to submit supplemental requests for additional amounts until the necessary funds of 3 . 4 billion are appropriated . In these areas , and in other areas of concern , we remain faithful to tested principle and deep conviction while shaping our actions to shifting dangers and to fresh opportunity . This year is an election year in the United States . And in this year let neither friend nor enemy abroad ever mistake growing discussion for growing dissension , or conflict over programs for conflict over principles , or political division for political paralysis . This mistake in judgment has been made twice in our lifetime , to the sorrow of our adversaries . Now let those at home , who share in the great democratic struggle , remember that the world is their audience and that attack and opposition to old policies must not be just for opposition s sake , that it requires responsible presentation of new choices , that in the protection of our security , the protection of American security , partisan politics must always yield to national need . I recognize that those who seek to discuss great public issues in this election year must be informed on those issues . Therefore , I have today instructed the Departments of State and Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency to be prepared and to provide all major candidates for the office of President with all possible information helpful to their discussion of American policy . I hope candidates will accept this offer in the spirit in which it is made the encouragement of the responsible discussion which is the touchstone of the democratic process . In the past 20 years we have gradually become aware that America is forever bound up in the affairs of the whole world . Our own future is linked to the future of all . In great capitals and in tiny villages , in the councils of great powers and in the rooms of unknown planners , events are being set in motion which will continually call upon our attention and make demands on our resources , Prophecy is always unsure . But if anything is certain , it is that this Nation can never again retreat from world responsibility . You must know , and we must realize , that we will be involved in the world for the rest of our history . We must accustom ourselves to working for liberty in the community of nations as we have pursued it in our community of States . The struggle is not merely long . The struggle is unending . for it is part of man s ancient effort to master the passions of his mind , the demands of his spirit , the cruelties of nature . Yes , we have entered a new arena . The door has closed behind us . And the old stage has passed into history . Dangers will replace dangers , challenges will take the place of challenges , new hopes will come as old hopes fade . There is no turning from a course which will require wisdom and much endurance so long as the name of America still sounds in this land and around the world . Paul Miller and my fellow Americans Last Friday I talked to the editors of the leading newspapers of this land and today I am honored to appear before their bosses . This is the kind of a distinguished gathering that reminds me of a meeting in the Cabinet Room the other day . Around that Cabinet table sat three Harvard men , two Yale men , Dean Rusk and three other Rhodes Scholars , and one graduate of the Southwest Texas State Teachers College . It is good to be here in this great city that gave our Nation one of the great artists of repartee that we know as Al Smith . Once Al Smith was making a speech in this city and a heckler yelled , Tell them all you know , Al . It will not take long . And Al , without any hesitation , answered , I will tell them all we both know and it will not take any longer . Today I want to talk about something that we both know about . To you serious and concerned men , who have gathered here at this luncheon , and ladies , I want to speak about the problems and the potentials that lie ahead and the great purpose to which you and and all Americans , must be dedicated . The world has changed many times since General Washington counseled his new and weak country to observe good faith and justice toward all nations . Great empires have risen and dissolved . Great heroes have made their entrances and have left the stage . And America has slowly , often reluctantly , grown to be a great power and a leading member of world society . So we seek today , as we did in Washington s time , to protect the life of our Nation , to preserve the liberty of our citizens , and to pursue the happiness of our people . This is the touchstone of our world policy . Thus , we seek to add no territory to our dominion , no satellites to our orbit , no slavish followers to our policies . The most impressive witness to this restraint is that for a century our own frontiers have stood quiet and stood unarmed . But we have also learned in this century , and we have learned it at painful and bloody cost , that our own freedom depends upon the freedom of others , that our own protection requires that we help protect others , that we draw increased strength from the strength of others . Thus , to allies we are the most dependable and enduring of friends , for our own safety depends upon the strength of that friendship . To enemies we are the most steadfast and determined of foes , for we know that surrender anywhere threatens defeat everywhere . for a generation , without regard to party or region or class , our country has been united in a basic foreign policy that grows from this inescapable teaching . The principles of this foreign policy have been shaped in battle , have been tested in danger , have been sustained in achievement . They have endured under four Presidents of the United States , because they reflect the realities of our world and they reflect the aims of our country . Particular actions must change as events change conditions . We must be alert to shifting realities , to emerging opportunities , and always alert to any fresh dangers . But we must not mistake day to day changes for fundamental movements in the course of history . It very often requires greater courage and resolution to maintain a policy which time has tested , than to change it in the face of the moment s pressures . Our foreign policy rests on very tested principles . First , since Korea , we have labored to build a military strength of unmatched might . We have succeeded . If the threat of war has lessened , it is largely because our opponents realize that attack would bring destruction . This effort has been costly . But the costs of weakness are far greater than the costs of strength , and the payment far more painful . That is why , in the last 3 years , your Government has strengthened the whole range of America s defenses . We have increased defense spending in these 3 years by approximately 6 billion a year over the last year of the Eisenhower administration , and this year we are spending approximately 8 billion more on defense than we were during that last year . Second , we have strongly resisted Communist efforts to extend their dominion and successfully resisted efforts to expand their power . We have taken the risks and we have used the power which this principle demanded . We have avoided purposeless provocation and we have avoided needless adventure . The Berlin airlift , the Korean war , the defense of Formosa , the Cuba crisis , the struggle in Viet Nam , prove our determination to resist aggression and prove our ability to adapt particular response to particular challenge . Third , we have worked for the revival of strength among our allies , initially , to oppose Communist encroachment on warweakened nations in the long run , because our own future rests on the vitality and the unity of the Western society to which we belong . Fourth , we have encouraged the independence and the progress of developing countries . We are safer and we are more comfortable in a world where all people can govern themselves in their own way , and where all nations have the inner strength to resist external domination . Fifth , we have pursued every hope of a lasting peace . from the Baruch plan , named after that noble resident of this city , to the test ban treaty , we have sought and we have welcomed agreements which decrease danger without decreasing security . In that pursuit , for 20 years we have been the leading power in the support of the United Nations . In that pursuit , this year as in every year we will work to reach agreement on measures to reduce armament and lessen the chance of war . Today we apply these same principles in a world that is much changed since 1945 . Europe seeks a new role for strength rather than contenting itself with protection for weakness . The unity of communism is being eroded by the insistent forces of nationalism and diverging interest . A whole new group of societies is painfully struggling toward the modern world . Our basic principles are adequate to this shifting world . But foreign policy is more than just a set of general principles . It is the changing application of those principles to specific dangers and to specific opportunities . It involves knowledge of strengths and awareness of limitations in each new situation . The presence of offensive missiles in Cuba was a fact . The presence of fallout in the atmosphere has been a fact . The presence of guerrillas in Viet Nam , at this hour , is a fact . Such facts cannot be dealt with simply by historical judgments or general precepts . They require concrete acts of courage , and wisdom , and often restraint . These qualities of endurance and innovation , these qualities of continuity and change are at work in at least six major areas of continuing concern to you . First , is our relationship with the Soviet Union , the center of our concern for peace . Communists , using force and intrigue , seek to bring about a Communist dominated world . Our convictions , our interests , our life as a nation , demand that we resolutely oppose , with all of our might , that effort to dominate the world . This , and this alone , is the cause of the cold war between us . For the United States has nothing to fear from peaceful competition . We welcome it and we will win it . It is our system which flourishes and grows stronger in a world free from the threat of war . And in such a competition all people , everywhere , will be the gainers . Today , as we meet here , there are new pressures , new realities , which make it permissible to hope that the pursuit of peace is in the interests of the Soviet Union as it is in ours . And our own restraint may be convincing the Soviet leaders of the reality that we , in America , seek neither war nor the destruction of the Soviet Union . Thus I am very hopeful that we can take important steps toward the day when , in the words of the Old Testament , nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war anymore . We must remember that peace will not come suddenly . It will not emerge dramatically from a single agreement or a single meeting . It will be advanced by concrete and limited accommodations , by the gradual growth of common interests , by the increased awareness of shifting dangers and alignments , and by the development of trust in a good faith based on a reasoned view of the world . Our own position is clear . We will discuss any problem , we will listen to any proposal , we will pursue any agreement , we will take any action which might lessen the chance of war without sacrificing the interests of our allies or our own ability to defend the alliance against attack . In other words , our guard is up , but our hand is out . I am taking two actions today which reflect both our desire to reduce tension and our unwillingness to risk weakness . I have ordered a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched uranium , to be carried out over a 4 year period . When added to previous reductions , this will mean an overall decrease in the production of plutonium by 20 percent , and of enriched uranium by 4 deg percent . By bringing production in line with need , and the chart shows now that our production is here , and our need is here , and our reduction today will bring it here , we think we will reduce tension while we maintain all the necessary power . We must not operate a WPnuclear project , just to provide employment when our needs have been met . And in reaching these decisions I have been in close consultation with Prime Minister Douglas Home . Simultaneously with my announcement now , Chairman Khrushchev is releasing a statement in Moscow , at 2 of the clock our time , in which he makes definite commitments to steps toward a more peaceful world . He agrees to discontinue the construction of two big new atomic reactors for the production of plutonium over the next several years , to reduce substantially the production of U235 for nuclear weapons , and to allocate more fissionable material for peaceful uses . This is not disarmament . This is not a declaration of peace . But it is a hopeful sign and it is a step forward which we welcome and which we can take in the hope that the world may yet , one day , live without the fear of war . At the same time , I have reaffirmed all the safeguards against weakening our nuclear strength which we adopted at the time of the test ban treaty . The second area of continuing effort is the development of Atlantic partnership with a stronger and a more unified Europe . Having begun this policy when peril was great , we will not now abandon it as success moves closer . We worked for a stronger and more prosperous Europe , and Europe is strong and prosperous today because of our work and beyond our expectation . We have supported a close partnership with a more unified Europe and in the past 15 years more peaceful steps have been taken in this direction than have been taken at any time in our history . The pursuit of this goal , like the pursuit of any large and worthy cause , will not be easy or will not be untroubled . But the realities of the modern world teach that increased greatness and prosperity demand increased unity and partnership . The underlying forces of European life are eroding old barriers and they are dissolving old suspicions . Common institutions are expanding common interests . National boundaries continue to fade under the impact of travel and commerce and communication . A new generation is coming of age , unscarred by old hostilities or old ambitions , thinking of themselves as Europeans , their values shaped by a common Western culture . These forces and the steadfast effort of all who share common goals will shape the future . And unity based on hope will ultimately prove stronger than unity based on fear . We realize that sharing the burden of leadership requires us to share the responsibilities of power . As a step in this direction we support the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force composed of those nations which desire to participate . We also welcome agreed new mechanisms for political consultation on mutual interests throughout the world with whatever changes in organization are necessary to make such consultation rapid and effective . The experience of two world wars have taught us that the fundamental security interests of the United States and of Europe are the same . What we learned in time of war , we must not now forget in time of peace . for more than a decade we have sought to enlarge the independence and ease the rigors of the people of Eastern Europe . We have used the tools of peaceful exchange in goods , in persons , and in ideas to open up communication with these restless nations that Khrushchev refers to , sometimes , as children who have grown up too big to spank . We have used limited direct assistance where the needs of our security have allowed us to follow the demands of our compassion . In that spirit within the last month I have exercised the power granted the President by the Congress and I have reaffirmed the right of open trade with Poland and Yugoslavia . In the third area of continuing concern , Latin America , we have renewed our commitment to the Alliance for Progress , we have sought peaceful settlement of disputes among the American nations , and we have supported the OAS effort to isolate Communist controlled Cuba . The Alliance for Progress is the central task today of this hemisphere . That task is going ahead successfully . But that alliance means more than economic assistance or investment . It requires us to encourage and to support those democratic political forces which seek essential change within the framework of constitutional government . It means preference for rapid evolution as the only real alternative to violent revolution . To struggle to stand still in Latin America is just to throw the sand against the wind . We must , of course , always be on guard against Communist subversion . But anticommunism alone will never suffice to ensure our liberty or never suffice to fulfill our dreams . That is going to take leadership , leadership that is dedicated to economic progress without uneconomic privilege , to social change which enhances social justice , to political reform which widens human freedom . The resumption of relations with Panama proves once again the unmatched ability of our inter American system to resolve these disputes among our good neighbors . At the outset of that dispute with Panama , the first morning I stated to the President of Panama by telephone our willingness to seek a solution to all problems without conditions of any kind . And I told him that our negotiators would meet theirs anywhere , any time , to discuss anything , and we would do what was fair and just and right . We never departed from that willingness . And on that basis the dispute was settled . We now move toward solution with the generosity of friends who realize , as Woodrow Wilson once said , You cannot be friends on any other terms than upon the terms of equality . The use of Cuba as a base for subversion and terror is an obstacle to our hopes for the Western Hemisphere . Our first task must be , as it has been , to isolate Cuba from the inter American system , to frustrate its efforts to destroy free governments , and to expose the weakness of communism so that all can see . That policy is in effect and that policy is working . The problems of this hemisphere would be far more serious if Castro today sat at the councils of the Organization of American States disrupting debate and blocking decision , if Castro had open channels of trade and communication along which subversion and terror could flow , it his economy had been a successful model rather than a dismal warning to all of his neighbors . The effectiveness of our policy is more than a matter of trade statistics . It has increased awareness of difference and danger , it has revealed the brutal nature of the Cuban regime , it has lessened opportunities for subversion , it has reduced the number of Castro s followers , and it has drained the resources of our adversaries who are spending more than 1 million a day . We will continue this policy with every peaceful means at our command . A fourth area of continuity and change is the battle for freedom in the far East . In the last 20 years , in two wars , millions of Americans have fought to prevent the armed conquest of free Asia . Having invested so heavily in the past , we will not weaken in the present . The first American diplomatic mission to the far East was instructed to inform all countries that we will never make conquests , or ask any nation to let us establish ourselves in their countries . That was our policy in 1832 . That is our policy in 1964 . Our conquering forces left Asia after World War II with less territory under our flag than ever before . But if we have desired no conquest for ourselves , we have also steadfastly opposed it for others . The independence of Asian nations is a link in our own freedom . In Korea we proved the futility of direct aggression . In Viet Nam the Communists today try the more insidious , but the equally dangerous , methods of subversion , terror , and guerrilla warfare . They conduct a campaign organized , directed , supplied , and supported from Hanoi . This , too , we will prove futile . Armed Communist attack on Viet Nam is today a reality . The fighting spirit of South Viet Nam , as Secretary Rusk told us from there yesterday , is a reality . The request of a friend and an ally for our help in this terrible moment is a reality . The statement of the SEATO allies that Communist defeat is essential is a reality . To fail to respond to these realities would reflect on our honor as a nation , would undermine worldwide confidence in our courage , would convince every nation in South Asia that it must now bow to Communist terms to survive . The situation in Viet Nam is difficult . But there is an old American saying that when the going gets tough , the tough get going . So let no one doubt that we are in this battle as long as South Viet Nam wants our support and needs our assistance to protect its freedom . I have already ordered measures to step up the fighting capacity of the South Vietnamese forces , to help improve the welfare and the morale of their civilian population , to keep our forces at whatever level continued independence and freedom require . No negotiated settlement in Viet Nam is possible , as long as the Communists hope to achieve victory by force . Once war seems hopeless , then peace may be possible . The door is always open to any settlement which assures the independence of South Viet Nam , and its freedom to seek help for its protection . In Laos we continue to support the Geneva agreements which offer what we think is the best hope of peace and independence for that strife torn land . At my instruction yesterday Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy went to Laos , and he has already arrived there for a first hand examination of the developments , the developments that have come in the last 48 hours . At the moment we are encouraged by reports of progress toward the reestablishment of orderly , legal government . As for China itself , so long as the Communist Chinese pursue aggression , so long as the Communist Chinese preach violence , there can be and will be no easing of relationships . There are some who prophesy that these policies will change . But America must base her acts on present realities and not on future hopes . It is not we who must reexamine our view of China . It is the Chinese Communists who must reexamine their view of the world . Nor can anyone doubt our unalterable commitment to the defense and the liberty of free China . Meanwhile , we will say to our historic friends , the talented and courageous Chinese people on the mainland , that just as we opposed aggression against them , we must oppose aggression by their rulers and for the same reasons .

For a Texan , it is like homecoming , because much of the courage and the hard work that went into the building of the Southwest came from the hills and the fields of Tennessee . It strengthened the sinews of thousands of men at the Alamo , at San Jacinto , and at the homes of our pioneer people . This morning , I visited the Hermitage , the historic home of Andrew Jackson . Two centuries have passed since that most American of all Americans was born . The world has changed a great deal since his day . But the qualities which sustain men and nations in positions of leadership have not changed . In our time , as in Andrew Jackson s , freedom has its price . In our time , as in his , history conspires to test the American will . In our time , as in Jackson s time , courage and vision , and the willingness to sacrifice , will sustain the cause of freedom . This generation of Americans is making its imprint on history . It is making it in the fierce hills and the sweltering jungles of Vietnam . I think most of our citizens have after a very penetrating debate which is our democratic heritage reached a common understanding on the meaning and on the objectives of that struggle . Before I discuss the specific questions that remain at issue , I should like to review the points of widespread agreement . It was 2 years ago that we were forced to choose , forced to make a decision between major commitments in defense of South Vietnam or retreat the evacuation of more than 25 , 000 of our troops , the collapse of the Republic of Vietnam in the face of subversion and external assault . Andrew Jackson would never have been surprised at the choice we made . We chose a course in keeping with American tradition , in keeping with the foreign policy of at least three administrations , with the expressed will of the Congress of the United States , with our solemn obligations under the Southeast Asian Treaty , and with the interest of 16 million South Vietnamese who had no wish to live under Communist domination . As our commitment in Vietnam required more men and more equipment , some voices were raised in opposition . The administration was urged to disengage , to find an excuse to abandon the effort . These cries came despite growing evidence that the defense of Vietnam held the key to the political and economic future of free Asia . The stakes of the struggle grew correspondingly . It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the course in Vietnam , we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent Asia , full of promise and resolute in the cause of peaceful economic development for her long suffering peoples . But if we faltered , the forces of chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before us . The choice was clear . We would stay the course . And we shall stay the course . I think most Americans support this fundamental decision . Most of us remember the fearful cost of ignoring aggression . Most of us have cast aside the illusion that we can live in an affluent fortress while the world slides into chaos . I think we have all reached broad agreement on our basic objectives in Vietnam . First , an honorable peace , that will leave the people of South Vietnam free to fashion their own political and economic institutions without fear of terror or intimidation from the North . Second , a Southeast Asia in which all countries including a peaceful North Vietnam apply their scarce resources to the real problems of their people combating hunger , ignorance , and disease . I have said many , many times , that nothing would give us greater pleasure than to invest our own resources in the constructive works of peace rather than in the futile destruction of war . Third , a concrete demonstration that aggression across international frontiers or demarcation lines is no longer an acceptable means of political change . There is also , I think , a general agreement among Americans on the things that we do not want in Vietnam . We do not want permanent bases . We will begin with the withdrawal of our troops on a reasonable schedule whenever reciprocal concessions are forthcoming from our adversary . We do not seek to impose our political beliefs upon South Vietnam . Our Republic rests upon a brisk commerce in ideas . We will be happy to see free competition in the intellectual marketplace whenever North Vietnam is willing to shift the conflict from the battlefield to the ballot box . So , these are the broad principles on which most Americans agree . On a less general level , however , the events and frustrations of these past few difficult weeks have inspired a number of questions about our Vietnam policy in the minds and hearts of a good many of our citizens . Today , here in this historic chamber , I want to deal with some of those questions that figure most prominently in . the press and in some of the letters which reach a President s desk . Many Americans are confused by the barrage of information about military engagements . They long for the capsule summary which has kept tabs on our previous wars , a line on the map that divides friend from foe . Precisely what , they ask , is our military situation , and what are the prospects of victory The first answer is that Vietnam is aggression in a new guise , as far removed from trench warfare as the rifle from the longbow . This is a war of infiltration , of subversion , of ambush . Pitched battles are very rare , and even more rarely are they decisive . Today , more than 1 million men from the Republic of Vietnam and its six allies are engaged in the order of battle . Despite continuing increases in North Vietnam infiltration , this strengthening of allied forces in 1966 , under the brilliant leadership of General Westmoreland , was instrumental in reversing the whole course of this war . We estimate that 55 , 000 North Vietnamese and Vietcong were killed in 1966 , compared with 35 , 000 the previous year . Many more were wounded , and more than 20 , 000 defected . By contrast , 9 , 500 South Vietnamese , more than 5 , 000 Americans , and 600 from other allied forces were killed in action . The Vietnamese Army achieved a 1966 average of two weapons captured from the Vietcong to every one lost , a dramatic turn around from the previous 2 years . Allied forces have made several successful sweeps through territories that were formerly considered Vietcong sanctuaries only a short time ago . These operations not only cost the enemy large numbers of men and weapons , but are very damaging to his morale . Well , what does all of this mean Will the North Vietnamese change their tactics Will there be less infiltration of main units Will there be more of guerrilla warfare The actual truth is we just do not know . What we do know is that General Westmoreland s strategy is producing results , that our military situation has substantially improved , that our military success has permitted the groundwork to be laid for a pacification program which is the long run key to an independent South Vietnam . Since February 1965 , our military operations have included selective bombing of military targets in North Vietnam . Our purposes are three To back our fighting men by denying the enemy a sanctuary To exact a penalty against North Vietnam for her flagrant violations of the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 To limit the flow , or to substantially increase the cost of infiltration of men and material from North Vietnam . All of our intelligence confirms that we have been successful . Yet , some of our people object strongly to this aspect of our policy . Must we bomb , many people ask . Does it do any military good Is it consistent with America s limited objectives Is it an inhuman act that is aimed at civilians On the question of military utility , I can only report the firm belief of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the Central Intelligence Agency , General Westmoreland and our commanders in the field , and all the courses of information and advice available to the Commander in Chief and that is that the bombing is causing serious disruption and is bringing about added burdens to the North Vietnamese infiltration effort . We know , for example , that half a million people are kept busy just repairing damage to bridges , roads , railroads , and other strategic facilities , and in air and coastal defense and repair of powerplants . I also want to say categorically that it is not the position of the American Government that the bombing will be decisive in getting Hanoi to abandon aggression . It has , however , created very serious problems for them . The best indication of how substantial is the fact that they are working so hard every day with all their friends throughout the world to try to get us to stop . The bombing is entirely consistent with America s limited objectives in South Vietnam . The strength of Communist main force units in the South is clearly based on their infiltration from the North . So I think it is simply unfair to our American soldiers , sailors , and marines , and our Vietnamese allies to ask them to face increased enemy personnel and firepower without making an effort to try to reduce that infiltration . Now as to bombing civilians , I would simply say that we are making an effort that is unprecedented in the history of warfare to be sure that we do not . It is our policy to bomb military targets only . We have never deliberately bombed cities , nor attacked any target with the purpose of inflicting civilian casualties . We hasten to add , however , that we recognize , and we regret , that some people , even after warning , are living and working in the vicinity of military targets and they have suffered . We are also too aware that men and machines are not infallible and that some mistakes do occur . But our record on this account is , in my opinion , highly defensible . Look for a moment at the record of the other side . Any civilian casualties that result from our operations are inadvertent , in stark contrast to the calculated Vietcong policy of systematic terror . Tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese civilians have been killed , tortured , and kidnaped by the Vietcong . There is no doubt about the deliberate nature of the Vietcong program . One need only note the frequency with which Vietcong victims are village leaders , teachers , health workers , and others who are trying to carry out constructive programs for their people . Yet , the deeds of the Vietcong go largely unnoted in the public debate . It is this moral double bookkeeping which makes us get sometimes very weary of our critics . But there is another question that we should answer Why do not we stop bombing to make it easier to begin negotiations The answer is a simple one We stopped for 5 days and 20 hours in May 1965 . Representatives of Hanoi simply returned our message in a plain envelope . We stopped bombing for 36 days and 15 hot rs in December 1965 and January 1966 . Hanoi only replied A political settlement of the Vietnam problem can be envisaged only when the United States Government has accepted the four point stand of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , has proved this by actual deeds , has stopped unconditionally and for good its air raids and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . And only last month we stopped bombing for 5 days and 18 hours , after many prior weeks in which we had communicated to them several possible routes to peace , any one of which America was prepared to take . Their response , as you know , delivered to His Holiness the Pope , was this The United States must put an end to their aggression in Vietnam , end unconditionally and definitively the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , withdraw from South Vietnam all American and satellite troops , recognize the South Vietnamese National Front for Liberation , and let the Vietnamese people settle themselves their own affairs . That is where we stand today . They have three times rejected a bombing pause as a means to open the way to ending the war and going to the negotiating table . The tragedy of South Vietnam is not limited to casualty lists . There is much tragedy in the story of a nation at war for nearly a generation . It is the story of economic stagnation . It is the story of a generation of young men the flower of the labor force pressed into military service by one side or the other . No one denies that the survival of South Vietnam is heavily dependent upon early economic progress . My most recent and my most hopeful report of progress in this area came from an old friend of Tennessee , of the Tennessee Valley Authority David Lilienthal , who recently went as my representative to Vietnam to begin to work with the Vietnamese people on economic planning for that area . He reported and with some surprise , I might add that he discovered an extraordinary air of confidence among the farmers , and the village leaders , and the trade unionists , and the industrialists . He concluded that their economic behavior suggests and I quote him , that they think that they know how this is all going to come out . Lilienthal also said that the South Vietnamese were among the hardest working people that he had seen in developing countries around the world , that to have been through 20 years of war and still have this amount of zip almost ensures their long term economic development . Lilienthal will be going with me to Guam Saturday night to talk with our new leaders about the plans that he will try to institute there . Our AID programs are supporting the drive toward this sound economy . But none of these economic accomplishments will be decisive by itself . And no economic achievement can substitute for a strong and free political structure . We cannot build such a structure because only the Vietnamese can do that . And I think they are building it . As I am talking to you here , a freely elected Constituent Assembly in Saigon is now wrestling with the last details of a new constitution , one which will bring the Republic of Vietnam to full membership among the democratic nations of the world . We expect that constitution to be completed this month . In the midst of war , they have been building for peace and justice . That is a remarkable accomplishment in the annals of mankind . Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , who has served us with such great distinction , is coming to the end of his second distinguished tour of duty in Saigon . To replace him , I am drafting as our Ambassador to the Government of Vietnam , Ellsworth Bunker able and devoted , full of wisdom and experience acquired on five continents over many years . As his Deputy , I am nominating and recalling from Pakistan , Eugene Locke , our young and very vigorous Ambassador to Pakistan . To drive forward with a sense of urgency in our work in pacification , I am sending the President s Special Assistant , Robert Komer . To strengthen General Westmoreland in the intense operations that he will be conducting in the months ahead , I am assigning to him additional topflight military personnel , the best that this country has been able to produce . So you can be confident that in the months ahead we shall have at work in Saigon the ablest , the wisest , the most tenacious , and the most experienced team that the United States of America can mount . In view of these decisions and in view of the meetings that will take place this weekend , I thought it wise to invite the leaders of South Vietnam to join us in Guam for a part of our discussions , if it were convenient for them . I am gratified to be informed that they have accepted our invitation . I should also like for you to know that the representatives of all the countries that are contributing troops in Vietnam will be coming to Washington for April 20 and 21 meetings for a general appraisal of the situation that exists . Now this brings me to my final point , the peaceful and just world that we all seek . We have just lived through another flurry of rumors of peace feelers . Our years of dealing with this problem have taught us that peace will not come easily . The problem is a very simple one It takes two to negotiate at a peace table and Hanoi has just simply refused to consider coming to a peace table . I do not believe that our own position on peace negotiations can be stated any more clearly than I have stated it many times in the past or than the distinguished Secretary of State , Rusk , or Ambassador Goldberg , or any number of other officials have stated it in every forum that we could find . I do want to repeat to you this afternoon and through you to the people of America the essentials now , lest there be any doubts . United States representatives are ready at any time for discussions of the Vietnam problem or any related matter , with any government or governments , if there is any reason to believe that these discussions will in any way seriously advance the cause of peace . We are prepared to go more than halfway and to use any avenue possible to encourage such discussions . And we have done that at every opportunity . We believe that the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 could serve as the central elements of a peaceful settlement . These accords provide , in essence , that both South and North Vietnam should be free from external interference , while at the same time they would be free independently to determine their positions on the question of reunification . We also stand ready to advance toward a reduction of hostilities , without prior agreement . The road to peace could go from deeds to discussions , or it could start with discussions and go to deeds . We are ready to take either route . We are ready to move on both of them . But reciprocity must be the fundamental principle of any reduction in hostilities . The United States cannot and will not reduce its activities unless and until there is some reduction on the other side . To follow any other rule would be to violate the trust that we undertake when we ask a man to risk his life for his country . We will negotiate a reduction of the bombing whenever the Government of North Vietnam is ready and there are almost innumerable avenues of communication by which the Government of North Vietnam can make their readiness known . To this date and this hour , there has been no sign of that readiness . Yet , we must and we will keep on trying . As I speak to you today , Secretary Rusk and our representatives throughout the world are on a constant alert . Hundreds and hundreds of quiet diplomatic conversations , free from the glare of front page headlines , or of klieg lights , are being held and they will be held on the possibilities of bringing peace to Vietnam . Governor Averell Harriman , with 25 years of experience of troubleshooting on the most difficult international problems that America has ever had , is carrying out my instructions that every possible lead , however slight it may first appear , from any source , public or private , shall be followed up . Let me conclude by saying this I so much wish that it were within my power to assure that all those in Hanoi could hear one simple message America is committed to the defense of South Vietnam until an honorable peace can be negotiated . If this one communication gets through and its rational implications are drawn , we should be at the table tomorrow . It would be none too soon for us . Then hundreds of thousands of Americans as brave as any who ever took the field for their country could come back home . And the man who could lead them back is the man that you trained and sent from here , our own beloved , brilliant General Westy Westmoreland . As these heroes came back to their homes , millions of Vietnamese could begin to make a decent life for themselves and their families without fear of terrorism , without fear of war , or without fear of Communist enslavement . That is what we are working and what we are fighting for . We must not we shall not and we will not fail . Thank you .<speech_sep>President Hatcher , Governor Romney , Senators McNamara and Hart , Congressmen Meader and Staebler , and other members of the fine Michigan delegation , members of the graduating class , my fellow Americans It is a great pleasure to be here today . This university has been coeducational since 1870 , but I do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a Detroit high school girl said , In choosing a college , you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school . Well , we can find both here at Michigan , although perhaps at different hours . I came out here today very anxious to meet the Michigan student whose father told a friend of mine that his son s education had been a real value . It stopped his mother from bragging about him . I have come today from the turmoil of your Capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country . The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people . Our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation . For a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent . For half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people . The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life , and to advance the quality of our American civilization . Your imagination , your initiative , and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant of our needs , or a society where old values and new visions are buried under unbridled growth . For in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society , but upward to the Great Society . The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all . It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice , to which we are totally committed in our time . But that is just the beginning . The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents . It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect , not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness . It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community . It is a place where man can renew contact with nature . It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race . It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods . But most of all , the Great Society is not a safe harbor , a resting place , a final objective , a finished work . It is a challenge constantly renewed , beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor . So I want to talk to you today about three places where we begin to build the Great Society in our cities , in our countryside , and in our classrooms . Many of you will live to see the day , perhaps 50 years from now , when there will be 400 million Americans four fifths of them in urban areas . In the remainder of this century urban population will double , city land will double , and we will have to build homes , highways , and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled . So in the next 40 years we must rebuild the entire urban United States . Aristotle said Men come together in cities in order to live , but they remain together in order to live the good life . It is harder and harder to live the good life in American cities today . The catalog of ills is long there is the decay of the centers and the despoiling of the suburbs . There is not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic . Open land is vanishing and old landmarks are violated . Worst of all expansion is eroding the precious and time honored values of community with neighbors and communion with nature . The loss of these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference . Our society will never be great until our cities are great . Today the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders . New experiments are already going on . It will be the task of your generation to make the American city a place where future generations will come , not only to live but to live the good life . I understand that if I stayed here tonight I would see that Michigan students are really doing their best to live the good life . This is the place where the Peace Corps was started . It is inspiring to see how all of you , while you are in this country , are trying so hard to live at the level of the people . A second place where we begin to build the Great Society is in our countryside . We have always prided ourselves on being not only America the strong and America the free , but America the beautiful . Today that beauty is in danger . The water we drink , the food we eat , the very air that we breathe , are threatened with pollution . Our parks are overcrowded , our seashores overburdened . Green fields and dense forests are disappearing . A few years ago we were greatly concerned about the Ugly American . Today we must act to prevent an ugly America . For once the battle is lost , once our natural splendor is destroyed , it can never be recaptured . And once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be wasted . A third place to build the Great Society is in the classrooms of America . There your children s lives will be shaped . Our society will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan the farthest reaches of thought and imagination . We are still far from that goal . Today , 8 million adult Americans , more than the entire population of Michigan , have not finished 5 years of school . Nearly 20 million have not finished 8 years of school . Nearly 54 million more than one quarter of all America have not even finished high school . Each year more than 100 , 000 high school graduates , with proved ability , do not enter college because they cannot afford it . And if we cannot educate today s youth , what will we do in 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million greater than 1960 And high school enrollment will rise by 5 million . College enrollment will increase by more than 3 million . In many places , classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated . Most of our qualified teachers are underpaid , and many of our paid teachers are unqualified . So we must give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from . Poverty must not be a bar to learning , and learning must offer an escape from poverty . But more classrooms and more teachers are not enough . We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size . This means better training for our teachers . It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor . It means exploring new techniques of teaching , to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation . These are three of the central issues of the Great Society . While our Government has many programs directed at those issues , I do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problems . But I do promise this We are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest knowledge from all over the world to find those answers for America . I intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of White House conferences and meetings on the cities , on natural beauty , on the quality of education , and on other emerging challenges . And from these meetings and from this inspiration and from these studies we will begin to set our course toward the Great Society . The solution to these problems does not rest on a massive program in Washington , nor can it rely solely on the strained resources of local authority . They require us to create new concepts of cooperation , a creative federalism , between the National Capital and the leaders of local communities . Woodrow Wilson once wrote Every man sent out from his university should be a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time . Within your lifetime powerful forces , already loosed , will take us toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience , almost beyond the bounds of our imagination . For better or for worse , your generation has been appointed by history to deal with those problems and to lead America toward a new age . You have the chance never before afforded to any people in any age . You can help build a society where the demands of morality , and the needs of the spirit , can be realized in the life of the Nation . So , will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which God enjoins and the law requires , whatever his belief , or race , or the color of his skin Will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty Will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations to live in enduring peace as neighbors and not as mortal enemies Will you join in the battle to build the Great Society , to prove that our material progress is only the foundation on which we will build a richer life of mind and spirit There are those timid souls who say this battle cannot be won that we are condemned to a soulless wealth . I do not agree . We have the power to shape the civilization that we want . But we need your will , your labor , your hearts , if we are to build that kind of society . Those who came to this land sought to build more than just a new country . They sought a new world . So I have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision our reality . So let us from this moment begin our work so that in the future men will look back and say It was then , after a long and weary way , that man turned the exploits of his genius to the full enrichment of his life . Thank you . Goodby .<speech_sep>This past week the United States has demonstrated anew in at least eight different situations this Nation s determination to insure both peace and freedom in the widest possible areas . Progress toward these ends is frequently slow and rarely dramatic , but it should be viewed in the perspective of history and not headlines . First , we have been patiently continuing our efforts to resume relations with our neighbors in Panama , and to reconsider with them , without preconditions on either side , all issues which threaten to divide us . Second , we have been quietly working on the Cyprus crisis with our friends , to determine the most useful role that each of us can play in easing the present strains on the island . Third , in response to my request , I have received assurances from the new and friendly leaders of Viet Nam that they are proceeding immediately to step up the pace of military operations against the Viet Cong , with specific instructions to the corps commanders and a personal visit by General Khanh to the vital delta area . Fourth , we have been consulting with all parties concerned in the Indonesian Malaysian dispute , including the United Nations , to follow up on the Attorney General s successful efforts in arranging for a cease fire and a discussion at the conference table . Fifth , we have been in constant consultation with our allies regarding the troubled course of independence in several East African states where we can hardly expect to control events , but we can help these nations preserve their freedom from foreign domination . Sixth , we have been confronted with the brutal shooting down of an unarmed American plane off course in East Germany , and the necessity for preventing further incidents of this kind . Seventh , in view of the french recognition of Red China , we have been discussing with the free nations of Asia the necessity of resisting any further temptations to reward the Peking regime for its defiance of world peace and order . And finally , we have witnessed and the whole world has witnessed with pleasure the remarkable success of our Saturn rocket , the most powerful rocket thrust known to man . This rocket , I am happy to say , was first recommended by our committee in 1958 . It is not our desire or in our interest to create an air of emergency about these or other events . Our work proceeds both day and night , quietly , steadily , I believe confidently , and I think the American people have every reason to share in that confidence . I have a few announcements to make in the defense area . first , I am gratified by the results from the letters to defense contractors 1 that I sent out less than a month ago . We have received almost 800 replies to that letter . The Defense Department has talked with many businessmen directly . This is going to be an important part of the effort which we believe is going to produce savings to the taxpayers of over 4 billion per year in fiscal 1967 . The savings to be effected by the Department of Defense , the White House announced on January 27 , would be the result of a vigorous program to shift from contracting on a cost plus fixed fee basis to fixed price or incentive contracts , and of reducing the number of letter contracts , preliminary agreements under which contractors may start work before a price is agreed on . Second , I want to draw your attention today to the cost reduction section of the Defense Department budget statement which was released last week . Some figures in there should be of interest to every taxpayer . Next year s Defense budget , the one just sent up for fiscal 1965 , includes , due to more efficient management of our defenses , 2 4 10 billion . That is more than 10 for every man , woman , and child in our country . That has come about because of more efficient management under McNamara and the men who serve with him . That is money that is strictly saved in the coming fiscal year simply by following more sensible and efficient procedures . It is money saved not by risking this country s security , not by cutting our defenses , but by running the Department on a sound and businesslike basis , and with real unification . I have seen more unification present and achieved in the Defense Department than at any time since the Department was created . We are , in fact , constantly making improvements in our strategic missile arsenal . We are improving the payloads , the accuracies , the reliability of all of these weapons . We are also adding new weapons to our arsenal . We are now completing development , for example , on three new and highly advanced weapons systems . I think you would like to hear something about this , because you can take great pride in it . first , the first of these is the Redeye . for the first time our ground combat soldier will be able to fight back against a high performance enemy aircraft . The Redeye , which he can fire from the shoulder like a rifle , sends a heat seeking missile in pursuit of the enemy airplane , with a very high probability of scoring . Once hit , the airplane will go down . Redeye has been developed by the Pomona Division of General Dynamics at Pomona , Calif . Second , the Shillelagh has successfully completed engineering tests and is being released for production . It is an antitank missile mounted on a vehicle so light that we can parachute it into the battlefield , and so accurate that it can destroy a tank at a range of several thousand yards . And finally , the Navy has recently demonstrated the Walleye , a glide bomb to be launched from an airplane and guided to its target by television . The bomb has a television camera which is focused through remote control by the pilot in the airplane . Once the pilot has focused the camera on the target , the mechanism in the bomb takes over , watches the television screen inside the bomb , and then guides it until it reaches the target . The Walleye has been demonstrated and it has shown amazing accuracy at a range of several miles . It is being developed by the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake , Calif . , where the now famous Sidewinder missile was developed . Finally , I conferred at length yesterday with Sargent Shriver , who has just returned from a world trip , and I have asked him to serve as Special Assistant to the President in the organization and the ado ministration of the war on poverty program which I announced in my State of the Union Message . Shriver will continue to serve as Director of the Peace Corps . He will begin immediately to study the formulation and the execution of the concentrated assault on the causes and cures of poverty in the United States . I expect to appoint a committee of the Cabinet to serve in an advisory capacity with him , a Cabinet committee to be made up of the Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare , the Secretary of Labor , the Attorney General , the various departments , that would be Interior and Agriculture , that would be concerned with our war on poverty . Shriver is eminently qualified for this additional assignment . As you know , he is Executive Director of the Joseph Kennedy foundation , he was President of the Chicago School Board , he is a very successful businessman . He is an organizer and Director of the Peace Corps . He has demonstrated outstanding qualities of leadership , and I am sure that we will find that in the organization and draft of the message as well as the administration of the poverty program , if it is approved by Congress , we will find him an exceptionally well qualified employee . Now I would like to conclude by reading a brief message that I have just sent to General Khanh in Viet Nam , in which I say I am glad to know that we see eye to eye on the necessity of stepping up the pace of military operations against the Viet Cong . I particularly appreciate your warm and immediate response to my message as conveyed by Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins . We shall continue to be available to help you to carry the war to the enemy , and to increase the confidence of the Vietnamese people in their government . A couple of days ago I sent General Khanh a message urging him to step up the pace of military operations . He immediately replied , as I announced in my more formal statement , and this is my personal , longhand reply to the General . Now , any questions No , I do not . The Senate committee is now making a study of the accuracy of some of the allegations that you have made . They will , in their wisdom , determine the accuracy of those allegations and , I am sure , render proper judgment . I do not have an answer to that question of yours . I thought that this would be ample to take care of your needs . I am sorry if you find yourselves uncomfortable . It was much more convenient to come here at the time that I could come , and I was attempting to satisfy the newsmen . It is somewhat difficult to do sometimes , but they wanted a news conference this week , and I thought this was the appropriate place and could be best handled here . No , I do not have any favorite opponent . It is not my duty to select my opposition . I think that the delegates to the Republican Convention will act wisely and select the best man that is available to them . And so far as I am concerned , I hope to keep as free from politics as I can , as long as I can , because I think it is in the interest of the continuity and transition of this administration and the unity of the country to keep free from mudslinging and petty politics and getting into any political battles . I have asked the Democrats to refrain from indulging in any personalities if at all possible . We will have debates about principles and we expect differences of opinion . We do not want to suppress them or silence them . But I found in the 8 years that I served as Democratic Leader under President Eisenhower that it was not necessary to sling mud or to indulge in personalities , and I hope that our Democratic people will follow that course . What the Republicans do is a matter for them to determine in their wisdom . If we could have neutralization of both North Viet Nam and South Viet Nam , I am sure that would be considered sympathetically . But I see no indication of that at the moment . I think that if we could expect the Viet Cong to let their neighbors live in peace , we could take a much different attitude . But as long as these raids are continuing and people are attempting to envelop South Viet Nam , I think that the present course we are conducting is the only answer to that course , and I think that the operations should be stepped up there . I see no sentiment favoring neutralization of South Viet Nam alone , and I think the course that we are following is the most advisable one for freedom at this point . I would think that it would be premature and somewhat presumptuous at this point for me to go into any detailed discussion on the selection of a Vice President . I think that if I am nominated by the convention , selected as their standard bearer , my recommendations will likely be sought , and if so , I will be glad to give them . And at that time I will cross that bridge . I hope that I can act wisely and in the best interests of the American people . No . I feel that I have not gone into the details of the fight . I am aware of the issue . I concur in the judgment that Secretary McNamara has made . I think that we are looking far into the future and that those judgments are always susceptible to error . But at this moment I would conclude that his decision has been a reasonable one and a fair one and one in which I agree . The answer to your first question is that I think that in the 60 days that I have held this office we have made great progress in legislation . When I came into it , we had gone along down the road with our educational bills , but we finally consummated them , and I think we have the best educational Congress in the history of the Republic . We had 5 or 6 appropriations bills out of 15 passed . We concluded action on those during this period of time . We have reported the civil rights bill from the Rules Committee , and it is now being debated in the House . I hope and I believe that it will be passed without any crippling amendments . I think it should be passed without any crippling amendments . I think that due progress is being made there . I hope it is acted upon in the House before the Members leave to attend Lincoln Day birthday meetings throughout the Nation , because it would be a great tribute to President Lincoln to have that bill finally acted upon in the House before we go out to celebrate his birthday . On the tax bill , it has been before the Congress now for almost 13 months . The Senate has reported it , the Senate committee has reported it to the Senate . It is being debated there . There are some 180 odd technical amendments and there will be dozens of other amendments . It will be carefully deliberated , but I hope that we can pass it before we take a recess for Lincoln s Birthday on February 12 . I am pleased with the progress made on both of those bills . I hope the tax bill can withstand the onslaughts that will be made by many in attempting to amend it in the next few days , and then will go to conference . And I would like to see it reported from conference as nearly to the administration s recommendations as possible , because before those recommendations were submitted to Congress , I participated in their formulation and embraced them . Now , there are other important items . We have a good many items in the national resource legislation field , like the wilderness bill and others . We have a good many measures we must pass in the agricultural field , farm legislation , which we consider very important . We consider medical care a very important measure , and I have already talked to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee about it . I have talked to leading Republicans who have a substitute plan that they have proposed , which I am now studying and giving some thought to , trying to determine the merits of it . But I hope that we can pass a medicare bill out of the House Ways and Means Committee and through the Congress this year based on the social security principle . I can think of no single piece of legislation that I would be happier to approve than that bill . The housing legislation I could spend most of this time telling you how important I think it is . It is one of the most comprehensive bills in the history of the Nation . I hope that we can work toward the goal of someday every American owning his home . I think that this message goes in that direction . I have reviewed it carefully , both at the ranch and here in Washington , with Administrator Weaver . We will start hearings on it very shortly in both bodies . It is extremely important . I think that we have an administration program that is going to be difficult to enact before the conventions , but with cooperation from all people on both sides of the aisle I hope we will attain a major part of it . To your second question , I would say that I do put medical care high on the priority list . Yes . I do not agree with General de Gaulle s proposals . I do not think that it would be in the interest of freedom to share his view . General de Gaulle is entitled to his opinion . He has expressed it . We have expressed ours . We think the course of action that we are following in Southeast Asia is the only course for us to follow , and the most advisable at this time . We plan to pursue it diligently and , we hope , successfully on a stepped up basis . I would rather not express it in terms of optimism or pessimism . I would rather say that it should be the goal of every leader in the world today to try to find areas of agreement that will lead to disarmament . We are seriously , dedicatedly , doing our very best and trying to initiate and develop every conceivable fresh proposal we can that will lead to that end . No , I do not think it will have to be substantially trimmed . And yes , I do expect a filibuster . I supported that platform and embraced that platform , and stated that view in 43 States in the Union . I realize there has been discrimination in the employment of women , and I am doing my best to do something about it . I am hopeful that in the next month we will have made substantial advances in that field . The general question was raised with me at my last meeting . I spoke with candor and frankness on that subject , about all I knew about it . I said then that I did not plan to make any more statements on it , and I do not . Well , you will have to ask General de Gaulle about the details of his proposal . But as I understand it , the neutralization talk has applied only to South Viet Nam and not to the whole of that area of the world . I think that the only thing we need to do to have complete peace in that area of the world now is to stop the invasion of South Viet Nam by some of its neighbors and supporters . On all three of them . And I am unaware of any differences among my advisers in that field . We have a group from the Cabinet that has given considerable attention to that and we are now developing recommendations . Those recommendations will be contained in a message . But my answer to your question is , first , I know of no disagreement among my advisers two , I think the message will emphasize all three areas . That message is being very carefully worked out and will be coordinated with all of the advisers who have responsibilities in those fields . We expect to get through the regular appropriations bills in excess of a half billion dollars to be coordinated into the poverty program so that it will be essential that we have the cooperation of all the Cabinet departments to whom the money is appropriated . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Good evening , my fellow Americans Tonight I want to speak to you of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia . No other question so preoccupies our people . No other dream so absorbs the 250 million human beings who live in that part of the world . No other goal motivates American policy in Southeast Asia . For years , representatives of our Government and others have traveled the world seeking to find a basis for peace talks . Since last September , they have carried the offer that I made public at San Antonio . That offer was this That the United States would stop its bombardment of North Vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussions and that we would assume that North Vietnam would not take military advantage of our restraint . Hanoi denounced this offer , both privately and publicly . Even while the search for peace was going on , North Vietnam rushed their preparations for a savage assault on the people , the government , and the allies of South Vietnam . Their attack during the Tet holidays failed to achieve its principal objectives . It did not collapse the elected government of South Vietnam or shatter its army as the Communists had hoped . It did not produce a general uprising among the people of the cities as they had predicted . The Communists were unable to maintain control of any of the more than 30 cities that they attacked . And they took very heavy casualties . But they did compel the South Vietnamese and their allies to move certain forces from the countryside into the cities . They caused widespread disruption and suffering . Their attacks , and the battles that followed , made refugees of half a million human beings . The Communists may renew their attack any day . They are , it appears , trying to make 1968 the year of decision in South Vietnam the year that brings , if not final victory or defeat , at least a turning point in the struggle . This much is clear If they do mount another round of heavy attacks , they will not succeed in destroying the fighting power of South Vietnam and its allies . But tragically , this is also clear Many men on both sides of the struggle will be lost . A nation that has already suffered 20 years of warfare will suffer once again . Armies on both sides will take new casualties . And the war will go on . There is no need for this to be so . There is no need to delay the talks that could bring an end to this long and this bloody war . Tonight , I renew the offer I made last August to stop the bombardment of North Vietnam . We ask that talks begin promptly , that they be serious talks on the substance of peace . We assume that during those talks Hanoi will not take advantage of our restraint . We are prepared to move immediately toward peace through negotiations . So , tonight , in the hope that this action will lead to early talks , I am taking the first step to deescalate the conflict . We are reducing substantially reducing the present level of hostilities . And we are doing so unilaterally , and at once . Tonight , I have ordered our aircraft and our naval vessels to make no attacks on North Vietnam , except in the area north of the demilitarized zone where the continuing enemy buildup directly threatens allied forward positions and where the movements of their troops and supplies are clearly related to that threat . The area in which we are stopping our attacks includes almost 90 percent of North Vietnam s population , and most of its territory . Thus there will be no attacks around the principal populated areas , or in the food producing areas of North Vietnam . Even this very limited bombing of the North could come to an early end if our restraint is matched by restraint in Hanoi . But I cannot in good conscience stop all bombing so long as to do so would immediately and directly endanger the lives of our men and our allies . Whether a complete bombing halt becomes possible in the future will be determined by events . Our purpose in this action is to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exists . It is to save the lives of brave men and to save the lives of innocent women and children . It is to permit the contending forces to move closer to a political settlement . And tonight , I call upon the United Kingdom and I call upon the Soviet Union as cochairmen of the Geneva Conferences , and as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to do all they can to move from the unilateral act of deescalation that I have just announced toward genuine peace in Southeast Asia . Now , as in the past , the United States is ready to send its representatives to any forum , at any time , to discuss the means of bringing this ugly war to an end . I am designating one of our most distinguished Americans , Ambassador Averell Harriman , as my personal representative for such talks . In addition , I have asked Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson , who returned from Moscow for consultation , to be available to join Ambassador Harriman at Geneva or any other suitable place just as soon as Hanoi agrees to a conference . I call upon President Ho Chi Minh to respond positively , and favorably , to this new step toward peace . But if peace does not come now through negotiations , it will come when Hanoi understands that our common resolve is unshakable , and our common strength is invincible . Tonight , we and the other allied nations are contributing 600 , 000 fighting men to assist 700 , 000 South Vietnamese troops in defending their little country . Our presence there has always rested on this basic belief The main burden of preserving their freedom must be carried out by them by the South Vietnamese themselves . We and our allies can only help to provide a shield behind which the people of South Vietnam can survive and can grow and develop . On their efforts on their determination and resourcefulness the outcome will ultimately depend . That small , beleaguered nation has suffered terrible punishment for more than 20 years . I pay tribute once again tonight to the great courage and endurance of its people . South Vietnam supports armed forces tonight of almost 700 , 000 men and I call your attention to the fact that this is the equivalent of more than 10 million in our own population . Its people maintain their firm determination to be free of domination by the North . There has been substantial progress , I think , in building a durable government during these last 3 years . The South Vietnam of 1965 could not have survived the enemy s Tet offensive of 1968 . The elected government of South Vietnam survived that attack and is rapidly repairing the devastation that it wrought . The South Vietnamese know that further efforts are going to be required to expand their own armed forces , to move back into the countryside as quickly as possible , to increase their taxes , to select the very best men that they have for civil and military responsibility , to achieve a new unity within their constitutional government , and to include in the national effort all those groups who wish to preserve South . Vietnam s control over its own destiny . Last week President Thieu ordered the mobilization of 135 , 000 additional South Vietnamese . He plans to reach as soon as possible a total military strength of more than 800 , 000 men . To achieve this , the Government of South Vietnam started the drafting of 19 year olds on March 1st . On May 1st , the Government will begin the drafting of 18 year olds . Last month , 10 , 000 men volunteered for military service that was two and a half times the number of volunteers during the same month last year . Since the middle of January , more than 48 , 000 South Vietnamese have joined the armed forces and nearly half of them volunteered to do so . All men in the South Vietnamese armed forces have had their tours of duty extended for the duration of the war , and reserves are now being called up for immediate active duty . President Thieu told his people last week We must make greater efforts and accept more sacrifices because , as I have said many times , this is our country . The existence of our nation is at stake , and this is mainly a Vietnamese responsibility . He warned his people that a major national effort is required to root out corruption and incompetence at all levels of government . We applaud this evidence of determination on the part of South Vietnam . Our first priority will be to support their effort . We shall accelerate the reequipment of South Vietnam s armed forces in order to meet the enemy s increased firepower . This will enable them progressively to undertake a larger share of combat operations against the Communist invaders . On many occasions I have told the American people that we would send to Vietnam those forces that are required to accomplish our mission there . So , with that as our guide , we have previously authorized a force level of approximately 525 , 000 . Some weeks ago to help meet the enemy s new offensive we sent to Vietnam about 11 , 000 additional Marine and airborne troops . They were deployed by air in 48 hours , on an emergency basis . But the artillery , tank , aircraft , medical , and other units that were needed to work with and to support these infantry troops in combat could not then accompany them by air on that short notice . In order that these forces may reach maximum combat effectiveness , the Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended to me that we should prepare to send during the next 5 months support troops totaling approximately 13 , 500 men . A portion of these men will be made available from our active forces . The balance will come from reserve component units which will be called up for service . The actions that we have taken since the beginning of the year to reequip the South Vietnamese forces , to meet our responsibilities in Korea , as well as our responsibilities in Vietnam , to meet price increases and the cost of activating and deploying reserve forces , to replace helicopters and provide the other military supplies we need , all of these actions are going to require additional expenditures . The tentative estimate of those additional expenditures is 2 . 5 billion in this fiscal year , and 2 . 6 billion in the next fiscal year . These projected increases in expenditures for our national security will bring into sharper focus the Nation s need for immediate action action to protect the prosperity of the American people and to protect the strength and the stability of our American dollar . On many occasions I have pointed out that , without a tax bill or decreased expenditures , next year s deficit would again be around 20 billion . I have emphasized the need to set strict priorities in our spending . I have stressed that failure to act and to act promptly and decisively would raise very strong doubts throughout the world about America s willingness to keep its financial house in order . Yet Congress has not acted . And tonight we face the sharpest financial threat in the postwar era a threat to the dollar s role as the keystone of international trade and finance in the world . Last week , at the monetary conference in Stockholm , the major industrial countries decided to take a big step toward creating a new international monetary asset that will strengthen the international monetary system . I am very proud of the very able work done by Secretary Fowler and Chairman Martin of the Federal Reserve Board . But to make this system work the United States just must bring its balance of payments to or very close to equilibrium . We must have a responsible fiscal policy in this country . The passage of a tax bill now , together with expenditure control that the Congress may desire and dictate , is absolutely necessary to protect this Nation s security , to continue our prosperity , and to meet the needs of our people . What is at stake is 7 years of unparalleled prosperity . In those 7 years , the real income of the average American , after taxes , rose by almost 30 percent a gain as large as that of the entire preceding 19 years . So the steps that we must take to convince the world are exactly the steps we must take to sustain our own economic strength here at home . In the past 8 months , prices and interest rates have risen because of our inaction . We must , therefore , now do everything we can to move from debate to action from talking to voting . There is , I believe I hope there is in both Houses of the Congress a growing sense of urgency that this situation just must be acted upon and must be corrected . My budget in January was , we thought , a tight one . It fully reflected our evaluation of most of the demanding needs of this Nation . But in these budgetary matters , the President does not decide alone . The Congress has the power and the duty to determine appropriations and taxes . The Congress is now considering our proposals and they are considering reductions in the budget that we submitted . As part of a program of fiscal restraint that includes the tax surcharge , I shall approve appropriate reductions in the January budget when and if Congress so decides that that should be done . One thing is unmistakably clear , however Our deficit just must be reduced . Failure to act could bring on conditions that would strike hardest at those people that all of us are trying so hard to help . These times call for prudence in this land of plenty . I believe that we have the character to provide it , and tonight I plead with the Congress and with the people to act promptly to serve the national interest , and thereby serve all of our people . Now let me give you my estimate of the chances for peace the peace that will one day stop the bloodshed in South Vietnam , that will permit all the Vietnamese people to rebuild and develop their land , that will permit us to turn more fully to our own tasks here at home . I cannot promise that the initiative that I have announced tonight will be completely successful in achieving peace any more than the 30 others that we have undertaken and agreed to in recent years . But it is our fervent hope that North Vietnam , after years of fighting that have left the issue unresolved , will now cease its efforts to achieve a military victory and will join with us in moving toward the peace table . And there may come a time when South Vietnamese on both sides are able to work out a way to settle their own differences by free political choice rather than by war . As Hanoi considers its course , it should be in no doubt of our intentions . It must not miscalculate the pressures within our democracy in this election year . We have no intention of widening this war . But the United States will never accept a fake solution to this long and arduous struggle and call it peace . No one can foretell the precise terms of an eventual settlement . Our objective in South Vietnam has never been the annihilation of the enemy . It has been to bring about a recognition in Hanoi that its objective taking over the South by force could not be achieved . We think that peace can be based on the Geneva Accords of 1954 under political conditions that permit the South Vietnamese all the South Vietnamese to chart their course free of any outside domination or interference , from us or from anyone else . So tonight I reaffirm the pledge that we made at Manila that we are prepared to withdraw our forces from South Vietnam as the other side withdraws its forces to the north , stops the infiltration , and the level of violence thus subsides . Our goal of peace and self determination in Vietnam is directly related to the future of all of Southeast Asia where much has happened to inspire confidence during the past 10 years . We have done all that we knew how to do to contribute and to help build that confidence . A number of its nations have shown what can be accomplished under conditions of security . Since 1966 , Indonesia , the fifth largest nation in all the world , with a population of more than 100 million people , has had a government that is dedicated to peace with its neighbors and improved conditions for its own people . Political and economic cooperation between nations has grown rapidly . I think every American can take a great deal of pride in the role that we have played in bringing this about in Southeast Asia . We can rightly judge as responsible Southeast Asians themselves do that the progress of the past 3 years would have been far less likely if not completely impossible if America s sons and others had not made their stand in Vietnam . At Johns Hopkins University , about 3 years ago , I announced that the United States would take part in the great work of developing Southeast Asia , including the Mekong Valley , for all the people of that region . Our determination to help build a better land a better land for men on both sides of the present conflict has not diminished in the least . Indeed , the ravages of war , I think , have made it more urgent than ever . So , I repeat on behalf of the United States again tonight what I said at Johns Hopkins that North Vietnam could take its place in this common effort just as soon as peace comes . Over time , a wider framework of peace and security in Southeast Asia may become possible . The new cooperation of the nations of the area could be a foundation stone . Certainly friendship with the nations of such a Southeast Asia is what the United States seeks and that is all that the United States seeks . One day , my fellow citizens , there will be peace in Southeast Asia . It will come because the people of Southeast Asia want it those whose armies are at war tonight , and those who , though threatened , have thus far been spared . Peace will come because Asians were willing to work for it and to sacrifice for it and to die by the thousands for it . But let it never be forgotten Peace will come also because America sent her sons to help secure it . It has not been easy far from it . During the past 4 years , it has been my fate and my responsibility to be Commander in Chief . I have lived daily and nightly with the cost of this war . I know the pain that it has inflicted . I know , perhaps better than anyone , the misgivings that it has aroused . Throughout this entire , long period , I have been sustained by a single principle that what we are doing now , in Vietnam , is vital not only to the security of Southeast Asia , but it is vital to the security of every American . Surely we have treaties which we must respect . Surely we have commitments that we are going to keep . Resolutions of the Congress testify to the need to resist aggression in the world and in Southeast Asia . But the heart of our involvement in South Vietnam under three different presidents , three separate administrations has always been America s own security . And the larger purpose of our involvement has always been to help the nations of Southeast Asia become independent and stand alone , self sustaining , as members of a great world community at peace with themselves , and at peace with all others . With such an Asia , our country and the world will be far more secure than it is tonight . I believe that a peaceful Asia is far nearer to reality because of what America has done in Vietnam . I believe that the men who endure the dangers of battle fighting there for us tonight are helping the entire world avoid far greater conflicts , far wider wars , far more destruction , than this one . The peace that will bring them home someday will come . Tonight I have offered the first in what I hope will be a series of mutual moves toward peace . I pray that it will not be rejected by the leaders of North Vietnam . I pray that they will accept it as a means by which the sacrifices of their own people may be ended . And I ask your help and your support , my fellow citizens , for this effort to reach across the battlefield toward an early peace . Finally , my fellow Americans , let me say this Of those to whom much is given , much is asked . I cannot say and no man could say that no more will be asked of us . Yet , I believe that now , no less than when the decade began , this generation of Americans is willing to pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty . Since those words were spoken by John Kennedy , the people of America have kept that compact with mankind s noblest cause . And we shall continue to keep it . Yet , I believe that we must always be mindful of this one thing , whatever the trials and the tests ahead . The ultimate strength of our country and our cause will lie not in powerful weapons or infinite resources or boundless wealth , but will lie in the unity of our people . This I believe very deeply . Throughout my entire public career I have followed the personal philosophy that I am a free man , an American , a public servant , and a member of my party , in that order always and only . For 37 years in the service of our Nation , first as a Congressman , as a Senator , and as Vice President , and now as your President , I have put the unity of the people first . I have put it ahead of any divisive partisanship . And in these times as in times before , it is true that a house divided against itself by the spirit of faction , of party , of region , of religion , of race , is a house that cannot stand . There is division in the American house now . There is divisiveness among us all tonight . And holding the trust that is mine , as President of all the people , I cannot disregard the peril to the progress of the American people and the hope and the prospect of peace for all peoples . So , I would ask all Americans , whatever their personal interests or concern , to guard against divisiveness and all its ugly consequences . Fifty two months and 10 days ago , in a moment of tragedy and trauma , the duties of this office fell upon me . I asked then for your help and God s , that we might continue America on its course , binding up our wounds , healing our history , moving forward in new unity , to clear the American agenda and to keep the American commitment for all of our people . United we have kept that commitment . United we have enlarged that commitment . Through all time to come , I think America will be a stronger nation , a more just society , and a land of greater opportunity and fulfillment because of what we have all done together in these years of unparalleled achievement . Our reward will come in the life of freedom , peace , and hope that our children will enjoy through ages ahead . What we won when all of our people united just must not now be lost in suspicion , distrust , selfishness , and politics among any of our people . Believing this as I do , I have concluded that I should not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year . With America s sons in the fields far away , with America s future under challenge right here at home , with our hopes and the world s hopes for peace in the balance every day , I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office the Presidency of your country . Accordingly , I shall not seek , and I will not accept , the nomination of my party for another term as your President . But let men everywhere know , however , that a strong , a confident , and a vigilant America stands ready tonight to seek an honorable peace and stands ready tonight to defend an honored cause whatever the price , whatever the burden , whatever the sacrifice that duty may require . Thank you for listening . Good night and God bless all of you .<speech_sep>Vice President , Speaker , Members of Congress , members of the Cabinet , distinguished guests , my fellow Americans Today is a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield . Yet to seize the meaning of this day , we must recall darker times . Three and a half centuries ago the first Negroes arrived at Jamestown . They did not arrive in brave ships in search of a home for freedom . They did not mingle fear and joy , in expectation that in this New World anything would be possible to a man strong enough to reach for it . They came in darkness and they came in chains . And today we strike away the last major shackle of those fierce and ancient bonds . Today the Negro story and the American story fuse and blend . And let us remember that it was not always so . The stories of our Nation and of the American Negro are like two great rivers . Welling up from that tiny Jamestown spring they flow through the centuries along divided channels . When pioneers subdued a continent to the need of man , they did not tame it for the Negro . When the Liberty Bell rang out in Philadelphia , it did not toll for the Negro . When Andrew Jackson threw open the doors of democracy , they did not open for the Negro . It was only at Appomattox , a century ago , that an American victory was also a Negro victory . And the two rivers one shining with promise , the other dark stained with oppression began to move toward one another . Yet , for almost a century the promise of that day was not fulfilled . Today is a towering and certain mark that , in this generation , that promise will be kept . In our time the two currents will finally mingle and rush as one great stream across the uncertain and the marvelous years of the America that is yet to come . This act flows from a clear and simple wrong . Its only purpose is to right that wrong . Millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color . This law will ensure them the right to vote . The wrong is one which no American , in his heart , can justify . The right is one which no American , true to our principles , can deny . In 1957 , as the leader of the majority in the United States Senate , speaking in support of legislation to guarantee the right of all men to vote , I said , This right to vote is the basic right without which all others are meaningless . It gives people , people as individuals , control over their own destinies . Last year I said , Until every qualified person regardless of . . . the color of his skin has the right , unquestioned and unrestrained , to go in and cast his ballot in every precinct in this great land of ours , I am not going to be satisfied . Immediately after the election I directed the Attorney General to explore , as rapidly as possible , the ways to ensure the right to vote . And then last March , with the outrage of Selma still fresh , I came down to this Capitol one evening and asked the Congress and the people for swift and for sweeping action to guarantee to every man and woman the right to vote . In less than 48 hours I sent the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Congress . In little more than 4 months the Congress , with overwhelming majorities , enacted one of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American freedom . The Members of the Congress , and the many private citizens , who worked to shape and pass this bill will share a place of honor in our history for this one act alone . There were those who said this is an old injustice , and there is no need to hurry . But 95 years have passed since the 15th amendment gave all Negroes the right to vote . And the time for waiting is gone . There were those who said smaller and more gradual measures should be tried . But they had been tried . For years and years they had been tried , and tried , and tried , and they had failed , and failed , and failed . And the time for failure is gone . There were those who said that this is a many sided and very complex problem . But however viewed , the denial of the right to vote is still a deadly wrong . And the time for injustice has gone . This law covers many pages . But the heart of the act is plain . Wherever , by clear and objective standards , states and counties are using regulations , or laws , or tests to deny the right to vote , then they will be struck down . If it is clear that State officials still intend to discriminate , then Federal examiners will be sent in to register all eligible voters . When the prospect of discrimination is gone , the examiners will be immediately withdrawn . And , under this act , if any county anywhere in this Nation does not want Federal intervention it need only open its polling places to all of its people . This good Congress , the 89th Congress , acted swiftly in passing this act . I intend to act with equal dispatch in enforcing this act . And tomorrow at 1 p . m . , the Attorney General has been directed to file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the poll tax in the State of Mississippi . This will begin the legal process which , I confidently believe , will very soon prohibit any State from requiring the payment of money in order to exercise the fight to vote . And also by tomorrow the Justice Department , through publication in the Federal Register , will have officially certified the States where discrimination exists . I have , in addition , requested the Department of Justice to work all through this weekend so that on Monday morning next , they can designate many counties where past experience clearly shows that Federal action is necessary and required . And by Tuesday morning , trained Federal examiners will be at work registering eligible men and women in 10 to 15 counties . And on that same day , next Tuesday , additional poll tax suits will be filed in the States of Texas , Alabama , and Virginia . And I pledge you that we will not delay , or we will not hesitate , or we will not turn aside until Americans of every race and color and origin in this country have the same right as all others to share in the process of democracy . So , through this act , and its enforcement , an important instrument of freedom passes into the hands of millions of our citizens . But that instrument must be used . Presidents and Congresses , laws and lawsuits can open the doors to the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot . But only the individual Negro , and all others who have been denied the right to vote , can really walk through those doors , and can use that right , and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment . So , let me now say to every Negro in this country You must register . You must vote . You must learn , so your choice advances your interest and the interest of our beloved Nation . Your future , and your children s future , depend upon it , and I do not believe that you are going to let them down . This act is not only a victory for Negro leadership . This act is a great challenge to that leadership . It is a challenge which cannot be met simply by protests and demonstrations . It means that dedicated leaders must work around the clock to teach people their rights and their responsibilities and to lead them to exercise those rights and to fulfill those responsibilities and those duties to their country . If you do this , then you will find , as others have found before you , that the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men . Today what is perhaps the last of the legal barriers is tumbling . There will be many actions and many difficulties before the rights woven into law are also woven into the fabric of our Nation . But the struggle for equality must now move toward a different battlefield . It is nothing less than granting every American Negro his freedom to enter the mainstream of American life not the conformity that blurs enriching differences of culture and tradition , but rather the opportunity that gives each a chance to choose . For centuries of oppression and hatred have already taken their painful toll . It can be seen throughout our land in men without skills , in children without fathers , in families that are imprisoned in slums and in poverty . For it is not enough just to give men rights . They must be able to use those rights in their personal pursuit of happiness . The wounds and the weaknesses , the outward walls and the inward scars which diminish achievement are the work of American society . We must all now help to end them help to end them through expanding programs already devised and through new ones to search out and forever end the special handicaps of those who are black in a Nation that happens to be mostly white . So , it is for this purpose to fulfill the rights that we now secure that I have already called a White House conference to meet here in the Nation s Capital this fall . So , we will move step by step often painfully but , I think , with clear vision along the path toward American freedom . It is difficult to fight for freedom . But I also know how difficult it can be to bend long years of habit and custom to grant it . There is no room for injustice anywhere in the American mansion . But there is always room for understanding toward those who see the old ways crumbling . And to them today I say simply this It must come . It is right that it should come . And when it has , you will find that a burden has been lifted from your shoulders , too . It is not just a question of guilt , although there is that . It is that men cannot live with a lie and not be stained by it . The central fact of American civilization one so hard for others to understand is that freedom and justice and the dignity of man are not just words to us . We believe in them . Under all the growth and the tumult and abundance , we believe . And so , as long as some among us are oppressed and we are part of that oppression it must blunt our faith and sap the strength of our high purpose . Thus , this is a victory for the freedom of the American Negro . But it is also a victory for the freedom of the American Nation . And every family across this great , entire , searching land will live stronger in liberty , will live more splendid in expectation , and will be prouder to be American because of the act that you have passed that I will sign today . Thank you .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , members of the Congress , my fellow Americans On this Hill which was my home , I am stirred by old friendships . Though total agreement between the executive and the Congress is impossible , total respect is important . I am proud to be among my colleagues of the Congress whose legacy to their trust is their loyalty to their nation . I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new members of this body tonight . Twenty eight years ago , I felt as you do now . You will soon learn that you are among men whose first love is their country , men who try each day to do as best they can what they believe is right . We are entering the third century of the pursuit of American union . Two hundred years ago , in 1765 , nine assembled colonies first joined together to demand freedom from arbitrary power . For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man . One hundred years ago , in 1865 , following a terrible test of blood and fire , the compact of union was finally sealed . For a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many groups which make up the American community . That struggle has often brought pain and violence . It is not yet over . But we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in the history of freedom . And so tonight , now , in 1965 , we begin a new quest for union . We seek the unity of man with the world that he has built with the knowledge that can save or destroy him with the cities which can stimulate or stifle him with the wealth and the machines which can enrich or menace his spirit . We seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow each of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate the quality of our civilization . This is the search that we begin tonight . But the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in isolation . For today the state of the Union depends , in large measure , upon the state of the world . Our concern and interest , compassion and vigilance , extend to every corner of a dwindling planet . Yet , it is not merely our concern but the concern of all free men . We will not , and we should not , assume that it is the task of Americans alone to settle all the conflicts of a torn and troubled world . Let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this . For in concert with other nations , we shall help men defend their freedom . Our first aim remains the safety and the well being of our own country . We are prepared to live as good neighbors with all , but we cannot be indifferent to acts designed to injure our interests , or our citizens , or our establishments abroad . The community of nations requires mutual respect . We shall extend it and we shall expect it . In our relations with the world we shall follow the example of Andrew Jackson who said I intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong . And he promised , that the honor of my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the statement of truth or for the performance of duty . That was this nation s policy in the 1830s and that is this nation s policy in the 1960s . Our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the American dream . We were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide desert of disappointed dreams . Our nation was created to help strike away the chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they keep man less than God means him to be . We are moving toward that destiny , never more rapidly than we have moved in the last four years . In this period we have built a military power strong enough to meet any threat and destroy any adversary . And that superiority will continue to grow so long as this office is mine and you sit on Capitol Hill . In this period no new nation has become Communist , and the unity of the Communist empire has begun to crumble . In this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our neighbors of the hemisphere , and joined in an Alliance for Progress toward economic growth and political democracy . In this period we have taken more steps toward peace including the test ban treaty than at any time since the Cold War began . In this period we have relentlessly pursued our advances toward the conquest of space . Most important of all , in this period , the United States has reemerged into the fullness of its self confidence and purpose . No longer are we called upon to get America moving . We are moving . No longer do we doubt our strength or resolution . We are strong and we have proven our resolve . No longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay . We know that history is ours to make . And if there is great danger , there is now also the excitement of great expectations . Yet we still live in a troubled and perilous world . There is no longer a single threat . There are many . They differ in intensity and in danger . They require different attitudes and different answers . With the Soviet Union we seek peaceful understandings that can lessen the danger to freedom . Last fall I asked the American people to choose that course . I will carry forward their command . If we are to live together in peace , we must come to know each other better . I am sure that the American people would welcome a chance to listen to the Soviet leaders on our television as I would like the Soviet people to hear our leaders on theirs . I hope the new Soviet leaders can visit America so they can learn about our country at firsthand . In Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their identity . Your government , assisted by the leaders in American labor and business , is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these countries and with the Soviet Union . I will report our conclusions to the Congress . In Asia , communism wears a more aggressive face . We see that in Vietnam . Why are we there We are there , first , because a friendly nation has asked us for help against the Communist aggression . Ten years ago our President pledged our help . Three Presidents have supported that pledge . We will not break it now . Second , our own security is tied to the peace of Asia . Twice in one generation we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East . To ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war . Our goal is peace in Southeast Asia . That will come only when aggressors leave their neighbors in peace . What is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will never be found wanting . But Communism is not the only source of trouble and unrest . There are older and deeper sources in the misery of nations and in man s irrepressible ambition for liberty and a better life . With the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt and my country has always felt very special ties of interest and affection . It will be the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties . Together we share and shape the destiny of the new world . In the coming year I hope to pay a visit to Latin America . And I will steadily enlarge our commitment to the Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and injustice in this hemisphere . In the Atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 years a Europe that is growing in strength , unity , and cooperation with America . A great unfinished task is the reunification of Germany through self determination . This European policy is not based on any abstract design . It is based on the realities of common interests and common values , common dangers and common expectations . These realities will continue to have their way especially , I think , in our expanding trade and especially in our common defense . Free Americans have shaped the policies of the United States . And because we know these realities , those policies have been , and will be , in the interest of Europe . Free Europeans must shape the course of Europe . And , for the same reasons , that course has been , and will be , in our interest and in the interest of freedom . I found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the last year . I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe this year . In Africa and Asia we are witnessing the turbulent unfolding of new nations and continents . We welcome them to the society of nations . We are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own independence , and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to the welfare of all of their people . We seek not fidelity to an iron faith , but a diversity of belief as varied as man himself . We seek not to extend the power of America but the progress of humanity . We seek not to dominate others but to strengthen the freedom of all people . I will seek new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the growing scarcity in world resources . Finally , we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the effectiveness of the United Nations . The frustrations of the United Nations are a product of the world that we live in , and not of the institution which gives them voice . It is far better to throw these differences open to the assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger . These are some of the goals of the American nation in the world in which we live . For ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame , neither gratitude nor obedience . We seek peace . We seek freedom . We seek to enrich the life of man . For that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that we mean for all men to ultimately have . World affairs will continue to call upon our energy and our courage . But today we can turn increased attention to the character of American life . We are in the midst of the greatest upward surge of economic well being in the history of any nation . Our flourishing progress has been marked by price stability that is unequalled in the world . Our balance of payments deficit has declined and the soundness of our dollar is unquestioned . I pledge to keep it that way and I urge business and labor to cooperate to that end . We worked for two centuries to climb this peak of prosperity . But we are only at the beginning of the road to the Great Society . Ahead now is a summit where freedom from the wants of the body can help fulfill the needs of the spirit . We built this nation to serve its people . We want to grow and build and create , but we want progress to be the servant and not the master of man . We do not intend to live in the midst of abundance , isolated from neighbors and nature , confined by blighted cities and bleak suburbs , stunted by a poverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure . The Great Society asks not how much , but how good not only how to create wealth but how to use it not only how fast we are going , but where we are headed . It proposes as the first test for a nation the quality of its people . This kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swelling riches and surging power . It will not be the gift of government or the creation of Presidents . It will require of every American , for many generations , both faith in the destination and the fortitude to make the journey . And like freedom itself , it will always be challenge and not fulfillment . And tonight we accept that challenge . I propose that we begin a program in education to ensure every American child the fullest development of his mind and skills . I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing diseases . I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a better and a more stimulating place to live . I propose that we increase the beauty of America and end the poisoning of our rivers and the air that we breathe . I propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country that are now suffering from distress and depression . I propose that we make new efforts to control and prevent crime and delinquency . I propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and the opportunity to vote . I propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the creations of art . I propose that we make an all out campaign against waste and inefficiency . Our basic task is threefold First , to keep our economy growing to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most Americans and to improve the quality of life for all . In the next six weeks I will submit special messages with detailed proposals for national action in each of these areas . Tonight I would like just briefly to explain some of my major recommendations in the three main areas of national need . First , we must keep our nation prosperous . We seek full employment opportunity for every American citizen . I will present a budget designed to move the economy forward . More money will be left in the hands of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes . We will continue along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy . I confidently predict what every economic sign tells us tonight the continued flourishing of the American economy . But we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact of a recession . The knowledge that our government will , and can , move swiftly will strengthen the confidence of investors and business . Congress can reinforce this confidence by insuring that its procedures permit rapid action on temporary income tax cuts . And special funds for job creating public programs should be made available for immediate use if recession threatens . Our continued prosperity demands continued price stability . Business , labor , and the consumer all have a high stake in keeping wages and prices within the framework of the guideposts that have already served the nation so well . Finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of American business . But we stand ready with credit and other help to assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire nation . Our economy owes much to the efficiency of our farmers . We must continue to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward . I have instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to lead a major effort to find new approaches to reduce the heavy cost of our farm programs and to direct more of our effort to the small farmer who needs the help the most . We can help insure continued prosperity through a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken areas left behind by our national progress further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern technology , for the laboring man is an indispensable force in the American system the extension of the minimum wage to more than two million unprotected workers the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation system . And as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms , I will propose to Congress changes in the Taft Hartley Act including section 14 b . I will do so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided Americans in various States of our Union . In a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to continued growth . I will recommend heavier reliance on competition in transportation and a new policy for our merchant marine . I will ask for funds to study high speed rail transportation between urban centers . We will begin with test projects between Washington and Boston . On high speed trains , passengers could travel this distance in less than four hours . Second , we must open opportunity to all our people . Most Americans enjoy a good life . But far too many are still trapped in poverty and idleness and fear . Let a just nation throw open to them the city of promise to the elderly , by providing hospital care under social security and by raising benefit payments to those struggling to maintain the dignity of their later years to the poor and the unfortunate , through doubling the war against poverty this year to Negro Americans , through enforcement of the civil rights law and elimination of barriers to the right to vote to those in other lands that are seeking the promise of America , through an immigration law based on the work a man can do and not where he was born or how he spells his name . Our third goal is to improve the quality of American life . We begin with learning . Every child must have the best education that this nation can provide . Thomas Jefferson said that no nation can be both ignorant and free . Today no nation can be both ignorant and great . In addition to our existing programs , I will recommend a new program for schools and students with a first year authorization of 1 , 500 million . It will help at every stage along the road to learning . For the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the excitement of learning . For the primary and secondary school years we will aid public schools serving low income families and assist students in both public and private schools . For the college years we will provide scholarships to high school students of the greatest promise and the greatest need and we will guarantee low interest loans to students continuing their college studies . New laboratories and centers will help our schools help them lift their standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching . These centers will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve special treatment . Greatness requires not only an educated people but a healthy people . Our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of our people . We already carry on a large program in this country , for research and health . In addition , regional medical centers can provide the most advanced diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other major diseases . New support for medical and dental education will provide the trained people to apply our knowledge . Community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for school age children from poor families , including services for the mentally retarded . An educated and healthy people require surroundings in harmony with their hopes . In our urban areas the central problem today is to protect and restore man s satisfaction in belonging to a community where he can find security and significance . The first step is to break old patterns to begin to think and work and plan for the development of the entire metropolitan areas . We will take this step with new programs of help for the basic community facilities and for neighborhood centers of health and recreation . New and existing programs will be open to those cities which work together to develop unified long range policies for metropolitan areas . We must also make some very important changes in our housing programs if we are to pursue these same basic goals . So a Department of Housing and Urban Development will be needed to spearhead this effort in our cities . Every citizen has the right to feel secure in his home and on the streets of his community . To help control crime , we will recommend programs to train local law enforcement officers to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal to discover the causes of crime and better ways to prevent it . I will soon assemble a panel of outstanding experts of this nation to search out answers to the national problem of crime and delinquency , and I welcome the recommendations and the constructive efforts of the Congress . For over three centuries the beauty of America has sustained our spirit and has enlarged our vision . We must act now to protect this heritage . In a fruitful new partnership with the states and the cities the next decade should be a conservation milestone . We must make a massive effort to save the countryside and to establish as a green legacy for tomorrow more large and small parks , more seashores and open spaces than have been created during any other period in our national history . A new and substantial effort must be made to landscape highways to provide places of relaxation and recreation wherever our roads run , Within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation . We will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water before it happens . We will step up our effort to control harmful wastes , giving first priority to the cleanup of our most contaminated rivers . We will increase research to learn much more about the control of pollution . We hope to make the Potomac a model of beauty here in the capital , and preserve unspoiled stretches of some of our waterways with a Wild Rivers bill . More ideas for a beautiful America will emerge from a White House Conference on Natural Beauty which I will soon call . We must also recognize and encourage those who can be pathfinders for the nation s imagination and understanding . To help promote and honor creative achievements , I will propose a National Foundation on the Arts . To develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress , I will recommend programs to encourage basic science , particularly in the universities and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our growing need for fresh water . For government to serve these goals it must be modern in structure , efficient in action , and ready for any emergency . I am busy , currently , reviewing the structure of the entire executive branch of this government . I hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to meet more effectively the tasks of the 20th century . Wherever waste is found , I will eliminate it . Last year we saved almost 3 , 500 million by eliminating waste in the national government . And I intend to do better this year . And very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies that your government plans to make . Even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards . I will propose laws to insure the necessary continuity of leadership should the President become disabled or die . In addition , I will propose reforms in the Electoral College leaving undisturbed the vote by states but making sure that no elector can substitute his will for that of the people . Last year , in a sad moment , I came here and I spoke to you after 33 years of public service , practically all of them here on this Hill . This year I speak after one year as President of the United States . Many of you in this chamber are among my oldest friends . We have shared many happy moments and many hours of work , and we have watched many Presidents together . Yet , only in the White House can you finally know the full weight of this Office . The greatest burden is not running the huge operations of government or meeting daily troubles , large and small or even working with the Congress . A President s hardest task is not to do what is right , but to know what is right . Yet the Presidency brings no special gift of prophecy or foresight . You take an oath , you step into an office , and you must then help guide a great democracy . The answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born . It was once barren land . The angular hills were covered with scrub cedar and a few large live oaks . Little would grow in that harsh caliche soil of my country . And each spring the Pedernales River would flood our valley . But men came and they worked and they endured and they built . And tonight that country is abundant abundant with fruit and cattle and goats and sheep , and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are gone . Why did men come to that once forbidding land Well , they were restless , of course , and they had to be moving on . But there was more than that . There was a dream a dream of a place where a free man could build for himself , and raise his children to a better life a dream of a continent to be conquered , a world to be won , a nation to be made . Remembering this , I knew the answer . A President does not shape a new and personal vision of America . He collects it from the scattered hopes of the American past . It existed when the first settlers saw the coast of a new world , and when the first pioneers moved westward . It has guided us every step of the way . It sustains every President . But it is also your inheritance and it belongs equally to all the people that we all serve . It must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs as I have tried , in part , to do tonight . It shall lead us as we enter the third century of the search for a more perfect union This , then , is the state of the Union Free and restless , growing and full of hope . So it was in the beginning . So it shall always be , while God is willing , and we are strong enough to keep the faith .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans As President and Commander in Chief , it is my duty to the American people to report that renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action in reply . The initial attack on the destroyer Maddox , on August 2 , was repeated today by a number of hostile vessels attacking two destroyers with torpedoes . The destroyers and supporting aircraft acted at once on the orders I gave after the initial act of aggression . We believe at least two of the attacking boats were sunk . There were no losses . The performance of commanders and crews in this engagement is in the highest tradition of the United States Navy . But repeated acts of violence against the Armed Forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense , but with positive reply . That reply is being given as I speak to you tonight . Air action is now in execution against gunboats and certain supporting facilities in North Viet Nam which have been used in these hostile operations . In the larger sense this new act of aggression , aimed directly at our own forces , again brings home to all of us in the United States the importance of the struggle for peace and security in southeast Asia . Aggression by terror against the peaceful villagers of South Viet Nam has now been joined by open aggression on the high seas against the United States of America . The determination of all Americans to carry out our full commitment to the people and to the government of South Viet Nam will be redoubled by this outrage . Yet our response , for the present , will be limited and fitting . We Americans know , although others appear to forget , the risks of spreading conflict . We still seek no wider war . I have instructed the Secretary of State to make this position totally clear to friends and to adversaries and , indeed , to all . I have instructed Ambassador Stevenson to raise this matter immediately and urgently before the Security Council of the United Nations . Finally , I have today met with the leaders of both parties in the Congress of the United States and I have informed them that I shall immediately request the Congress to pass a resolution making it clear that our Government is united in its determination to take all necessary measures in support of freedom and in defense of peace in southeast Asia . I have been given encouraging assurance by these leaders of both parties that such a resolution will be promptly introduced , freely and expeditiously debated , and passed with overwhelming support . And just a few minutes ago I was able to reach Senator Goldwater and I am glad to say that he has expressed his support of the statement that I am making to you tonight . It is a solemn responsibility to have to order even limited military action by forces whose overall strength is as vast and as awesome as those of the United States of America , but it is my considered conviction , shared throughout your Government , that firmness in the right is indispensable today for peace that firmness will always be measured . Its mission is peace .<speech_sep>In the early morning today , Governor Romney communicated with Attorney General Ramsey Clark and told him of the extreme disorder in Detroit , Michigan . The Attorney General kept me advised throughout the morning . At 10 56 this morning , I received a wire from Governor Romney officially requesting that Federal troops be dispatched to Michigan . This wire had been sent at 10 46 a . m . At 11 02 a . m . this morning , I instructed the Secretary of Defense , McNamara , to initiate the movement of the troops which the Governor had requested . At the same time , I advised the Governor by telegram that the troops would be sent to Selfridge Air Base just northeast of Detroit and would be available to support and to assist the some 8 , 000 Michigan National Guardsmen and the several thousand State and local police under the command of Governor Romney and the mayor of Detroit . I informed the Governor that these troops would arrive this afternoon . I also informed the Governor that immediately Cyrus Vance , as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense , and others would proceed to Detroit for conferences with the Governor and other appropriate officials . This plan proceeded precisely as scheduled . Approximately 5 , 000 Federal troops were on their way by airlift to Detroit , Michigan , within a few hours . Vance , General Throckmorton , and others were in Detroit and in conference with Governor Romney by the middle of this afternoon . Their initial report was that it then appeared that the situation might be controlled without bringing the Federal troops from the Selfridge Air Force Base into downtown Detroit . They , therefore , recommended to the President that the troops be maintained on a 30 minute alert and they advised that they would be in continual touch with the situation and with Secretary McNamara and me , making periodic reports about every 30 minutes . At approximately 10 30 this evening , Vance and General Throckmorton reported to me by telephone that it was the then unanimous opinion of all the State and Federal officials who were in consultation including Governor Romney , Vance , General Throckmorton , the mayor , and others that the situation had developed in such a way in the few intervening hours as to make the use of Federal troops to augment the police and Michigan National Guard imperative . They described the situation in considerable detail , including the violence and deaths that had occurred in the past few hours , and submitted as the unanimous judgment of all concerned that the situation was totally beyond the control of the local authorities . On the basis of this confirmation of the need for participation by Federal troops , and pursuant to the official request made by the Governor of the State of Michigan , in which Mayor Cavanagh of Detroit joined , I forthwith issued the necessary proclamation and Executive order as provided by the Constitution and the statutes . I advised Vance and General Throckmorton to proceed immediately with the transportation of the Federal troops from Selfridge Air Force Base to places of deployment within Detroit a movement which they had already provisionally begun , pursuant to their authority . I am sure the American people will realize that I take this action with the greatest regret and only because of the clear , unmistakable , and undisputed evidence that Governor Romney of Michigan and the local officials in Detroit have been unable to bring the situation under control . Law enforcement is a local matter . It is the responsibility of local officials and the Governors of the respective States . The Federal Government should not intervene except in the most extraordinary circumstances . The fact of the matter , however , is that law and order have broken down in Detroit , Michigan . Pillage , looting , murder , and arson have nothing to do with civil rights . They are criminal conduct . The Federal Government in the circumstances here presented had no alternative but to respond , since it was called upon by the Governor of the State and since it was presented with proof of his inability to restore order in Michigan . We will not tolerate lawlessness . We will not endure violence . It matters not by whom it is done or under what slogan or banner . It will not be tolerated . This Nation will do whatever it is necessary to do to suppress and to punish those who engage in it . I know that with few exceptions the people of Detroit , and the people of Newark , and the people of Harlem , and of all of our American cities , however troubled they may be , deplore and condemn these criminal acts . I know that the vast majority of Negroes and whites are shocked and outraged by them . So tonight , your President calls upon all of our people , in all of our cities , to join in a determined program to maintain law and order to condemn and to combat lawlessness in all of its forms and firmly to show by word and by deed that riots , looting , and public disorder will just not be tolerated . In particular , I call upon the people of the ravaged areas to return to their homes , to leave the streets , and to permit the authorities to restore quiet and order without further loss of life or property damage . Once this is done , attention can immediately be turned to the great and urgent problems of repairing the damage that has been done . I appeal to every American in this grave hour to respond to this plea .<speech_sep>I have just concluded a meeting with the leaders of the Congress . I reported to them on the serious situation in the Dominican Republic . I reported the decisions that this Government considers necessary in this situation in order to protect American lives . The members of the leadership expressed their support of these decisions . The United States Government has been informed by military authorities in the Dominican Republic that American lives are in danger . These authorities are no longer able to guarantee their safety and they have reported that the assistance of military personnel is now needed for that purpose . I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to put the necessary American troops ashore in order to give protection to hundreds of Americans who are still in the Dominican Republic and to escort them safely back to this country . This same assistance will be available to the nationals of other countries , some of whom have already asked for our help . Pursuant to my instructions 400 Marines have already landed . General Wheeler , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , has just reported to me that there have been no incidents . We have appealed repeatedly in recent days for a cease fire between the contending forces of the Dominican Republic in the interests of all Dominicans and foreigners alike . I repeat this urgent appeal again tonight . The Council of the OAS has been advised of the situation by the Dominican Ambassador and the Council will be kept fully informed .<speech_sep>President , Secretary General , distinguished delegates to the United Nations , ladies and gentlemen We meet in a time of mourning , but in a moment of rededication . My Nation has lost a great leader . This organization has lost a great friend . World peace has lost a great champion . But John Kennedy was the author of new hope for mankind , hope which was shared by a whole new generation of leaders in every continent , and we must not let grief turn us away from that hope . He never quarreled with the past . He always looked at the future . And our task now is to work for the kind of future in which he so strongly believed . I have come here today to make it unmistakably clear that the assassin s bullet which took his life did not alter his Nation s purpose . We are more than ever opposed to the doctrines of hate and violence , in our own land and around the world . We are more than ever committed to the rule of law , in our own land and around the world . We believe more than ever in the rights of man , all men of every color , in our own land and around the world . And more than ever we support the United Nations as the best instrument yet devised to promote the peace of the world and to promote the well being of mankind . I can tell you today , as I told you in 1958 when I came as Majority Leader of the United States Senate to the first committee of this great tribunal , that the full power and partnership of the United States is committed to our joint effort to eliminate war and the threat of war , aggression and the danger of violence , and to lift from all people everywhere the blight of disease , and poverty , and illiteracy . I . Like all human institutions , the United Nations has not achieved the highest of hopes that some held at its birth . Our understanding of how to live , live with one another , is still far behind our knowledge of how to destroy one another . But as our problems have grown , this Organization has grown , in numbers , in authority , in prestige , and its member nations have grown with it , in responsibility and in maturity . We have seen too much success to become obsessed with failure . The peace keeping machinery of the United Nations has worked in the Congo , in the Middle East , and elsewhere . The great transition from colonial rule to independence has been largely accomplished . The Decade of Development has successfully begun . The world arms race has been slowed . The struggle for human rights has been gaining new force . And a start has been made in furthering mankind s common interest in outer space in scientific exploration , in communications , in weather forecasting , in banning the stationing of nuclear weapons , and in establishing principles of law . I know that vast problems remain , conflicts between great powers , conflicts between small neighbors , disagreements over disarmament , persistence of ancient wrongs in the area of human rights , residual problems , of colonialism , and all the rest . But men and nations , working apart , created these problems , and men and nations working together must solve them . They can solve them with the help of this Organization , when all members make it a workshop for constructive action , and not a forum for abuse when all members seek its help in settling their own disputes as well as the disputes of others when all members meet their financial obligations to it and when all members recognize that no nation and no party and no single system can control the future of man . IWhen I entered the Congress of the United States 27 years ago , it was my very great privilege to work closely with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . As a Member of Congress , I worked with him to bring about a profound but peaceful revolution . That peaceful revolution brought help and hope to the one third of our Nation that was then ill housed , ill clad , and ill nourished . We helped our working men and women obtain more jobs and we helped them obtain better wages . We helped our farmers to buy and improve their own land , and conserve their soil and water , and electrify their farms . We harnessed the powers of the great rivers , as in the Tennessee Valley and the Lower Colorado . We encouraged the growth of cooperatives and trade unions . We curbed the excesses of private speculation . We built homes in the place of city slums . And we extended the rights of freedom to all of our citizens . Now , on the world scale , the time has come , as it came to America 30 years ago , for a new era of hope , hope and progress for that one third of mankind that is still beset by hunger and poverty and disease . In my travels on behalf of my country and President Kennedy , I have seen too much of misery and despair in Africa , in Asia , in Latin America . I have seen too often the ravages of hunger , and tapeworm and tuberculosis , and the scabs and the scars on too many children who have too little health and no hope . I think that you and I and our countries and this Organization can , and must , do something about these conditions . I am not speaking here of a new way of life to be imposed by any single nation . I am speaking of a higher standard of living , to be inspired by these United Nations . It will not be achieved through some hopeful resolution in this assembly , but through a peaceful revolution in the world , through a recommitment of all our members , rich and poor , and strong and weak , whatever their location or their ideology , to the basic principles of human welfare and of human dignity . In this effort , the United States will do its full share . In addition to bilateral aid , we have with great satisfaction assisted in recent years in the emergence and the improvement of international developmental institutions , both within and without this Organization . We favor the steady improvement of collective machinery for helping the less developed nations build modern societies . We favor an international aid program that is international in practice as well as purpose . Every nation must do its share . All United Nations and their members can do better . We can act more often together . We can build together a much better world . IIThe greatest of human problems , and the greatest of our common tasks , is to keep the peace and to save the future . All that we have built in the wealth of nations , and all that we plan to do toward a better life for all , will be in vain if our feet should slip , or our vision falter , and our hopes ended in another worldwide war . If there is one commitment more than any other that I would like to leave with you today , it is my unswerving commitment to the keeping and to the strengthening of the peace . Peace is a journey of a thousand miles , and it must be taken one step at a time . We know what we want The United States of America wants to see the cold war end , we want to see it end once and for all The United States wants to prevent the dissemination of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them The United States wants to press on with arms control and reduction The United States wants to cooperate with all the members of this Organization to conquer everywhere the ancient enemies of mankind hunger , and disease and ignorance The United States wants sanity , and security , and peace for all , and above all . President Kennedy , I am sure , would regard as his best memorial the fact that in his3 years as President the world became a little safer and the way ahead became a little brighter . To the protection and the enlargement of this new hope for peace , I pledge my country and its Government . IMy friends and fellow citizens of the world , soon you will return to your homelands . I hope you will take with you my gratitude for your generosity in hearing me so late in the session . I hope you will convey to your countrymen the gratitude of all Americans for the companionship of sorrow which you shared with us in your messages of the last few weeks . And I hope that you will tell them that the United States of America , sobered by tragedy , united in sorrow , renewed in spirit , faces the New Year determined that world peace , civil rights , and human welfare become not an illusion but a reality . Man s age old hopes remain our goal that this world , under God , can be safe for diversity , and free from hostility , and a better place for our children and for all generations in the years to come . And therefore any man and any nation that seeks peace , and hates war , and is willing to fight the good fight against hunger and disease and ignorance and misery , will find the United States of America by their side , willing to walk with them , walk with them every step of the way . Thank you very much . President , Secretary General , distinguished delegates to the United Nations , ladies and gentlemen We meet in a time of mourning , but in a moment of rededication . My Nation has lost a great leader . This organization has lost a great friend . World peace has lost a great champion . But John Kennedy was the author of new hope for mankind , hope which was shared by a whole new generation of leaders in every continent , and we must not let grief turn us away from that hope . He never quarreled with the past . He always looked at the future . And our task now is to work for the kind of future in which he so strongly believed . I have come here today to make it unmistakably clear that the assassin s bullet which took his life did not alter his Nation s purpose . We are more than ever opposed to the doctrines of hate and violence , in our own land and around the world . We are more than ever committed to the rule of law , in our own land and around the world . We believe more than ever in the rights of man , all men of every color , in our own land and around the world . And more than ever we support the United Nations as the best instrument yet devised to promote the peace of the world and to promote the well being of mankind . I can tell you today , as I told you in 1958 when I came as Majority Leader of the United States Senate to the first committee of this great tribunal , that the full power and partnership of the United States is committed to our joint effort to eliminate war and the threat of war , aggression and the danger of violence , and to lift from all people everywhere the blight of disease , and poverty , and illiteracy . Like all human institutions , the United Nations has not achieved the highest of hopes that some held at its birth . Our understanding of how to live , live with one another , is still far behind our knowledge of how to destroy one another . But as our problems have grown , this Organization has grown , in numbers , in authority , in prestige , and its member nations have grown with it , in responsibility and in maturity . We have seen too much success to become obsessed with failure . The peace keeping machinery of the United Nations has worked in the Congo , in the Middle East , and elsewhere . The great transition from colonial rule to independence has been largely accomplished . The Decade of Development has successfully begun . The world arms race has been slowed . The struggle for human rights has been gaining new force . And a start has been made in furthering mankind s common interest in outer space in scientific exploration , in communications , in weather forecasting , in banning the stationing of nuclear weapons , and in establishing principles of law . I know that vast problems remain , conflicts between great powers , conflicts between small neighbors , disagreements over disarmament , persistence of ancient wrongs in the area of human rights , residual problems , of colonialism , and all the rest . But men and nations , working apart , created these problems , and men and nations working together must solve them . They can solve them with the help of this organization , when all members make it a workshop for constructive action , and not a forum for abuse when all members seek its help in settling their own disputes as well as the disputes of others when all members meet their financial obligations to it and when all members recognize that no nation and no party and no single system can control the future of man . When I entered the Congress of the United States 27 years ago , it was my very great privilege to work closely with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . As a Member of Congress , I worked with him to bring about a profound but peaceful revolution . That peaceful revolution brought help and hope to the one third of our Nation that was then ill housed , ill clad , and ill nourished . We helped our working men and women obtain more jobs and we helped them obtain better wages . We helped our farmers to buy and improve their own land , and conserve their soil and water , and electrify their farms . We harnessed the powers of the great rivers , as in the Tennessee Valley and the Lower Colorado . We encouraged the growth of cooperatives and trade unions . We curbed the excesses of private speculation . We built homes in the place of city slums . And we extended the rights of freedom to all of our citizens . Now , on the world scale , the time has come , as it came to America 30 years ago , for a new era of hope , hope and progress for that one third of mankind that is still beset by hunger and poverty and disease . In my travels on behalf of my country and President Kennedy , I have seen too much of misery and despair in Africa , in Asia , in Latin America . I have seen too often the ravages of hunger , and tapeworm and tuberculosis , and the scabs and the scars on too many children who have too little health and no hope . I think that you and I and our countries and this organization can , and must , do something about these conditions . I am not speaking here of a new way of life to be imposed by any single nation . I am speaking of a higher standard of living , to be inspired by these United Nations . It will not be achieved through some hopeful resolution in this assembly , but through a peaceful revolution in the world , through a recommitment of all our members , rich and poor , and strong and weak , whatever their location or their ideology , to the basic principles of human welfare and of human dignity . In this effort , the United States will do its full share . In addition to bilateral aid , we have with great satisfaction assisted in recent years in the emergence and the improvement of international developmental institutions , both within and without this Organization .

In a large measure , America s history is a history of her transportation . Our early cities were located by deep water harbors and inland waterways they were nurtured by ocean vessels and by flatboats . The railroad allowed us to move east and west . A thousand towns and more grew up along the railroad s gleaming rails . The automobile stretched out over cities and created suburbia in America . Trucks and modern highways brought bounty to remote regions . Airplanes helped knit our Nation together , and knitted it together with other nations throughout the world . And today , all Americans are really neighbors . Transportation is the biggest industry we have in this country . It involves one out of every five dollars in our economy . Our system of transportation is the greatest of any country in the world . But we must face facts . We must be realistic . We must know and we must have the courage to let our people know that our system is no longer adequate . During the next two decades , the demand for transportation in this country is going to more than double . But we are already falling far behind with the demand as it is . Our lifeline is tangled . Today we are confronted by traffic jams . Today we are confronted by commuter crises , by crowded airports , by crowded air lanes , by screeching airplanes , by archaic equipment , by safety abuses , and roads that scar our Nation s beauty . We have come to this historic East Room of the White House today to establish and to bring into being a Department of Transportation , the second Cabinet office to be added to the President s Cabinet in recent months . This Department of Transportation that we are establishing will have a mammoth task to untangle , to coordinate , and to build the national transportation system for America that America is deserving of . And because the job is great , I intend to appoint a strong man to fill it . The new Secretary will be my principal adviser and my strong right arm on all transportation matters . I hope he will be the best equipped man in this country to give leadership to the country , to the President , to the Cabinet , to the Congress . Among the many duties the new department will have , several deserve very special notice . To improve the safety in every means of transportation , safety of our automobiles , our trains , our planes , and our ships . To bring new technology to every mode of transportation by supporting and promoting research and development . To solve our most pressing transportation problems . A day will come in America when people and freight will move through this land of ours speedily , efficiently , safely , dependably , and cheaply . That will be a good day and a great day in America . Our transportation system was built by the genius of free enterprise . And as long as I am President , it will be sustained by free enterprise . In a few respects , this bill falls short of our original hopes . It does not include the Maritime Administration . As experience is gained in the department , I would hope that the Congress could reexamine its decision to leave this key transportation activity alone , outside its jurisdiction . But what is most important , I think , is that you , for the first time in modern history , have created and have brought for me to sign , a measure giving us a new Cabinet department . It was proposed , it will be established , and it will be in operation in the same year . All of these things took place in the same year . It is the second major step in bringing our Government up to date with the times . Last year this Congress established the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs . Today you bring 31 agencies and their bureaus , going in all directions , into a single Department of Transportation under the guidance and leadership of a Secretary of Transportation . I think in fairness , candor requires me to review that this recommendation was made many years ago by the Hoover Commission , headed by the distinguished former President . This recommendation was urged upon the Congress and the people , and recommended many years ago by a most distinguished and popular President , President Dwight David Eisenhower . This recommendation was made and urged upon the President and the Congress many years ago by the Senate Commerce Committee , and by dozens and dozens of enlightened , intelligent Members of both Houses of both parties . What we are here today to do is to salute the members of both parties , the leadership of both parties , and everyone who contributed to finally bringing our performance in line with our promise . And I do not guess it would be good to say this , and I may even be criticized for saying it , but this , in effect , is another coonskin on the wall .<speech_sep>
