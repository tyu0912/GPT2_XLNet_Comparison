Speaker , President , members of the House and the Senate , my fellow Americans I come before you tonight to report on the State of the Union for the third time . I come here to thank you and to add my tribute , once more , to the nation s gratitude for this , the 89th Congress . This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America . Our nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam . Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you . It just must be the center of our concerns . But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people . This nation is mighty enough , its society is healthy enough , its people are strong enough , to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home . And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight . I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward , with full vigor , the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year . I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty . I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program , designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves , and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth . I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union . I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely , on a scale never before attempted , entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America . I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers , and , as the cornerstone of this effort , clean completely entire large river basins . I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire federal system from prevention to probation . I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in federal and state jury selection , by making it a serious federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights , and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing . I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the federal government by creating a new Cabinet level Department of Transportation and reorganizing several existing agencies . In turn , I will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed , and ability will be both required as well as rewarded . I will ask you to make it possible for members of the House of Representatives to work more effectively in the service of the nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to four years , concurrent with that of the President . Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should , or all that we would like to do . We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency . We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it . We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society . Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased 47 billion , and it will soar again this year to a total over 720 billion . Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues , if you approve every program that I recommend tonight , our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years . It will be only 1 . 8 billion next year . Total spending in the administrative budget will be 112 . 8 billion . Revenues next year will be 111 billion . On a cash basis which is the way that you and I keep our family budget the federal budget next year will actually show a surplus . That is to say , if we include all the money that your government will take in and all the money that your government will spend , your government next year will collect one half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967 . I have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures . I have come here to recommend that you , the representatives of the richest nation on earth , you , the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe , you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans . There are men who cry out We must sacrifice . Well , let us rather ask them Who will they sacrifice Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning , or the sick who need medical care , or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed , the beauty of our land , the hope of our poor Time may require further sacrifices . And if it does , then we will make them . But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty . I believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam . But if there are some who do not believe this , then , in the name of justice , let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing , rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need . And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight . Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great chamber . The Great Society leads us along three roads growth and justice and liberation . First is growth the national prosperity which supports the well being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress . I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already in every city and countryside . This nation is flourishing . Workers are making more money than ever with after tax income in the past five years up 33 percent in the last year alone , up 8 percent . More people are working than ever before in our history an increase last year of two and a half million jobs . Corporations have greater after tax earnings than ever in history . For the past five years those earnings have been up over 65 percent , and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent . Average farm income is higher than ever . Over the past five years it is up 40 percent , and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone . I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from 2 . 8 billion in 1964 to 1 . 3 billion , or less , in 1965 . This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your government . We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year . And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land . It is essential , to prevent inflation , that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint , and I do so again tonight . I believe it desirable , because of increased military expenditures , that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago . Without raising taxes or even increasing the total tax bill paid we should move to improve our withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go , speed up the collection of corporate taxes , and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date . I hope these measures will be adequate . But if the necessities of Vietnam require it , I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional appropriations , or additional revenues if they are needed . The second road is justice . Justice means a man s hope should not be limited by the color of his skin . I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in federal and state courts and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements . I propose legislation to strengthen authority of federal courts to try those who murder , attack , or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime . Legislation , resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the federal government , to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing . For that other nation within a nation the poor whose distress has now captured the conscience of America , I will ask the Congress not only to continue , but to speed up the war on poverty . And in so doing , we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience . To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population , we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts , improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams , better health measures , physical examinations , and adequate and available medical resources . For those who labor , I propose to improve unemployment insurance , to expand minimum wage benefits , and by the repeal of section 14 b of the Taft Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our states equal to the laws of the 31 states which do not have tonight right to work measures . And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which , without improperly invading state and local authority , will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest . The third path is the path of liberation . It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives . A great nation is one which breeds a great people . A great people flower not from wealth and power , but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius . That alone is a Great Society . Yet , slowly , painfully , on the edge of victory , has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough . In the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life , and which individual abundance alone will not overcome . We can subdue and we can master these forces bring increased meaning to our lives if all of us , government and citizens , are bold enough to change old ways , daring enough to assault new dangers , and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people . This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life . Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year , extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our armed forces . I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate the Teacher Corps , rent assistance , and home rule for the District of Columbia . In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing , in some cases , as many as 100 , 000 people . Working together , private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops , parks and hospitals , and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life . I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas . Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage , none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air . We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins , making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean , and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people . To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness , I think we must have a stepped up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces . Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets and that right just must be secured . Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways . I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy . We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores . It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention . We must change to master change . I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch , to modernize the relations between city and state and nation . A new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our transportation activities . The present structure 35 government agencies , spending 5 billion yearly makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great nation or the needs of the industry , or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality . I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound in excess of 2 , 000 miles per hour . I propose to examine our federal system the relation between city , state , nation , and the citizens themselves . We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job . I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people . As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly , we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors . Therefore , I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees , bringing local and state committees under the act to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions and to broaden the participation of the people , through added tax incentives , to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice . To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a four year term for Members of the House of Representatives which should not begin before 1972 . The present two year term requires most members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning depriving this nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom . Today , too , the work of government is far more complex than in our early years , requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating . And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life . The nation , the principle of democracy , and , I think , each congressional district , will all be better served by a four year term for members of the House . And I urge your swift action . Tonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam . That conflict is not an isolated episode , but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since World War II . The touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States the welfare and the freedom of the people of the United States . But nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass . In a world that has grown small and dangerous , pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster . An America that is mighty beyond description yet living in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man . In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe . We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey , and we defended the freedom of Berlin . In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence . We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world . And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice . In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam . Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention , but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation . I will discuss them fully in the months to come , and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents . The first principle is strength . Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments . We will need expenditures of 58 . 3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might . While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by 5 . 8 billion , I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire federal budget will rise this coming year by only 0 . 6 billion . This is true because of the stringent cost conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department , and followed by the other departments of government . A second principle of policy is the effort to control , and to reduce , and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction . We will vigorously pursue existing proposals and seek new ones to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons . A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world . By strengthening the common defense , by stimulating world commerce , by meeting new hopes , these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world . We will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for Progress , the unity of Europe , the community of the Atlantic , the regional organizations of developing continents , and that supreme association the United Nations . We will work to strengthen economic cooperation , to reduce barriers to trade , and to improve international finance . A fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man . From the Marshall Plan to this very moment tonight , that policy has rested on the claims of compassion , and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands . This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves . We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance . We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America , in farming and in fertilizers , at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture . We will aid those who educate the young in other lands , and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children . To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966 . I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared for , those suffering in the world , and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade to help countries trying to control population growth , by increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts . In the next year , from our foreign aid sources , we propose to dedicate 1 billion to these efforts , and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world . The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institutions . For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself . We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule . We follow this principle , abroad as well as at home , by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of one race by another . We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe . And I will ask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West . The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of today s world in which we live . In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will . It is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire . In recent months a number of nations have east out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland China . History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people . History does not favor a single system or belief unless force is used to make it so . That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy , to defend it in Berlin , in Korea , in Cuba and tonight in Vietnam . For tonight , as so many nights before , young Americans struggle and young Americans die in a distant land . Tonight , as so many nights before , the American Nation is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom . How many times in my lifetime and in yours have the American people gathered , as they do now , to hear their President tell them of conflict and tell them of danger Each time they have answered . They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this nation required . And they do again tonight in Vietnam . Not too many years ago Vietnam was a peaceful , if troubled , land . In the North was an independent Communist government . In the South a people struggled to build a nation , with the friendly help of the United States . There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people . But their progress was slight . Their hope of success was dim . Then , little more than six years ago , North Vietnam decided on conquest . And from that day to this , soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression . As the assault mounted , our choice gradually became clear . We could leave , abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest , or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam . We stayed . And we will stay until aggression has stopped . We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America s solemn pledge a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American Presidents . We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests , in large measure , on confidence in America s word and in America s protection . To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that confidence , would undermine the independence of many lands , and would whet the appetite of aggression . We would have to fight in one land , and then we would have to fight in another or abandon much of Asia to the domination of Communists . And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest . Last year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again . Swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the South . Attack and terror increased , spurred and encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near . Despite our desire to limit conflict , it was necessary to act to hold back the mounting aggression , to give courage to the people of the South , and to make our firmness clear to the North . Thus . we began limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam . We increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190 , 000 men . These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success . The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of Americans and their allies and by the enduring courage of the South Vietnamese who , I can tell you , have lost eight men last year for every one of ours . The enemy is no longer close to victory . Time is no longer on his side . There is no cause to doubt the American commitment . Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace . In 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam , with friends and adversaries throughout the world . Since Christmas your government has labored again , with imagination and endurance , to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement . For 20 days now we and our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam . Able and experienced spokesmen have visited , in behalf of America , more than 40 countries . We have talked to more than a hundred governments , all 113 that we have relations with , and some that we do not . We have talked to the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace . In public statements and in private communications , to adversaries and to friends , in Rome and Warsaw , in Paris and Tokyo , in Africa and throughout this hemisphere , America has made her position abundantly clear . We seek neither territory nor bases , economic domination or military alliance in Vietnam . We fight for the principle of self determination that the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course , choose it in free elections without violence , without terror , and without fear . The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification . This is all we want for South Vietnam . It is all the people of South Vietnam want . And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people , then let its voice be heard . We have also made it clear from Hanoi to New York that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace . We stand by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962 . We will meet at any conference table , we will discuss any proposals four points or 14 or 40 and we will consider the views of any group . We will work for a cease fire now or once discussions have begun . We will respond if others reduce their use of force , and we will withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future . We have said all this , and we have asked and hoped and we have waited for a response . So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure . We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future , in large measure , is tied to our own action , and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes . We have found understanding and support . And we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace . I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months , but we just cannot know what the future may require . We may have to face long , hard combat or a long , hard conference , or even both at once . Until peace comes , or if it does not come , our course is clear . We will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South Vietnam . We will strive to limit the conflict , for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger . But we will give our fighting men what they must have every gun , and every dollar , and every decision whatever the cost or whatever the challenge . And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle , create progress in the villages , and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war . And let me be absolutely clear The days may become months , and the months may become years , but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle . There may be some who do not want peace , whose ambitions stretch so far that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will . But for others it must now be clear the choice is not between peace and victory , it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose . The people of Vietnam , North and South , seek the same things the shared needs of man , the needs for food and shelter and education the chance to build and work and till the soil , free from the arbitrary horrors of battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny . For many painful years , in war and revolution and infrequent peace , they have struggled to fulfill those needs . It is a crime against mankind that so much courage , and so much will , and so many dreams , must be flung on the fires of war and death . To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight Let us choose peace , and with it the wondrous works of peace , and beyond that , the time when hope reaches toward consummation , and life is the servant of life . In this work , we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve . This is the State of the Union . But over it all wealth , and promise , and expectation lies our troubling awareness of American men at war tonight . How many men who listen to me tonight have served their nation in other wars How very many are not here to listen The war in Vietnam is not like these other wars . Yet , finally , war is always the same . It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise . It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate . Therefore , to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world . Many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me . But there is a difference . For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire , against all the most inward pulls of my desire . For we have children to teach , and we have sick to be cured , and we have men to be freed . There are poor to be lifted up , and there are cities to be built , and there is a world to be helped . Yet we do what we must . I am hopeful , and I will try as best I can , with everything I have got , to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires . Yet as long as others will challenge America s security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel , then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble . I believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk . And from that belief your President summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come . The work must be our work now . Scarred by the weaknesses of man , with whatever guidance God may offer us , we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality , strive to ennoble the life of man on earth . Thank you , and goodnight .<speech_sep>Ladies and gentlemen I wanted very much to be in West Virginia tonight to speak to the American Alumni Council . What the weather has prevented , however , the miracle of electronics has made possible . I am happy to be speaking to you tonight from here in the White House . In a very special way , this is really your house . I have great respect for the work that you do . My own career owes a large debt to men and women like you , who have made it possible for the young people of our country to learn . I know what alumni mean to the support of higher education . Last year alumni contributed almost 300 million to the colleges and universities of this Nation . As the father of two daughters , and as the President of a country in which more than half of our citizens are now under 25 years of age , I think I know how important that assistance is to the youth of this Nation . Throughout my entire life I have taken seriously the warning that the world is engaged in a race between education and chaos . For the last 2 1 2 years I have lived here with the daily awareness that the fate of mankind really depends on the outcome of that race . So I came here tonight because you are committed in the name of education to help us decide that contest . And that is the most important victory we can ever win . We have set out in this country to improve the quality of all American life . We are concerned with each man s opportunity to develop his talents . We are concerned with his environment the cities and the farms where he lives , the air he breathes , the water he drinks . We seek to enrich the schools that educate him and , of course , to improve the governments that serve him . We are at war against the poverty that deprives him , the unemployment that degrades him , and the prejudice that defies him . As we look at other parts of the world , we see similar battles being fought in Asia , in Africa , and in Latin America . On every hand we see the thirst for independence , the struggle for progress the almost frantic race that is taking place between education , on the one hand , and disaster on the other . In all these regions we , too , have a very big stake . And nowhere are the stakes higher than Asia . So I want to talk to you tonight about Asia and about peace in Asia . Asia is now the crucial arena of man s striving for independence and order , and for life itself . This is true because three out of every five people in all this world live in Asia tonight . This is true because hundreds of millions of them exist on less than 25 cents a day . And this is true because Communists in tonight still believe in force in order achieve their Communist goals . So if enduring peace can ever come to Asia , all mankind will benefit . But if peace fails there , nowhere else will our achievements really be secure . By peace in Asia I do not mean simply the absence of armed hostilities . For wherever men hunger and hate there can really be no peace . I do not mean the peace of conquest . For humiliation can be the seedbed of war . I do not mean simply the peace of the conference table . For peace is not really written merely in the words of treaties , but peace is the day by day work of builders . So the peace we seek in Asia is a peace of conciliation between Communist states and their non Communist neighbors between rich nations and poor between small nations and large between men whose skins are brown and black and yellow and white between Hindus and Moslems and Buddhists and Christians . It is a peace that can only be sustained through the durable bonds of peace , and through international trade , and through the free flow of peoples and ideas , and through full participation by all nations in an international community under law , and through a common dedication to the great tasks of human progress and economic development . Is such a peace possible With all my heart I believe that it is . We are not there yet . We have a long way to journey . But the foundations for such a peace in Asia are being laid tonight as never before . They must be built on these essentials First is the determination of the United States to meet our obligations in Asia as a Pacific power . You have heard arguments the other way . They are built on the old belief that East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet that we have no business but business interests in Asia that Europe , not the Far East , is really our proper sphere of interest that our commitments in Asia are not worth the resources that they require that the ocean is vast , the cultures alien , the languages strange , and the races different that these really are not our kind of people . But all of these arguments have been thoroughly tested . And all of them , I think , have really been found wanting . They do not stand the test of geography because we are bounded not by one , but by two oceans . And whether by aircraft or ship , by satellite or missile , the Pacific is as crossable as the Atlantic . They do not stand the test of common sense . The economic network of this shrinking globe is too intertwined , the basic hopes of men are too interrelated , the possibility of common disaster is too real for us to ever ignore threats to peace in Asia . They do not stand the test of human concern , either . The people of Asia do matter . We share with them many things in common . We are all persons . We are all human beings . And they do not stand the test of reality , either . Asia is no longer sitting outside the door of the 20th century . She is here in the same world with all of us to be either our partner or our problem . Americans entered this century believing that our own security had no foundation outside our own continent . Twice we mistook our sheltered position for safety . Twice we were dead wrong . And if we are wise now , we will not repeat our mistakes of the past . We will not retreat from the obligations of freedom and security in Asia . The second essential for peace in Asia is this to prove to aggressive nations that the use of force to conquer others is really a losing game . There is no more difficult task , really , in a world of revolutionary change where the rewards of conquest tempt ambitious appetites . As long as the leaders of North Vietnam really believe that they can take over the people of South Vietnam by force , we just must not let them succeed . We must stand across their path and say You will not prevail but turn from the use of force and peace will follow . Every American must know exactly what it is that we are trying to do in Vietnam . Our greatest resource , really , in this conflict our greatest support for the men who are fighting out there is your understanding . It is your willingness to carry , perhaps for a long time , the heavy burden of a confusing and costly war . We are not trying to wipe out North Vietnam . We are not trying to change their government . We are not trying to establish permanent bases in South Vietnam . And we are not trying to gain one inch of new territory for America . Then , you say , Why are we there Why Well , we are there because we are trying to make the Communists of North Vietnam stop shooting at their neighbors because we are trying to make this Communist aggression unprofitable because we are trying to demonstrate that guerrilla warfare , inspired by one nation against another nation , just can never succeed . Once that lesson is learned , a shadow that hangs over all of Asia tonight will , I think , begin to recede . Well , you say , when will that day come I am sorry , I cannot tell you . Only the men in Hanoi can give you that answer . We are fighting a war of determination . It may last a long time . But we must keep on until the Communists in North Vietnam realize the price of aggression is too high and either agree to a peaceful settlement or to stop their fighting . However long it takes , I want the Communists in Hanoi to know where we stand . First , victory for your armies is impossible . You cannot drive us from South Vietnam by your force . Do not mistake our firm stand for false optimism . As long as you persist in aggression , we are going to resist . Second , the minute you realize that a military victory is out of the question and you turn from the use of force , you will find us ready and willing to reciprocate . We want to end the fighting . We want to bring our men back home . We want an honorable peace in Vietnam . In your hands is the key to that peace . You have only to turn it . The third essential is the building of political and economic strength among the nations of free Asia . For years they have been working at that task . And the untold story of 1966 is the story of what free Asians have done for themselves , and with the help of others , while South Vietnam and her allies have been busy holding aggression at bay . Many of you can recall our faith in the future of Europe at the end of World War II when we began the Marshall plan . We backed that faith with all the aid and compassion we could muster . Well , our faith in Asia tonight is just as great . And that faith is backed by judgment and by reason . For if we stand firm in Vietnam against military conquest , we truly believe that the emerging order of hope and progress in Asia will continue to grow and to grow . Our very able Secretary of State , Dean Rusk , has just returned from a trip through the Far East . He told me yesterday afternoon of many of the heartening signs he saw as the people of Asia continue to work toward common goals . And these are just some of them . In the last year Japan and Korea have settled their long standing disputes and established normal relations with promise for a closer cooperation One country after another has achieved rates of economic growth that are far beyond the most optimistic hopes we had a few years ago Indonesia and its more than 100 million people have already pulled back from the brink of communism and economic collapse Our friends in India and Pakistan 600 million strong have ended a tragic conflict and have returned to the immense work of peace Japan has become a dramatic example of economic progress through political and social freedom and has begun to help others Communist China s policy of aggression by proxy is failing Nine Pacific nations allies and neutrals , white and colored came together on their own initiative to form an Asian and Pacific Council New and constructive groupings for economic cooperation are under discussion in Southeast Asia The billion dollar Asian Development Bank which I first mentioned in Baltimore in my televised speech a few months ago is already moving forward in Manila with the participation of more than 31 nations And the development of the Lower Mekong River Basin is going forward despite the war . Throughout free Asia you can hear the echo of progress . As one Malaysian leader said Whatever our ethical , cultural , or religious backgrounds , the nations and peoples of Southeast Asia must pull together in the same broad sweep of history . We must create with our own hands and minds a new perspective and a new framework . And we must do it ourselves . For this is the new Asia , and this is the new spirit we see taking shape behind our defense of South Vietnam . Because we have been firm because we have committed ourselves to the defense of one small country other countries have taken new heart . And I want to assure them tonight that we never intend to let you down . America s word will always be good . There is a fourth essential for peace in Asia which may seem the most difficult of all reconciliation between nations that now call themselves enemies . A peaceful mainland China is central to a peaceful Asia . A hostile China must be discouraged from aggression . A misguided China must be encouraged toward understanding of the outside world and toward policies of peaceful cooperation . For lasting peace can never come to Asia as long as the 700 million people of mainland China are isolated by their rulers from the outside world . We have learned in our relations with other such states that the weakness of neighbors is a temptation , and only firmness that is backed by power can really deter power that is backed by ambition . But we have also learned that the greatest force for opening closed minds and opening closed societies is the free flow of ideas and people and goods . For many years , now , the United States has attempted in vain to persuade the Chinese Communists to agree to an exchange of newsmen as one of the first steps to increased understanding between our people . More recently , we have taken steps to permit American scholars , experts in medicine and public health , and other specialists to travel to Communist China . And only today we , here in the Government , cleared a passport for a leading American businessman to exchange knowledge with Chinese mainland leaders in Red China . All of these initiatives , except the action today , have been rejected by Communist China . We persist because we know that hunger and disease , ignorance and poverty , recognize no boundaries of either creed or class or country . We persist because we believe that even the most rigid societies will some day , one day awaken to the rich possibilities of a diverse world . And we continue because we believe that cooperation , not hostility , is really the way of the future in the 20th century . That day is not yet here . It may be long in coming , but I tell you it is clearly on its way , because come it must . Earlier this year the Foreign Minister of Singapore said that if the nations of the world could learn to build a truly world civilization in the Pacific through cooperation and peaceful competition , then as our great President Theodore Roosevelt once remarked this may be the greatest of all human eras the Pacific era . As a Pacific power we must help achieve that outcome . Because it is a goal that is worthy of our American dreams and it is a goal that is worthy of the deeds of our brave men who are dying for us tonight . So I say to you and I pledge to all those who are counting on us You can depend upon us , because all Americans will do our part .<speech_sep>Webb , Dryden , Seamans , my fellow Americans Monday was a very happy day for you and for the Nation , but this opportunity to visit with all the members of America s space team is no anticlimax for me . So , to each of you who contributed to the success of America s most historic peacetime adventure , I am proud and I am privileged to say to each and to all of you Well done . The television commentators and the newspaper writers have all had a good bit to say about the sterling qualities and virtues of Major McDivitt and Major White . Of course , I have detected a certain greater objectivity in the remarks made publicly by both of their lovely wives . Be that as it may , what impresses and gratifies me most about these two heroes and all of the other astronauts is the quality of personal modesty and humility . I have not yet met a man who has not come down from space wanting to give more credit to all the men and women on the ground than he would accept for himself up there . Ed and Jim are no exceptions . I invited them to bring their families to the ranch tomorrow , or the next day , because I wanted to present both of them with a token of their country s great esteem and respect . But I learned last night from the Administrator , Webb , that both men felt a ceremony at the ranch would focus too much credit on them and exclude all of you who supported their flight here so impressively at this new NASA Spacecenter in Houston . So , we have arranged our plans gladly to come here with one proviso . A little later , next week or the early part of the following week , we expect to see the McDivitts and their three children , and the Whites and their two children , and the manager of the Gemini program , Mathews and his family , in Washington at the White House . At that time we are going to pay them the honor all of you know they deserve , no matter what they say about it . But today , as I said to you when we were talking a few hours ago , I promised to bring these two heroes a little token . Well , I am going to keep my promise . I am nominating Major McDivitt and Major White for promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel for their spectacular achievements on behalf of all the people of their country and the free world . And I am saying , also , that that is something you can eat as well as wear . Incidentally , I might announce today that Maj . Gordon Cooper will be promoted on July 15th to the rank of lieutenant colonel . And I am not going to forget the fourth Air Force astronaut to make an orbital flight , so I complete my announcement today by nominating Maj . Gus Grissom for promotion to lieutenant colonel , also . When our manned space program began , many said about space what men probably said 500 years before about America itself that the environment was hostile , that the climate was no good , that there was nothing there worth the trip anyway . These two young Americans have changed that conception forever . All people have a new sense of thrill , and excitement , and anticipation about space exploration because of the flight of Gemini 4 . The joy and the thrill and the exhilaration that Ed White experienced on his walk from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic ran through the veins of us all . Our attitudes about space will never entirely be the same again . And let me make one other observation . I read with mixed emotions yesterday that Major White had decided to claim this State of his birth as his home State . Well , as President , I am supposed to be neutral on matters of State pride , but the glimmer of pride I allow myself to feel is subdued just a bit . I know some will say that as soon as Americans got themselves up into space a Texan had to go and put his foot in it . Seriously , I hope that the clear and obvious meaning and promise of this great adventure , which all of you have really shared , will not be lost upon mankind . Only a few years ago , this great Nation was unmistakably behind in space . Abroad and at home some prophesied that America would remain behind , that our system had failed , that the brightness of our future had dimmed and would grow darker . But no such prophecies are heard today . Proceeding openly openly admitting our failures , openly sharing and offering to share our successes the United States of America has proceeded with the determination and the zeal that burns in the hearts of men who love liberty . And , today , we know that America s success is very great indeed . All that we have accomplished in space all that we may accomplish in days and years to come we stand ready to share for the benefit of all mankind . Whether we stand first in these endeavors matters to our momentary pride but not to our continuing and permanent purpose . The race in which we of this generation are determined to be first is the race for peace in the world . In the labors of peace as in the explorations of space let no man in any land doubt for a moment that we have the will , and the determination , and the talent , and the resources required to stay the course and see those labors through . So , I would end this week as I began it last Sunday morning , saying to all nations and all peoples , East and West , that we of America a strong , a confident , a proud , and a peaceful America invite you to open your curtains , come through the doorways and the walls that you have built , and join with us to walk together toward peace for all people on this earth . Thank you . Thank you , Colonel McDivitt , and thank you , Colonel White . I just want to say this , before I look at your Center , that I conducted the first investigations in the space field as a Member of the Senate . And as I looked out over this group today and this great installation that just did not exist those few years ago , I thought of what Jim Webb and Dryden had said 4 years ago , or more , when they left my office the first day they were to undertake this assignment . I saw Seamans and Gilruth here today and all of the thousands of people who have participated in this great adventure . You do not know the gratitude I feel to each of you and how proud I am of all of you . Thank you .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Members of the Congress I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy . I urge every member of both parties , Americans of all religions and of all colors , from every section of this country , to join me in that cause . At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man s unending search for freedom . So it was at Lexington and Concord . So it was a century ago at Appomattox . So it was last week in Selma , Alabama . There , long suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans . Many were brutally assaulted . One good man , a man of God , was killed . There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma . There is no cause for self satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans . But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight . For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great Government the Government of the greatest Nation on earth . Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country to right wrong , to do justice , to serve man . In our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis . Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues issues of war and peace , issues of prosperity and depression . But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself . Rarely are we met with a challenge , not to our growth or abundance , our welfare or our security , but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved Nation . The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue . And should we defeat every enemy , should we double our wealth and conquer the stars , and still be unequal to this issue , then we will have failed as a people and as a nation . For with a country as with a person , What is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul There is no Negro problem . There is no Southern problem . There is no Northern problem . There is only an American problem . And we are met here tonight as Americans not as Democrats or Republicans we are met here as Americans to solve that problem . This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose . The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart , North and South All men are created equal government by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death . Well , those are not just clever words , or those are not just empty theories . In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries , and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty , risking their lives . Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man . This dignity cannot be found in a man s possessions it cannot be found in his power , or in his position . It really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others . It says that he shall share in freedom , he shall choose his leaders , educate his children , and provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being . To apply any other test to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race , his religion or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice , it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom . Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish , it must be rooted in democracy . The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders . The history of this country , in large measure , is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people . Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult . But about this there can and should be no argument . Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote . There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right . There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right . Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes . Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right . The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong , or the hour is late , or the official in charge is absent . And if he persists , and if he manages to present himself to the registrar , he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application . And if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test . The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test . He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution , or explain the most complex provisions of State law . And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write . For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin . Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination . No law that we now have on the books and I have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it . In such a case our duty must be clear to all of us . The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color . We have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution . We must now act in obedience to that oath . Wednesday I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote . The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders tomorrow . After they have reviewed it , it will come here formally as a bill . I am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends , to give them my views , and to visit with my former colleagues . I have had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which I will submit to the clerks tonight . But I want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation . This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections federal , state , and local which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote . This bill will establish a simple , uniform standard which cannot be used , however ingenious the effort , to flout our Constitution . It will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the United States Government if the State officials refuse to register them . It will eliminate tedious , unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote . Finally , this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting . I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress I have no doubt that I will get some on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective . But experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the Constitution . To those who seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections , the answer is simple Open your polling places to all your people . Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin . Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land . There is no constitutional issue here . The command of the Constitution is plain . There is no moral issue . It is wrong deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country . There is no issue of States rights or national rights . There is only the struggle for human rights . I have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer . The last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections . That civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate . And when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature , the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated . This time , on this issue , there must be no delay , no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose . We cannot , we must not , refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in . And we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another 8 months before we get a bill . We have already waited a hundred years and more , and the time for waiting is gone . So I ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends , if necessary to pass this bill . And I do not make that request lightly . For from the window where I sit with the problems of our country I recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation , the grave concern of many nations , and the harsh judgment of history on our acts . But even if we pass this bill , the battle will not be over . What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America . It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life . Their cause must be our cause too . Because it is not just Negroes , but really it is all of us , who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice . And we shall overcome . As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil , I know how agonizing racial feelings are . I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society . But a century has passed , more than a hundred years , since the Negro was freed . And he is not fully free tonight . It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln , a great President of another party , signed the Emancipation Proclamation , but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact . A century has passed , more than a hundred years , since equality was promised . And yet the Negro is not equal . A century has passed since the day of promise . And the promise is unkept . The time of justice has now come . I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back . It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come . And when it does , I think that day will brighten the lives of every American . For Negroes are not the only victims . How many white children have gone uneducated , how many white families have lived in stark poverty , how many white lives have been scarred by fear , because we have wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror So I say to all of you here , and to all in the Nation tonight , that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future . This great , rich , restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all black and white , North and South , sharecropper and city dweller . These are the enemies poverty , ignorance , disease . They are the enemies and not our fellow man , not our neighbor . And these enemies too , poverty , disease and ignorance , we shall overcome . Now let none of us in any sections look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section , or on the problems of our neighbors . There is really no part of America where the promise of equality has been fully kept . In Buffalo as well as in Birmingham , in Philadelphia as well as in Selma , Americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom . This is one Nation . What happens in Selma or in Cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every American . But let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities , and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists . As we meet here in this peaceful , historic chamber tonight , men from the South , some of whom were at Iwo Jima , men from the North who have carried Old Glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it , men from the East and from the West , are all fighting together without regard to religion , or color , or region , in Viet Nam . Men from every region fought for us across the world 20 years ago . And in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the South made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great Republic and in some instances , a great many of them , more . And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country , from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico , from the Golden Gate to the harbors along the Atlantic , will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all Americans . For all of us owe this duty and I believe that all of us will respond to it . Your President makes that request of every American . The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro . His actions and protests , his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life , have awakened the conscience of this Nation . His demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice , designed to provoke change , designed to stir reform . He has called upon us to make good the promise of America . And who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery , and his faith in American democracy . For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated belief in the democratic process . Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but upon the force of moral right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order . There have been many pressures upon your President and there will be others as the days come and go . But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought in the courts , and in the Congress , and in the hearts of men . We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly . But the right of free speech does not carry with it , as has been said , the right to holler fire in a crowded theater . We must preserve the right to free assembly , but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic . We do have a right to protest , and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors . And I intend to protect all those rights as long as I am permitted to serve in this office . We will guard against violence , knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek progress , obedience to law , and belief in American values . In Selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace . We seek order . We seek unity . But we will not accept the peace of stifled rights , or the order imposed by fear , or the unity that stifles protest . For peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty . In Selma tonight , as in every and we had a good day there as inevery city , we are working for just and peaceful settlement . We must all remember that after this speech I am making tonight , after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone , and after you have promptly passed this bill , the people of Selma and the other cities of the Nation must still live and work together . And when the attention of the Nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community . This cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence , as the history of the South itself shows . It is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days last Tuesday , again today . The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill . But , in a larger sense , most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program . Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races . Because all Americans just must have the right to vote . And we are going to give them that right . All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race . And they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race . But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right . It requires a trained mind and a healthy body . It requires a decent home , and the chance to find a job , and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty . Of course , people cannot contribute to the Nation if they are never taught to read or write , if their bodies are stunted from hunger , if their sickness goes untended , if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check . So we want to open the gates to opportunity . But we are alsogoing to give all our people , black and white , the help that they need to walkthrough those gates . My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla , Texas , in a small Mexican American school . Few of them could speak English , and I could not speak much Spanish . My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast , hungry . They knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice . They never seemed to know why people disliked them . But they knew it was so , because I saw it in their eyes . I often walked home late in the afternoon , after the classes were finished , wishing there was more that I could do . But all I knew was to teach them the little that I knew , hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead . Somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child . I never thought then , in 1928 , that I would be standing here in 1965 . It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country . But now I do have that chance and I will let you in on a secret I mean to use it . And I hope that you will use it with me . This is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe . The might of past empires is little compared to ours . But I do not want to be the President who built empires , or sought grandeur , or extended dominion . I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world . I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of tax eaters . I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election . I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties . I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth . And so at the request of your beloved Speaker and the Senator from Montana the majority leader , the Senator from Illinois the minority leader , McCulloch , and other Members of both parties , I came here tonight not as President Roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill , not as President Truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but I came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for . I want this to be the Congress , Republicans and Democrats alike , which did all these things for all these people . Beyond this great chamber , out yonder in 50 States , are the people that we serve . Who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen . We all can guess , from our own lives , how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness , how many problems each little family has . They look most of all to themselves for their futures . But I think that they also look to each of us . Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says in Latin God has favored our undertaking . God will not favor everything that we do . It is rather our duty to divine His will . But I cannot help believing that He truly understands and that He really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight .<speech_sep>Secretary , ladies and gentlemen I am very pleased to address the Foreign Service Institute this morning and to come here to meet with so many Americans that are preparing to serve their country abroad . As one who believes that we cannot shorten our reach in the world , I am greatly encouraged by the number and the quality of those who are studying at this Institute . You have the gratitude of your countrymen and my own assurance of support . We have come a long way from the day that someone observed that some diplomat no doubt will launch a heedless word and lurking war leap out . That was more than half a century ago when diplomacy was often war by another name . Today your task is different . Those of you about to go abroad represent a continuity of purpose in a generation of change . That purpose is to build from reason and moderation a world order in which the fires of conflict yield to the fulfillment of man s oldest yearnings for himself and his family . Your job , wherever you serve , is peace . That is the task that faces all of us today . The question , as always , is how How do we , for example , maintain the security of the Atlantic community upon which so many of the world s hopes depend For the answer , we must begin with the gray dawn of the world of 1945 , when Europe s cities lay in rubble , her farms devastated , her industries smashed , her people weary with war and death and defeat . Now from that desolation has come abundance . From that weakness has come power . From those ashes of holocaust has come the rebirth of a strong and a vital community . The Europe of today is a new Europe . In place of uncertainty there is confidence in place of decay , progress in place of isolation , partnership in place of war , peace . If there is no single explanation for the difference between Europe then and Europe now , there is a pattern . It is a luminous design that is woven through the history of the past 20 years . It is the design of common action , of interdependent institutions serving the good of the European nations as though they were all one . It is the design of collective security protecting the entire Atlantic community . So I have come here this morning to speak to you of one important part of that design . I speak of a structure that some of you have helped to build the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Let me make clear in the beginning that we do not believe there is any righteousness in standing pat . If an organization is alive and vital , if it is to have meaning for all time as well as for any particular time , it must grow and respond and yield to change . Like our Constitution , which makes the law of the land , the North Atlantic Treaty is more than just a legal document . It is the foundation of a living institution . That institution is NATthe organization created to give meaning and reality to the alliance commitments . The crowded months which immediately preceded and followed the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty 17 years ago had produced an atmosphere of crisis . It was a crisis that was born of deep fear fear for Europe s economic and political vitality , fear of Communist aggression , fear of Communist subversion . Some say that new circumstances in the world today call for the dismantling of this great organization . Of course NATO should adapt to the changing needs of the times , but we believe just as firmly that such change must be wrought by the member nations working with one another within the alliance . Consultation , not isolation , is the route to reform . We must not forget either in success or abundance the lessons that we have learned in danger and in isolation that whatever the issue that we share , we have one common danger division and one common safety unity . What is our view of NATO today We see it not as an alliance to make war , but as an alliance to keep peace . Through an era as turbulent as man has ever known , and under the constant threat of ultimate destruction , NATO has insured the security of the North Atlantic community . It has reinforced stability elsewhere throughout the world . While NATO rests on the reality that we must fight together if war should come to the Atlantic area , it rests also on the reality that war will not come if we act together during peace . It was the Foreign Minister of France who , in 1949 , insisted that to be truly secure , Europe needed not only help in resisting attack , but help in preventing attack . Liberation , he said , is not enough . The success of NATO has been measured by many yardsticks . The most significant , to me , is the most obvious War has been deterred . Through the common organization , we have welded the military contributions of each of the 15 allies into a very effective instrument . So convincing was this instrument that potential aggressors took stock and counted as too high the price of satisfying their ambitions . It has been proved true that one sword keeps another in the sheath . War has been deterred not only because of our integrated military power , but because of the political unity of purpose to which that power has been directed and bent . It is difficult to overstate the importance of the bonds of culture , of political institutions , traditions , and values which form the bedrock of the Atlantic community . There is here a political integrity and an identity of interests that transcends personalities and issues of the moment . If our collective effort should falter and our common determination be eroded , the foundation of the Atlantic s present stability would certainly be shaken . The mightiest arsenal in the world will deter no aggressor who knows that his victims are too divided to decide and too unready to respond . That was the lesson that we learned from two world wars . Yet a nation not by the action of her friends , but by her own decision to prepare and plan alone could still imperil her own security by creating a situation in which response would be too late and too diluted . Every advance in the technology of war makes more unacceptable the old and narrow concepts of sovereignty . No one today can doubt the necessity of preventing war . It is our firm conviction that collective action through NATO is the best assurance that war will be deterred in the Atlantic world . Look at the Atlantic community through the eyes of those who in years past have yearned for conquest . The sight is sobering . Integrated commands , common plans , forces in being in advance of an emergency for use in any emergency all of these testify to a collective readiness and the integrity of collective purposes . To other eyes , NATO can only be a clear warning of the folly of aggression . NATO today , therefore , must be shaped on the experience of the past . Reliance on independent action by separate forces only loosely coordinated with joint forces and plans twice led to world wars before 1945 . But collective action has proved successful in deterring war since 1945 during 20 years of upheaval and grave danger . We reject those experiences only at our own peril . For our part , the United States of America is determined to join with 13 of her other allies to preserve and to strengthen the deterrent strength of NATWe will urge that those principles of joint and common preparation be extended wherever they can be usefully applied in the Atlantic Alliance . We are hopeful that no member of the treaty will long remain withdrawn from the mutual affairs and obligations of the Atlantic . A place of respect and responsibility will await any ally who decides to return to the common task . For the world is still full of peril for those who prize and cherish liberty peril and opportunity . These bountiful lands that are washed by the Atlantic , this half billion people that are unmatched in arms and industry , this cradle of common values and splendid visions , this measureless storehouse of wealth , can enrich the life of an entire planet . It is this strength of ideas as well as strength of arms , of peaceful purpose as well as power that offers such hope for the reconciliation of Western Europe with the people of Eastern Europe . To surrender that strength now by isolation from one another would be to dim the promise of that day when the men and women of all Europe shall again move freely among each other . It is not a question of wealth alone . It is a question of heart and mind . It is a willingness to leave forever those national rivalries which so often led to the useless squandering of lives and treasure in war . It is a question of the deeper spirit of unity of which NATO is but a symbol . That unity was never better expressed than when , at the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949 , a great French leader declared that nations are more and more convinced that their fates are closely bound together that their salvation and their welfare must rest upon the progressive application of human solidarity . And it is to the preservation of human solidarity that all of our efforts today should be directed . So let all of you of the Foreign Service Institute make it your task , as well as mine . Thank you and good morning .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge will be leaving tomorrow evening for Saigon . When they return next week , we will give careful consideration to their recommendations , as well as those of Ambassador Taylor and General Westmoreland . And we will do what is necessary . The present center of the struggle is in South Viet Nam , but its root cause is a determined effort of conquest that is directed from Hanoi . Heavy infiltration of North Vietnamese forces has created new dangers and difficulties in South Viet Nam . Increased aggression from the North may require an increased American response on the ground in South Viet Nam . Increased aggression from the North continues to require very careful replies against selected military targets in North Viet Nam . Meanwhile , General Westmoreland has the authority to use the American forces that are now in Viet Nam in the ways which he considers most effective to resist the Communist aggression and the terror that is taking . place there . These forces will defend their own bases . They will assist in providing security in neighboring areas , and they will be available for more active combat missions when the Vietnamese Government and General Westmoreland agree that such active missions are needed . So it is quite possible that new and serious decisions will be necessary in the near future . Any substantial increase in the present level of our efforts to turn back the aggressors in South Viet Nam will require steps to insure that our reserves of men and equipment of the United States remain entirely adequate for any and all emergencies . Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge will concern themselves also with the political and economic situation . We have had Eugene Black visiting southeast Asia and he has given me an oral report on his encouraging visit to that area . We mean to make it plain that our military effort is only a necessary preliminary to the larger purpose of peace and progress . In the Dominican Republic , Ambassador Bunker and his colleagues are continuing their skillful and determined effort to find a peaceful solution . We believe , as they do , that it is urgent that a solution bc found , and found promptly . We are encouraged by indications that leaders on both sides are prepared to stand aside in favor of a new government which will enjoy the confidence of the Dominican people as a whole . Those on both sides who show good will and those who join a new government in the work of restoring peace will deserve the thanks of all of their countrymen . Right now , here , we are both cautious and hopeful . I am very pleased to announce today that I am nominating Judge Thurgood Marshall to be Solicitor General of the United States . He will succeed the Honorable Archibald Cox , who is retiring after more than four years of distinguished service to return to Massachusetts . The Solicitor General directs all Government litigation before the Supreme Court of the United States and the other appellate courts . Judge Marshall brings to that significant job an outstanding record of legal and judicial experience . He has served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit since 1962 , and at very considerable financial sacrifice is resigning in order to meet the needs of his Government . For a quarter of a century before his appointment to the bench , Judge Marshall was the leading legal champion of equal rights under the law , appearing before the Supreme Court more than 30 times . His vast experience in the Federal courts , and especially in the Supreme Court , has gained Judge Marshall a reputation as one of the most distinguished advocates in the Nation . I know him to be a lawyer and a judge of very high ability , a patriot of deep convictions , and a gentleman of undisputed integrity . So it is an honor to appoint him as the 33d Solicitor General of the United States . He is here this afternoon and I would like to ask him to stand . Judge Marshall . I intend to nominate Leonard Marks of Washington , C . , to be the Director of the United States Information Service , succeeding the Honorable Carl Rowan . Marks has an excellent record as a teacher , as a lawyer , and as a Government servant . President Kennedy appointed him to be an original member of the board of directors of the Communications Satellite Corporation in 1962 . Since that time he has been reappointed . Marks , who has had a long interest in international communications , has represented the United States at broadcasting conferences and activities in Italy , India , Pakistan , Switzerland , Afghanistan , Turkey , and Iran . Phillips Talbot , the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs , will be nominated as United States Ambassador to Greece . He will succeed Henry Labouisse , who is Executive Director of the United Nations Children s Fund . A most experienced Foreign Service Officer , the Honorable Raymond Hare , who is presently Ambassador to Turkey , will succeed him in his post as Assistant Secretary of State . Ambassador Hare has been in the Foreign Service since 1927 . He has served in France , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Lebanon , the United Arab Republic , and Yemen . I have asked Penelope Hartland Thunberg of Maryland to become a member of the United States Tariff Commission . She will serve in the position last held by Commissioner Walter Schreiber for a term expiring June 16 , 1970 . Thunberg is an international economist presently serving as Deputy Chief of the International Division , Economic and Research Area , Central Intelligence Agency . She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Pembroke College and holds the and Ph . degrees from Radcliffe College . She is here this afternoon and I would like for you to meet her . Please stand up . Yesterday the Soviet Government notified the United States Government that it is agreeable to the resumption of negotiations of the 18 nation Disarmament Committee at Geneva . The United States has suggested a date no later than July 27th for this resumption . William Foster now is in the process of inquiring whether this date is agreeable to the other 16 members of the Disarmament Committee . At the conclusion of the Geneva conference last September , it was agreed that the two cochairmen , the Soviet Union and the United States , would consult and would agree on a date for resumption , after which the other members of the Committee would be consulted in order to obtain their agreement as well . Foster met with the Soviet spokesman in New York on June 15th on instructions to urge reconvening of the Disarmament Committee as soon as possible . Yesterday s Soviet response is an encouraging development . As we have stated before , peace is the leading item on the agenda of mankind , and every effort should be made to lead us toward that goal . As I stated in San Francisco , we will come to these next negotiations with proposals for effective attack on these deadly dangers to mankind , and we hope that others will do the same . Now I am prepared to take your questions . The Government is always considering every possibility and every eventuality . No decisions have been made in connection with the Reserve or increasing draft calls . We will be in a better position to act upon matters of that kind after the Secretary returns from his trip . I think that the Governor has best explained that trip himself by saying it is a vacation . That is on the wires today . It is not an official Government trip . He was not sent there by the President , although the Governor is a man of a wide range of interests and experience . I approved heartily of his statement that he would be glad to visit with any people that cared to visit with him . It is a personal trip , and a vacation trip in nature . I do not think that anyone can prophesy what will happen from day to day , or week to week , or month to month . I think it is well for us to remember that three Presidents have made the pledge for this Nation , that the Senate has ratified the SEATO treaty by a vote of 82 to pledging the United States to come to the aid of any nation , upon their request , who are parties to that treaty or protocol . President Eisenhower made our first commitment there in 1954 . That was reaffirmed by President Kennedy many times in different ways . The present President has reiterated the stand of the United States that we expect to keep that commitment . Our national honor is at stake . Our word is at stake . And it must be obvious to all Americans that they would not want the President of their country to follow any course that was inconsistent with our commitments or with our national honor . So far as I am aware , the situation there has no effect on the merger one way or the other . It is contended that the merger would improve the efficiency , but I do not think that it is a matter that would be considered in connection with what happens out there , one way or the other . No , I am not in a position to make a statement on that at this time . The Space Council has had some briefings in connection with the matter . There is a study going on every day in that connection , but I would not want to go further than that now . We are very anxious to maintain close relations with the Soviet Union , and we had felt that considerable progress had been made in the last several years . Unfortunately , the situation that developed in North Viet Nam has placed a strain on those relations . We regret it very deeply , but we have felt that , as I said earlier , our national honor required us to pursue the course of conduct that we have followed . We will be looking for every opportunity that we can to work with the Soviet Union in the interest of peace . We think that the resumption of the Disarmament Conference is one step in that direction . We would like to improve the relations any way we can . As I said in my opening statement , the aggression has increased . The forces that are pursuing that aggression have greatly increased in number . It will be necessary to resist that aggression and , therefore , to have substantially larger increments of troops which we have been supplying from time to time . I do not think that anyone can tell at this date any special figure that will be required , but I think that following Ambassador Lodge and Secretary McNamara s trip we will have a better estimate of what the rest of the year will hold for us . We would hope that if the North Vietnamese would cease their aggression we could immediately take steps to have the people of South Viet Nam exercise their choice and establish a government of their choosing . We , of course , would hope that that would be a very efficient and effective and democratic system . Yes , we will constantly be on the alert to probe , and to be ready and willing to negotiate with the appropriate people . I must say that candor compels me to tell you that there has not been the slightest indication that the other side is interested in negotiation or in unconditional discussions , although the United States has made some dozen separate attempts to bring that about . I think that the press and the Congress and the people of the United States have , generally speaking , with very minor exceptions , given me during the time I have been President very strong support and very excellent cooperation . I know that there are some in each segment that have been disappointed in some of my decisions and some of my actions . I like to think that those who talk about them the most see us the least , and so far as I am concerned , I have no criticism to make of any other people in helping me do my job . We have a very fine Cabinet . Nearly every person I have asked to come and help the Government has done so . I think that there are very few Presidents in the history of this country that have had more support of more publishers and more magazines than the present President . I am grateful for that , although I recognize it is an essential part of their duty to point up weaknesses that they think exist . I have seen that take place for some 35 years , and as long as they point them out , in the manner in which they are pointing them out , and the people continue to support us , and the Congress continues to support us , I am not going to find any fault with them . During the period that we have had the most hectic , distressing moments here in Washington , the poll has gone up 6 percent out in the country , so I sometimes think maybe it just may be July in the Nation s Capital . Yes , I have taken a position since making my recommendations to the Congress early in the year , that I would like to see the poll tax repealed . I am against the poll tax . I have tried to get it repealed every time that I have had a chance , when I thought we could do it legally . I have asked the Attorney General to attempt to work with the conferees of both House and Senate to see if they cannot agree on satisfactory language that will give us the most effective repeal provision that is obtainable and that we think can be supported in the courts . I have no doubt but what a very satisfactory solution will be found . And I think that would be quite desirable . No . The Deputy Director is now being handled by a very able man with experience who will be there for a while yet . I am sure that after Marks reviews the organizations and talks to the present Deputy Director and the present Director , Rowan , he will come up with some suggestions and recommendations . I believe that they will be acceptable . I did not single out anyone . We had had several days debate about the relative merits of two proposals . It had been observed that the administration proposal was dripping in venom and was inadequate and went too far , and a good many things had been said about it . Finally , when it was put as a test to the judgment of the House and they made their decision , I commended that decision and said that I believed that they were wise in acting as they had . Because had they adopted the so called Ford or McCulloch substitute for the committee bill , as advocated by Judge Howard Smith and Governor Tuck and others , I was of the opinion it would have diluted and taken strength from the bill that they had passed . I am very proud of the action of the House . I am very proud of the judgment they exercised in that connection . But people are allowed to comment on the relative merits of legislation either before or after a vote , and I found there have been a good many comments on my proposals . I thought it would be appropriate if I carefully limited myself to an observation that the substitute would have diluted the right of every American to vote . I think all of us are aware of the fact that in years gone by we could have done much more than we have in that field . I have become very conscious of that as I have traveled over this Nation and talked to our people . I think the House acted wisely , and I have every confidence in the action that will follow the conference report . I ask the cooperation of members of both parties . I do not think the substitute was as effective as the bill that was adopted . And I would not like to see us return to it . Yes , I think that all of us realize at this stage of the 20th century there is much that should have been done that has not been done . This bill is not going to solve the problem completely itself . There will be much to be done in the years ahead . I think the problem of the American Negro is one of the two or three most important problems that we must face up to with our legislation again next year . I am particularly sensitive to the problems of the Negro and the problems of the city and the problems which the shift in population has caused , the problems of education . I have task forces working on those things . And perhaps it is because I realize , after traveling through 44 States and after reading some 20 , 000 or 30 , 000 letters a week , digests from them , that it is a very acute problem and one that I want to do my best to solve in the . limited time that I am allowed . I did not have that responsibility in the years past , and I did not feel it to the extent that I do today . I hope that you may understand that I think it is an acute one and a dangerous one , and one that occupies high priority and one that should challenge every American of whatever party , whatever religion . I am going to try to provide all the leadership that I can , notwithstanding the fact that someone may point to a mistake or 100 mistakes that I made in my past . Peter , I do not think that we can tell the extent of that agreement and how far it will reach . They gave no figures . They did not explain what materials they were going to supply . We have known for some time now that they are furnishing equipment and they are furnishing supplies and they are making contributions of aid in one form or the other to North Viet Nam this is no surprise to us at all . I read the very general announcement that they had made . There is nothing that I could detect from it , or that our experts could detect , that would give me any more information than contained in the announcement . No , I do not think that the teach ins and the differences of opinion have increased the strength of the North Vietnamese or the aggression that has taken place . I do think that at times our allies , particularly the South Vietnamese people , and particularly our own soldiers , do get concerned about how strong we are behind them and how united we are in this very serious undertaking . But I am glad to say that I do not think it has had any serious or damaging effect there . I get several letters a day from soldiers in Viet Nam , service people , the Navy , Marines , Army , and Air . I hear from their parents . And I have yet to receive a single complaining letter . On occasions they wish that the folks back home , who are following this with such dedicated interest , understood the position as they feel they understand it . But I do not think it has damaged our effort out there and I do not think it will . I think we will be united in this effort . There will be some differences of opinion about the wisdom of some courses that the President takes , the Executive takes , but whenever and wherever we can , we will try to explain those to the people involved and at least try to get their understanding . None whatever . And I think you do a great damage and a great disservice to one of the most able and most competent and most dedicated men that I have ever known , Secretary Rusk . He sits to my right in the Cabinet room . He ranks first in the Cabinet and he ranks first with me . I would not want to get into a dispute with my friends who have written these memorandums . I do not see anything to be gained by that . The President asked me , on his own motion , to go on the ticket with him , and I gave him my reasons for hesitating . He told me he would speak to Speaker Rayburn and others , and he did . Subsequently , he called me and said , Here s a statement I am going to read on television , unless you have an objection . I listened to it . After I heard it , I felt that I should do what I did . I do not know just how much these men may know about what actually happened , but they are entitled to their opinions . Of course , I know why I did what I did . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . This March week has brought a very deep and painful challenge to the unending search for American freedom . That challenge is not yet over , but before it is ended , every resource of this Government will be directed to insuring justice for all men of all races , in Alabama and everywhere in this land . That is the meaning of the oath that I swore before Almighty God when I took the office of the Presidency . That is what I believe in with all of my heart . That is what the people of this country demand . Last Sunday a group of Negro Americans in Selma , Alabama , attempted peacefully to protest the denial of the most basic political right of all the right to vote . They were attacked and some were brutally beaten . From that moment until this , we have acted effectively to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of Selma , and to prevent further violence and lawlessness in this country wherever it occurred . More than 70 United States Government officials , including FBI agents , including Justice Department lawyers , Governor Collins , the Assistant Attorney General , John Doar , whom I asked to go to Selma , have been continuously present in Selma . They have all been working to keep the peace and to enforce the law . At all times the full power of the Federal Government has been ready to protect the people of Selma against further lawlessness . But the final answer to this problem will be found not in armed confrontation , but in the process of law . We have acted to bring this conflict from the streets to the courtroom . Your Government , at my direction , asked the Federal court in Alabama to order the law officials of Alabama not to interfere with American citizens who are peacefully demonstrating for their constitutional rights . When the court has made its order , it must be obeyed . The events of last Sunday cannot and will not be repeated , but the demonstrations in Selma have a much larger meaning , They are a protest against a deep and very unjust flaw in American democracy itself . Ninety five years ago our Constitution was amended to require that no American be denied the right to vote because of race or color . Almost a century later , many Americans are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes . Therefore , this Monday I will send to the Congress a request for legislation to carry out the amendment of the Constitution . Wherever there is discrimination , this law will strike down all restrictions used to deny the people the right to vote . It will establish a simple , uniform standard which cannot be used , however ingenuous the effort , to flaunt our Constitution . If State officials refuse to cooperate , then citizens will be registered by Federal officials . This law is not an effort to punish or coerce anyone . Its object is one which no American in his heart can truly reject . It is to give all our people the right to choose their leaders to deny this right , I think , is to deny democracy itself . What happened in Selma was an American tragedy . The blows that were received , the blood that was shed , the life of the good man that was lost , must strengthen the determination of each of us to bring full and equal and exact justice to all of our people . This is not just the policy of your Government or your President . It is in the heart and the purpose and the meaning of America itself . We all know how complex and how difficult it is to bring about basic social change in a democracy , but this complexity must not obscure the clear and simple moral issues . It is wrong to do violence to peaceful citizens in the streets of their town . It is wrong to deny Americans the right to vote . It is wrong to deny any person full equality because of the color of his skin . The promise of America is a simple promise Every person shall share in the blessings of this land . And they shall share on the basis of their merits as a person . They shall not be judged by their color or by their beliefs , or by their religion , or by where they were born , or the neighborhood in which they live . All my life I have seen America move closer toward that goal , and every step of the way has brought enlarged opportunity and more happiness for all of our people . Those who do injustice are as surely the victims of their own acts as the people that they wrong . They scar their own lives and they scar the communities in which they live . By turning from hatred to understanding they can insure a richer and fuller life for themselves , as well as for their fellows . For if we put aside disorder and violence , if we put aside hatred and lawlessness , we can provide for all our people great opportunity almost beyond our imagination . We will continue this battle for human dignity . We will apply all the resources of this great and powerful Government to this task . We ask that all of our citizens unite in this hour of trial . We will not be moved by anyone or anything from the path of justice . In this task we will seek the help of the divine power which surpasses the petty barriers between man and man , and people and people . Under His guidance we can seek the Biblical promise I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart which shall not be put out . And we will follow that light until all of us have bowed to the command Let there be no strife between me and thee , for we be brethren . I met today with Governor Wallace of Alabama to discuss very thoroughly the situation that exists in that State . The Governor expressed his concern that the demonstrations which have taken place are a threat to the peace and security of the people of Alabama . I expressed my own concern about the need for remedying those grievances which lead to the demonstrations by people who feel their rights have been denied . I said that those Negro citizens of Alabama who have systematically been denied the right to register and to participate in the choice of those who govern them should be provided the opportunity of directing national attention to their plight . They feel that they are being denied a very precious right . And I understand their concern . In his telegram last night to me , Governor Wallace expressed his belief that all eligible citizens are entitled to exercise their right to vote . He repeated that belief today , and he stated that he is against any discrimination in that regard . I am firmly convinced , as I said to the Governor a few moments ago , that when all of the eligible Negroes of Alabama have been registered , the economic and the social injustices they have experienced throughout will be righted , and the demonstrations , I believe , will stop . I advised the Governor of my intention to press with all the vigor at my command to assure that every citizen of this country is given the right to participate in his Government at every level through the complete voting process . The Governor s expressed interest in law and order met with a warm response . We are a Nation that is governed by laws , and our procedures for enacting and amending and repealing these laws must prevail . I told the Governor that we believe in maintaining law and order in every county and in every precinct in this land . If State and local authorities are unable to function , the Federal Government will completely meet its responsibilities . I told the Governor that the brutality in Selma last Sunday just must not be repeated . He agreed that he abhorred brutality and regretted any instance in which any American citizen met with violence . As the Governor had indicated his desire to take actions to remedy the existing situation in Alabama which caused people to demonstrate , I respectfully suggested to him that he consider the following actions which I believed and the Attorney General and others familiar with the matter , and associated with me , believed would be highly constructive at this stage of the game . First , I urged that the Governor publicly declare his support for universal suffrage in the State of Alabama , and the United States of America . Second , I urged him to assure that the right of peaceful assembly will be permitted in Alabama so long as law and order is maintained . Third , I expressed the hope that the Governor would call a biracial meeting when he returns to Alabama , to seek greater cooperation and to ask for greater unity among Americans of both races . I asked the Governor for his cooperation and I expressed my appreciation for his coming to Washington to discuss this problem . I tried to cover that in my statement , but I believe in the right of peaceful assembly . I believe that people have the right to demonstrate . I think that you must be concerned with the rights of others . I do not think a person , as has been said , has the right to holler fire in a crowded theater . But I think that people should have the right to peacefully assemble , to picket , to demonstrate their views , and to do anything they can to bring those views to the attention of people , provided they do not violate laws themselves , and provided they conduct themselves as they should . I will have to let the Governor speak for himself . He is going to appear tomorrow . We spoke very frankly and very forthrightly . We exchanged views and we are not in agreement on a good many things . I am hopeful that the visit will be helpful and I did my best to make my viewpoint clear . The Governor had his share of the conversation . He told me of the problems that he had in Alabama , the fears that he entertained , and he expressed the hope that I could do something to help bring the demonstrations to an end . I told him very frankly that I thought our problem , which I had been working on for several weeks now , was to face up to the cause of the demonstration and remove the cause of the demonstration , and that I hoped if he would give assurance that people would be protected in their demonstrations in Alabama , he would give assurance that he would try to improve the voting situation in Alabama , if I could submit my message to the Congress and get prompt action on it that would insure the right of the people of Alabama to vote , that I thought that we could improve the demonstration situation . I am deeply concerned that our citizens anywhere should be discriminated against and should be denied their constitutional rights . I have plotted my course . I have stated my views . I have made clear , whether the Governor agrees or not , that law and order will prevail in Alabama , that people will be their rights to peacefully assemble will be preserved , and that their constitutional rights will be protected . The presence of a good many people from the South in Selma , the presence of some of the ministers from the South here , the messages that I have received from the citizens of that area , the support that the businessmen and the clergy and the labor people have given the Civil Rights Act and its enforcement , have all given me strength and comfort and encouragement . No , I do not think that I can be much of a prophet in either respect . First , I do not think that Saigon is the place for the wives and children of our military people at the moment , or else I would not ask for them to come out . If the situation changes , and conditions are different , I will pass on them in the light of those changes . I think that anyone that makes a prophecy now as to what the situation will be a year from now would have to be a big guesser . I have had some conversations with Secretary Rusk concerning that case , and I have complete confidence in the manner in which he will handle it . I think we have a very difficult situation there as a result of the instability of the governments and the frequent changes of them . I would not say it has improved in the last 5 weeks . I would say that our policy there is the policy that was established by President Eisenhower , as I have stated , since I have been President , 46 different times , the policy carried on by President Kennedy , and the policy that we are now carrying on . I have stated it as recently as February 17th in some detail and prior to that , in my last press conference , on February 4th . Although the incidents have changed , in some instances the equipment has changed , in some instances the tactics and perhaps the strategy in a decision or two has changed . Our policy is still the same , and that is to any armed attack , our forces will reply . To any in southeast Asia who ask our help in defending their freedom , we are going to give it , and that means we are going to continue to give it . In that region there is nothing that we covet , there is nothing we seek , there is no territory or no military position or no political ambition . Our one desire and our one determination is that the people of southeast Asia be left in peace to work out their own destinies in their own way . I would say that the FBI officials , the marshals in the general area , the United States forces , including the Armed Forces , were ready to carry out any instructions that the President gave them , and the President was prepared to give them any instructions that were necessary and justified and wise . Well , since the Geneva conference of 1962 , as has been stated before , the United States has been in rather active and continuous consultation . We have talked to other governments about the great danger that we could foresee in this aggression in southeast Asia . We have discussed it in the United Nations . We have discussed it in NATWe have discussed it in the SEATO councils . On innumerable occasions we have discussed it directly through diplomatic channels . We have had direct discussions with almost every signatory of the 1954 and the 1962 pacts . We have not had any indication , and as the Secretary of State said the other day , what is still missing is any indication any indication from anyone that Hanoi is prepared or willing or ready to stop doing what it is doing against its neighbors . I think that the absence of this crucial element affects the current discussion of negotiation . A great friend of mine who had great responsibilities for a long period of military and executive life in our Government said to me the other day , When I see the suggestions about negotiation , I wonder if folks do not recognize that there must be someone to negotiate with , and there must be someone willing to negotiate . I know of nothing that either required or justified my making a statement prior to the time that I had a recommendation to make on the problem that was facing us , namely , they were demonstrating about voting rights , and I had that message delivered to me only a few hours ago . I have reviewed it and am in general agreement on what I am going to send to the Congress . It happened that I had the time this afternoon to review it and had the information that was available to me . I think the President should have some leeway when he determines to have press conferences . I have had 46 since I have been President . I plan to have at least one once a month . But the President will determine when they are held , where they are held , and what subjects he discusses .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Members of the House , Members of the Senate , my fellow Americans All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today . The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time . Today John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind . He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind . He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen . No words are sad enough to express our sense of loss . No words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began . The dream of conquering the vastness of space the dream of partnership across the Atlantic and across the Pacific as well the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations the dream of education for all of our children the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them the dream of care for our elderly the dream of an all out attack on mental illness and above all , the dream of equal rights for all Americans , whatever their race or color these and other American dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication . And now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action . Under John Kennedy s leadership , this Nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace , and it has the fortitude to risk war . We have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom . We have shown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny . This Nation will keep its commitments from South Viet Nam to West Berlin . We will be unceasing in the search for peace resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with those with whom we differ and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause . In this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war , we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint . We must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power . We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest . This is the path that we shall continue to pursue . Those who test our courage will find it strong , and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable . We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength and the just can be strong in the defense of justice . And let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution . We will carry on the fight against poverty and misery , and disease and ignorance , in other lands and in our own . We will serve all the Nation , not one section or one sector , or one group , but all Americans . These are the United States a united people with a united purpose . Our American unity does not depend upon unanimity . We have differences but now , as in the past , we can derive from those differences strength , not weakness , wisdom , not despair . Both as a people and a government , we can unite upon a program , a program which is wise and just , enlightened and constructive . For 32 years Capitol Hill has been my home . I have shared many moments of pride with you , pride in the ability of the Congress of the United States to act , to meet any crisis , to distill from our differences strong programs of national action . An assassin s bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the Presidency . I am here today to say I need your help I cannot bear this burden alone . I need the help of all Americans , and all America . This Nation has experienced a profound shock , and in this critical moment , it is our duty , yours and mine , as the Government of the United States , to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay , and to show that we are capable of decisive action that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness , but strength that we can and will act and act now . From this chamber of representative government , let all the world know and none misunderstand that I rededicate this Government to the unswerving support of the United Nations , to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies , to the maintenance of military strength second to none , to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar , to the expansion of our foreign trade , to the reinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in Asia and Africa , and to our Alliance for Progress in this hemisphere . On the 20th day of January , in 1961 , John Kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished in the first thousand days , nor in the life of this administration , nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet . But , he said , let us begin . Today , in this moment of new resolve , I would say to all my fellow Americans , let us continue . This is our challenge not to hesitate , not to pause , not to turn about and linger over this evil moment , but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us . Our most immediate tasks are here on this Hill . First , no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long . We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights . We have talked for one hundred years or more . It is time now to write the next chapter , and to write it in the books of law . I urge you again , as I did in 1957 and again in 1960 , to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this Nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color . There could be no greater source of strength to this Nation both at home and abroad . And second , no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year . This is a bill designed to increase our national income and Federal revenues , and to provide insurance against recession . That bill , if passed without delay , means more security for those now working , more jobs for those now without them , and more incentive for our economy . In short , this is no time for delay . It is a time for action strong , forward looking action on the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in America strong , forward looking action on youth employment opportunities strong , forward looking action on the pending foreign aid bill , making clear that we are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world , nor erasing Executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs and strong , prompt , and forward looking action on the remaining appropriation bills . In this new spirit of action , the Congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch . And in particular , I pledge that the expenditures of your Government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality . I will insist that the Government get a dollar s value for a dollar spent . The Government will set an example of prudence and economy . This does not mean that we will not meet out unfilled needs or that we will not honor our commitments . We will do both . As one who has long served in both Houses of the Congress , I firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch . And I promise you that I shall always respect this . It is deep in the marrow of my bones . With equal firmness , I believe in the capacity and I believe in the ability of the Congress , despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our Nation , to act to act wisely , to act vigorously , to act speedily when the need arises . The need is here . The need is now . I ask your help . We meet in grief , but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor . Let us meet in action , in tolerance , and in mutual understanding . John Kennedy s death commands what his life conveyed that America must move forward . The time has come for Americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another . So let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence . Let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right , from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry , from those defiant of law , and those who pour venom into our Nation s bloodstream . I profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship , making us one people in our hour of sorrow . So let us here highly resolve that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not live or die in vain . And on this Thanksgiving eve , as we gather together to ask the Lord s blessing , and give Him our thanks , let us unite in those familiar and cherished words America , America , God shed His grace on thee , And crown thy good With brotherhood From sea to shining sea .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans In this historic room where just a few minutes ago we honored brave men and great American achievements we have come now to talk about a tragedy and a stain on our American society . I am certain by now that all of you know of the horrible crime which was committed last night between Selma and Montgomery , Alabama . I have been in constant touch with the Attorney General and the Director of the FB Edgar Hoover , throughout the night on this matter . Due to the very fast and the always efficient work of the special agents of the FBI who worked all night long , starting immediately after the tragic death of Viola Liuzzo on a lonely road between Selma and Montgomery , Alabama , arrests were made a few minutes ago of four Ku Klux Klan members in Birmingham , Alabama , charging them with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the murdered woman . Edgar Hoover , our honored public servant who is standing here by me , has advised that the identities of the men charged with this heinous crime are as follows Eugene Thomas , age 43 , of Bessemer William Orville Eaton , age 41 , also of Bessemer Gary Thomas Rowe , , age 31 , of Birmingham and Collie Leroy Wilkins , , age 21 , of Fairfield , Alabama . I cannot express myself too strongly in praising Hoover and the men of the FBI for their prompt and expeditious and very excellent performance in handling this investigation . It is in keeping with the dedicated approach that this organization has shown throughout the turbulent era of civil rights controversies . This Nation and its President are very grateful for the highly intelligent and tireless efforts of the distinguished Attorney General , Nicholas Katzenbach , and his many associates who have carried the Government s fight to insure the rights of all citizens guaranteed to them by the Constitution . The four members of the United Klans of America , Inc . , Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , will of course be arraigned immediately . They will later stand trial . Liuzzo went to Alabama to serve the struggle for justice . She was murdered by the enemies of justice who for decades have used the rope and the gun and the tar and the feathers to terrorize their neighbors . They struck by night , as they generally do , for their purpose cannot stand the light of day . My father fought them many long years ago in Texas and I have fought them all my life because I believe them to threaten the peace of every community where they exist . I shall continue to fight them because I know their loyalty is not to the United States of America but instead to a hooded society of bigots . Men and women have stood against the Klan at times and at places where to do so required a continuous act of courage . So if Klansmen hear my voice today , let it be both an appeal and a warning to get out of the Ku Klux Klan now and return to a decent society before it is too late . I call on every law enforcement officer in America to insist on obedience to the law and to insist on respect for justice . No nation can long endure either in history s judgment or in its own national conscience if hoodlums or bigots can defy the law and can get away with it . Justice must be done in the largest city as well as the smallest village , on the dirt road or on the interstate highway . We will not be intimidated by the terrorists of the Ku Klux Klan any more than we will be intimidated by the terrorists in North Viet Nam . We will reduce the sacrifices of those who suffer now in a society free of the Klan and those who support its vicious work . I am asking and directing Attorney General Katzenbach to proceed at the earliest possible date to develop legislation that will bring the activities of the Klan under effective control of the law , and I am hopeful that that legislation can be submitted just as soon as we can get the present voters rights legislation through the Congress . In connection with new legislation , congressional committees may wish to investigate the activities of such organizations and the part that they play in instigating violence . And I hope that if the congressional committees do decide to proceed forthwith , they can be assured of the cooperation of all patriotic Americans and certainly we will make all the resources of the Federal Government , the Justice Department , and FBI available to them .<speech_sep>Speaker , President , Members of the Congress and my fellow AmericansFor the sixth and the last time , I present to the Congress my assessment of the State of the Union . I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity and about the commitments that all of us have made together that will , if we carry them out , give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want . Every President lives , not only with what is , but with what has been and what could be . Most of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence extending back through several years and extending back through several other administrations . Urban unrest , poverty , pressures on welfare , education of our people , law enforcement and law and order , the continuing crisis in the Middle East , the conflict in Vietnam , the dangers of nuclear war , the great difficulties of dealing with the Communist powers , all have this much in common They and their causes the causes that gave rise to them all of these have existed with us for many years . Several Presidents have already sought to try to deal with them . One or more Presidents will try to resolve them or try to contain them in the years that are ahead of us . But if the Nation s problems are continuing , so are this great Nation s assets our economy , the democratic system , our sense of exploration , symbolized most recently by the wonderful flight of the Apollo 8 , in which all Americans took great pride , the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people , and their essential love of justice . We must not ignore our problems . But neither should we ignore our strengths . Those strengths are available to sustain a President of either party to support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas . Unfortunately , the departure of an administration does not mean the end of the problems that this administration has faced . The effort to meet the problems must go on , year after year , if the momentum that we have all mounted together in these past years is not to be lost . Although the struggle for progressive change is continuous , there are times when a watershed is reached when there is if not really a break with the past at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes , and a stepping forth into a new environment , to seek new goals . I think the past 5 years have been such a time . We have finished a major part of the old agenda . Some of the laws that we wrote have already , in front of our eyes , taken on the flesh of achievement . Medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of American life . Voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the riffles , and the doors to public service , are open at last to all Americans regardless of their color . Schools and school children all over America tonight are receiving federal assistance to go to good schools . Preschool education Head Start is already here to stay and , I think , so are the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities of this country . Part of the American earth not only in description on a map , but in the reality of our shores , our hills , our parks , our forests , and our mountains has been permanently set aside for the American public and for their benefit . And there is more that will be set aside before this administration ends . Five million Americans have been trained for jobs in new federal programs . I think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this Nation is close to full employment with less unemployment than we have had at any time in almost 20 years . That is not in theory that is in fact . Tonight , the unemployment rate is down to 3 . 3 percent . The number of jobs has grown more than 8 1 2 million in the last 5 years . That is more than in all the preceding 12 years . These achievements completed the full cycle , from idea to enactment and , finally , to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country . I wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and the administration achieved during this period had already completed that cycle . But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding to become a tangible realization . Yet the very existence of these commitments these promises to the American people , made by this Congress and by the executive branch of the Government are achievements in themselves , and failure to carry through on our commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation . This much is certain No one man or group of men made these commitments alone . Congress and the executive branch , with their checks and balances , reasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land . They now have all the moral force that the American political system can summon when it acts as one . They express America s common determination to achieve goals . They imply action . In most cases , you have already begun that action but it is not fully completed , of course . Let me speak for a moment about these commitments . I am going to speak in the language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these measures . I am going to quote from your words . In 1966 , Congress declared that improving the quality of urban life is the most critical domestic problem facing the United States . Two years later it affirmed the historic goal of a decent home . . . for every American family . That is your language . Now to meet these commitments , we must increase our support for the model cities program , where blueprints of change are already being prepared in more than 150 American citiesTo achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already passed , we should begin this year more than 500 , 000 homes for needy families in the coming fiscal year . Funds are provided in the new budget to do just this . This is almost 10 times 10 times the average rate of the past 10 years . Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of their growing populations . So I believe an urban development bank should be created by the Congress . This bank could obtain resources through the issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced rates to the communities throughout the land for schools , hospitals , parks , and other public facilities . Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935 , Congress has recognized the necessity to make more adequate provision for aged persons . . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public health . Those are the words of the Congress more adequate . The time has come , I think , to make it more adequate . I believe we should increase social security benefits , and I am so recommending tonight . I am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at least 13 percent . Those who receive only the minimum of 55 should get 80 a month . Our Nation , too , is rightfully proud of our medical advances . But we should remember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its infant mortality rate . I think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their children during the first year of their life in the United States of America . I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of catastrophic illness . As we pass on from medicine , I think nothing is clearer to the Congress than the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty . Congress expressed it well , I think , in 1964 , when they said It is the policy of the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation . This is the richest nation in the world . The antipoverty program has had many achievements . It also has some failures . But we must not cripple it after only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been with us and have been building up among us for generations . I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to other agencies . I believe , though , it will want to continue , until we have broken the back of poverty , the efforts we are now making throughout this land . I believe , and I hope the next administration I believe they believe that the key to success in this effort is jobs . It is work for people who want to work . In the budget for fiscal 1970 , I shall recommend a total of 3 . 5 billion for our job training program , and that is five times as much as we spent in 1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their own living . The Nation s commitment in the field of civil rights began with the Declaration of Independence . They were extended by the 13th , 14th , and 15th amendments . They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of three far reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years , that this Congress , in its wisdom , passed . On January 1 of this year , the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20 million American homes and apartments . The prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously enforced throughout this land . I believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting Rights Act for another 5 years . In the Safe Streets Act of 1968 , Congress determined To assist state and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime . This year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full 300 million that the Congress last year authorized to do just that . I hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is . I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the United States . I hope these grants can be made to the States and they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country . But all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be made I think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nation if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest . Frankly , as I leave the Office of the Presidency , one of my greatest disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearms . I think if we had passed that act , it would have reduced the incidence of crime . I believe that the Congress should adopt such a law , and I hope that it will at a not too distant date . In order to meet our long standing commitment to make government as efficient as possible , I believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the lines of the Kappel report . I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve their country . I believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive , Legislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound . Later this week , I shall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership this evening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the Commission s recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries . For Members of Congress , I will recommend the basic compensation not of the 50 , 000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the other distinguished Members , but I shall reduce that 50 , 000 to 42 , 500 . I will suggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expenses , so that Members will not be required to use their salary increase for essential official business . I would have submitted the Commission s recommendations , except the advice that I received from the leadership and you usually are consulted about matters that affect the Congress was that the Congress would not accept the 50 , 000 recommendation , and if I expected my recommendation to be seriously considered , I should make substantial reductions . That is the only reason I did not go along with the Kappel report . In 1967 1 recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft . I submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration . I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all of these commitments I talk about will cost money . If we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8 years , I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these commitments . We have already been able to increase our support for major social programs although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything on the home front because of Vietnam but we have been able in the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education from 30 billion in 1964 to 68 billion in the coming fiscal year . That is more than double . That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188 years of this Republic , notwithstanding Vietnam . We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar . Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January when we made our estimates . At that time , you will remember that we estimated we would have a deficit of 8 billion . Well , I am glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1969 , this June , we are going to have not a deficit , but we are going to have a 2 . 4 billion surplus . You will receive the budget tomorrow . The budget for the next fiscal year , that begins July 1 which you will want to examine very carefully in the days ahead will provide a 3 . 4 billion surplus . This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted last year . I have communicated with the President elect , Nixon , in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being . I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as circumstances will permit , but the President elect has told me that he has concluded that until his administration , and this Congress , can examine the appropriation bills , and each item in the budget , and can ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced , he , Nixon , will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued . Americans , I believe , are united in the hope that the Paris talks will bring an early peace to Vietnam . And if our hopes for an early settlement of the war are realized , then our military expenditures can be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable purposes , as the Congress may determine . In any event , I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity . I think all Americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep , and it has brought record profits , the highest in our history , and record wages . Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our Nation s history . Our wages have been the highest . Our profits have been the best . This prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years . I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have achieved a surplus . It appears that we have , in fact , done better this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957 . The quest for a durable peace , I think , has absorbed every administration since the end of World War IIt has required us to seek a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers , but among the smaller nations as well . We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963 , the outer space treaty of 1967 , and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968 . This latter agreement the nonproliferation treaty is now pending in the Senate and it has been pending there since last July . In my opinion , delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace . America took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date . Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the superpowers , mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension . So , I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet Union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems . I think they would already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election this year . It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to aid the developing nations . We knew then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery . During these years there have been great advances made under our program , particularly against want and hunger , although we are disappointed at the appropriations last year . We thought they were woefully inadequate . This year I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world . I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation . Among those efforts , that of Western Europe has a very special place in America s concern . The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity . I think America remains ready to work with a united Europe , to work as a partner on the basis of equality . For the future , the quest for peace , I believe , requires that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become the leading nation in world trade , that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity , and that we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served . The strained relationship between us and the world s leading Communist power has not ended especially in the light of the brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia . But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world catastrophe . What we do , we do in the interest of peace in the world . We earnestly hope that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and individual freedom . The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam , and in the Paris talks . I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam . The prospects , I think , for peace are better today than at any time since North Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years ago . The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time that America cares about their freedom , and it also cares about America s own vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific . The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purposes by force . There may be hard fighting before a settlement is reached but , I can assure you , it will yield no victory to the Communist cause . I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us . I have been honored to be their Commander in Chief . The Nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continues and its enduring gratitude when their service is done . Finally , the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many capitals tonight . America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the Security Council which points the way . There must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today . It is a threat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States , but it is a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well . Now , my friends in Congress , I want to conclude with a few very personal words to you . I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional leadership s invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight . I did that for two reasons . One was philosophical . I wanted to give you my judgment , as I saw it , on some of the issues before our Nation , as I view them , before I leave . The other was just pure sentimental . Most all of my life as a public official has been spent here in this building . For 38 years since I worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of Representatives I have known these halls , and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked them . I know the questions that you face . I know the conflicts that you endure . I know the ideals that you seek to serve . I left here first to become Vice President , and then to become , in a moment of tragedy , the President of the United States . My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges , both at home and throughout the world . In meeting some of these challenges , the Nation has found a new confidence . In meeting others , it knew turbulence and doubt , and fear and hate . Throughout this time , I have been sustained by my faith in representative democracy a faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator . I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation described by the Constitution , tempered by history , embodied in progressive laws , and given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow citizens . Now for five most demanding years in the White House , I have been strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents , Harry Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower . I have been guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved John Kennedy , and with our greatest modern legislator , Speaker Sam Rayburn . I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way , Vice President Hubert Humphrey . I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the loyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert . I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield , and I am sure that I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel of the President Pro Tem of the Senate , Senator Richard Brevard Russell . I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States , Senator Dirksen and Congressman Gerald Ford , the Minority Leader . No President should ask for more , although I did upon occasions . But few Presidents have ever been blessed with so much . President elect Nixon , in the days ahead , is going to need your understanding , just as I did . And he is entitled to have it . I hope every Member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President , will be borne for all of us . Each of us should try not to increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage . Now , it is time to leave . I hope it may be said , a hundred years from now , that by working together we helped to make our country more just , more just for all of its people , as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for all of our posterity . That is what I hope . But I believe that at least it will be said that we tried . Speaker , President , Members of the Congress and my fellow Americans For the sixth and the last time , I present to the Congress my assessment of the State of the Union . I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity and about the commitments that all of us have made together that will , if we carry them out , give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want . Every President lives , not only with what is , but with what has been and what could be . Most of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence extending back through several years and extending back through several other administrations . Urban unrest , poverty , pressures on welfare , education of our people , law enforcement and law and order , the continuing crisis in the Middle East , the conflict in Vietnam , the dangers of nuclear war , the great difficulties of dealing with the Communist powers , all have this much in common They and their causes the causes that gave rise to them all of these have existed with us for many years . Several Presidents have already sought to try to deal with them . One or more Presidents will try to resolve them or try to contain them in the years that are ahead of us . But if the Nation s problems are continuing , so are this great Nation s assets our economy , the democratic system , our sense of exploration , symbolized most recently by the wonderful flight of the Apollo 8 , in which all Americans took great pride , the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people , and their essential love of justice . We must not ignore our problems . But neither should we ignore our strengths . Those strengths are available to sustain a President of either party to support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas . Unfortunately , the departure of an administration does not mean the end of the problems that this administration has faced . The effort to meet the problems must go on , year after year , if the momentum that we have all mounted together in these past years is not to be lost . Although the struggle for progressive change is continuous , there are times when a watershed is reached when there is if not really a break with the past at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes , and a stepping forth into a new environment , to seek new goals . I think the past 5 years have been such a time . We have finished a major part of the old agenda . Some of the laws that we wrote have already , in front of our eyes , taken on the flesh of achievement . Medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of American life . Voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the riffles , and the doors to public service , are open at last to all Americans regardless of their color . Schools and school children all over America tonight are receiving federal assistance to go to good schools . Preschool education Head Start is already here to stay and , I think , so are the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities of this country . Part of the American earth not only in description on a map , but in the reality of our shores , our hills , our parks , our forests , and our mountains has been permanently set aside for the American public and for their benefit . And there is more that will be set aside before this administration ends . Five million Americans have been trained for jobs in new federal programs . I think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this Nation is close to full employment with less unemployment than we have had at any time in almost 20 years . That is not in theory that is in fact . Tonight , the unemployment rate is down to 3 . 3 percent . The number of jobs has grown more than 8 1 2 million in the last 5 years . That is more than in all the preceding 12 years . These achievements completed the full cycle , from idea to enactment and , finally , to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country . I wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and the administration achieved during this period had already completed that cycle . But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding to become a tangible realization . Yet the very existence of these commitments these promises to the American people , made by this Congress and by the executive branch of the Government are achievements in themselves , and failure to carry through on our commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation . This much is certain No one man or group of men made these commitments alone . Congress and the executive branch , with their checks and balances , reasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land . They now have all the moral force that the American political system can summon when it acts as one . They express America s common determination to achieve goals . They imply action . In most cases , you have already begun that action but it is not fully completed , of course . Let me speak for a moment about these commitments . I am going to speak in the language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these measures . I am going to quote from your words . In 1966 , Congress declared that improving the quality of urban life is the most critical domestic problem facing the United States . Two years later it affirmed the historic goal of a decent home . . . for every American family . That is your language . Now to meet these commitments , we must increase our support for the model cities program , where blueprints of change are already being prepared in more than 150 American citiesTo achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already passed , we should begin this year more than 500 , 000 homes for needy families in the coming fiscal year . Funds are provided in the new budget to do just this . This is almost 10 times 10 times the average rate of the past 10 years . Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of their growing populations . So I believe an urban development bank should be created by the Congress . This bank could obtain resources through the issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced rates to the communities throughout the land for schools , hospitals , parks , and other public facilities . Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935 , Congress has recognized the necessity to make more adequate provision for aged persons . . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public health . Those are the words of the Congress more adequate . The time has come , I think , to make it more adequate . I believe we should increase social security benefits , and I am so recommending tonight . I am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at least 13 percent . Those who receive only the minimum of 55 should get 80 a month . Our Nation , too , is rightfully proud of our medical advances . But we should remember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its infant mortality rate . I think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their children during the first year of their life in the United States of America . I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of catastrophic illness . As we pass on from medicine , I think nothing is clearer to the Congress than the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty . Congress expressed it well , I think , in 1964 , when they said It is the policy of the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation . This is the richest nation in the world . The antipoverty program has had many achievements . It also has some failures . But we must not cripple it after only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been with us and have been building up among us for generations . I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to other agencies . I believe , though , it will want to continue , until we have broken the back of poverty , the efforts we are now making throughout this land . I believe , and I hope the next administration I believe they believe that the key to success in this effort is jobs . It is work for people who want to work . In the budget for fiscal 1970 , I shall recommend a total of 3 . 5 billion for our job training program , and that is five times as much as we spent in 1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their own living . The Nation s commitment in the field of civil rights began with the Declaration of Independence . They were extended by the 13th , 14th , and 15th amendments . They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of three far reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years , that this Congress , in its wisdom , passed . On January 1 of this year , the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20 million American homes and apartments . The prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously enforced throughout this land . I believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting Rights Act for another 5 years . In the Safe Streets Act of 1968 , Congress determined To assist state and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime . This year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full 300 million that the Congress last year authorized to do just that . I hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is . I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the United States . I hope these grants can be made to the States and they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country . But all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be made I think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nation if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest . Frankly , as I leave the Office of the Presidency , one of my greatest disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearms . I think if we had passed that act , it would have reduced the incidence of crime . I believe that the Congress should adopt such a law , and I hope that it will at a not too distant date . In order to meet our long standing commitment to make government as efficient as possible , I believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the lines of the Kappel report . I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve their country . I believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive , Legislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound . Later this week , I shall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership this evening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the Commission s recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries . For Members of Congress , I will recommend the basic compensation not of the 50 , 000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the other distinguished Members , but I shall reduce that 50 , 000 to 42 , 500 . I will suggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expenses , so that Members will not be required to use their salary increase for essential official business . I would have submitted the Commission s recommendations , except the advice that I received from the leadership and you usually are consulted about matters that affect the Congress was that the Congress would not accept the 50 , 000 recommendation , and if I expected my recommendation to be seriously considered , I should make substantial reductions . That is the only reason I did not go along with the Kappel report . In 1967 1 recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft . I submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration . I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all of these commitments I talk about will cost money . If we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8 years , I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these commitments . We have already been able to increase our support for major social programs although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything on the home front because of Vietnam but we have been able in the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education from 30 billion in 1964 to 68 billion in the coming fiscal year . That is more than double . That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188 years of this Republic , notwithstanding Vietnam . We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar . Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January when we made our estimates . At that time , you will remember that we estimated we would have a deficit of 8 billion . Well , I am glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1969 , this June , we are going to have not a deficit , but we are going to have a 2 . 4 billion surplus . You will receive the budget tomorrow . The budget for the next fiscal year , that begins July 1 which you will want to examine very carefully in the days ahead will provide a 3 . 4 billion surplus . This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted last year . I have communicated with the President elect , Nixon , in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being . I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as circumstances will permit , but the President elect has told me that he has concluded that until his administration , and this Congress , can examine the appropriation bills , and each item in the budget , and can ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced , he , Nixon , will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued . Americans , I believe , are united in the hope that the Paris talks will bring an early peace to Vietnam . And if our hopes for an early settlement of the war are realized , then our military expenditures can be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable purposes , as the Congress may determine . In any event , I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity . I think all Americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep , and it has brought record profits , the highest in our history , and record wages . Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our Nation s history . Our wages have been the highest . Our profits have been the best . This prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years . I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have achieved a surplus . It appears that we have , in fact , done better this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957 . The quest for a durable peace , I think , has absorbed every administration since the end of World War IIt has required us to seek a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers , but among the smaller nations as well . We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963 , the outer space treaty of 1967 , and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968 . This latter agreement the nonproliferation treaty is now pending in the Senate and it has been pending there since last July . In my opinion , delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace . America took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date . Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the superpowers , mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension . So , I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet Union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems . I think they would already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election this year . It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to aid the developing nations . We knew then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery . During these years there have been great advances made under our program , particularly against want and hunger , although we are disappointed at the appropriations last year . We thought they were woefully inadequate . This year I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world . I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation . Among those efforts , that of Western Europe has a very special place in America s concern . The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity . I think America remains ready to work with a united Europe , to work as a partner on the basis of equality . For the future , the quest for peace , I believe , requires that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become the leading nation in world trade , that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity , and that we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served . The strained relationship between us and the world s leading Communist power has not ended especially in the light of the brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia . But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world catastrophe . What we do , we do in the interest of peace in the world . We earnestly hope that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and individual freedom . The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam , and in the Paris talks . I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam . The prospects , I think , for peace are better today than at any time since North Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years ago . The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time that America cares about their freedom , and it also cares about America s own vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific . The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purposes by force . There may be hard fighting before a settlement is reached but , I can assure you , it will yield no victory to the Communist cause . I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us . I have been honored to be their Commander in Chief . The Nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continues and its enduring gratitude when their service is done . Finally , the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many capitals tonight . America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the Security Council which points the way . There must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today . It is a threat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States , but it is a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well . Now , my friends in Congress , I want to conclude with a few very personal words to you . I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional leadership s invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight . I did that for two reasons . One was philosophical . I wanted to give you my judgment , as I saw it , on some of the issues before our Nation , as I view them , before I leave . The other was just pure sentimental . Most all of my life as a public official has been spent here in this building . For 38 years since I worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of Representatives I have known these halls , and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked them . I know the questions that you face . I know the conflicts that you endure . I know the ideals that you seek to serve . I left here first to become Vice President , and then to become , in a moment of tragedy , the President of the United States . My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges , both at home and throughout the world . In meeting some of these challenges , the Nation has found a new confidence . In meeting others , it knew turbulence and doubt , and fear and hate . Throughout this time , I have been sustained by my faith in representative democracy a faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator . I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation described by the Constitution , tempered by history , embodied in progressive laws , and given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow citizens . Now for five most demanding years in the White House , I have been strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents , Harry Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower . I have been guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved John Kennedy , and with our greatest modern legislator , Speaker Sam Rayburn . I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way , Vice President Hubert Humphrey . I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the loyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert . I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield , and I am sure that I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel of the President Pro Tem of the Senate , Senator Richard Brevard Russell . I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States , Senator Dirksen and Congressman Gerald Ford , the Minority Leader . No President should ask for more , although I did upon occasions . But few Presidents have ever been blessed with so much . President elect Nixon , in the days ahead , is going to need your understanding , just as I did . And he is entitled to have it . I hope every Member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President , will be borne for all of us . Each of us should try not to increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage . Now , it is time to leave . I hope it may be said , a hundred years from now , that by working together we helped to make our country more just , more just for all of its people , as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for all of our posterity . That is what I hope . But I believe that at least it will be said that we tried .<speech_sep>I take pleasure this morning in announcing my intention of nominating William Bundy as the Assistant Secretary of State for far Eastern Affairs . Bundy , currently the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs , will bring to his new post great background and experience in the far Eastern field . Bundy will be replaced in the Defense Department post by John McNaughton , the current General Counsel at the Department of Defense . I also wish to announce the appointment of Daniel Luevano , of California , as Assistant Secretary of the Army . Luevano is the Chief Deputy Director of the State Department of finance in California , under Governor Brown , and has consistently demonstrated his ability in a number of governmental posts in his native State , having formerly been assistant to Clark Kerr , the president of the University of California . I would also like to announce the appointment of Frankie Muse freeman , Associate General Counsel of the Louis Housing and Land Clearance Authority , as a new member of the Civil Rights Commission . freeman is a former Assistant Attorney General of the State of Missouri , and distinguished Missouri lawyer . The United States has successfully developed an advanced experimental jet aircraft , the A 11 , which has been tested in sustained flight at more than 2 , 000 miles an hour , and at altitudes in excess of 70 , 000 feet . The performance of the A 11 far exceeds that of any other aircraft in the world today . The development of this aircraft has been made possible by major advances in aircraft technology of great significance for both military and commercial application . Several A 11 aircraft are now being flight tested at Edwards Air force Base in California . The existence of this program is being disclosed today to permit the orderly exploitation of this advanced technology in our military and commercial programs . This advanced experimental aircraft , capable of high speed and high altitude , and long range performance at thousands of miles , constitutes a technological accomplishment that will facilitate the achievement of a number of important military and commercial requirements . The A 11 aircraft now at Edwards Air force Base are undergoing extensive tests to determine their capabilities as long range interceptors . The development of a supersonic commercial transport aircraft will also be greatly assisted by the lessons learned from this A 11 program . for example , one of the most important technical achievements in this project has been the mastery of the metallurgy and fabrication of titanium metal which is required for the high temperatures experienced by aircraft traveling at more than three times the speed of sound . Arrangements are being made to make this and other important technical developments available under appropriate safeguards to those directly engaged in the supersonic transport program . This project was first started in 1959 . Appropriate Members of the Senate and the House have been kept fully informed on the program since the day of its inception . The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation at Burbank , Calif . , is the manufacturer of the aircraft . The aircraft engine , the 1 58 , was designed and built by the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Corporation . The experimental fire control and air to air missile system for the A 11 was developed by the Hughes Aircraft Company . In view of the continuing importance of these developments to our national security , the detailed performance of the A 11 will remain strictly classified and all individuals associated with the program have been directed to refrain from making any further disclosure concerning this program . I do not expect to discuss this important matter further with you today but certain additional information will be made available to all of you after this meeting . If you care , Salinger will make the appropriate arrangements . On Monday I will release a report by Eugene Black and Osborne on the supersonic transport program . This report was submitted to me in December . It makes a number of recommendations dealing with the financing and the management of the supersonic transport program . It has been referred to those Government officials concerned for review and comment . On the basis of their analysis , a decision will be made on how the Government will proceed . I will be glad to take any questions . I do not handle my own security . I was informed that there had been reasons for taking additional precautions , and I asked that the matter be carefully examined and handled entirely by Edgar Hoover and the Secret Service , both of whom work closely together in connection with the President s security . And we followed the suggestions outlined , none of which I am familiar with in detail . I think that is a matter that the Senate is considering . They have witnesses to be heard . The Senate will make its report and take such action as they feel is justified , and I am sure they will take the proper action . We will have to see what the consequences are , following their recommendations when all of the evidence is in . We have asked Secretary McNamara , who has made periodic visits to Saigon , to go to Viet Nam in the next few days . He will go there and have his conferences and will bring back very valuable information . We have a very difficult situation in Viet Nam . We are furnishing advice and counsel and training to the South Viet Nam army . And we must rely on them for such action as is taken to defend themselves . We think that McNamara will correctly appraise the situation on this trip and make such recommendations as he deems appropriate . I do not think that the speculation that has been made that we should enter into a neutralization of that area , or that we are losing the fight in that area , or that things have gone to pot there , are at all justified . I think that they do our cause a great disservice , but we are keeping in close touch with it daily . We have Ambassador Lodge , who heads our forces in that area . He is in constant communication with us . He makes recommendations from time to time . We act promptly on those recommendations . We feel that we are following the proper course and that our national interests are being fully protected . I know of no good purpose that would be served by speculating on the military strategy of the forces of the South Vietnamese . I think that too much speculation has already taken place I think that a good deal of it without justification . I sometimes wonder if General Eisenhower , before the battle of Normandy , had been confronted with all the if the world had all the information concerning his plans that they seem to have concerning ours in Viet Nam , what would have happened on that fateful day . So , I would answer your question merely by saying that I do not care to speculate on what might happen . The plans that have been discussed in the papers are not plans that have come to my attention , or that I have approved . No , I do not think so . Lodge had a brilliant career in the Senate . He served in the United States Army after resigning from the Senate . He had considerable military experience there . He served his country well at the United Nations under the administration of President Eisenhower . He was selected by President Kennedy upon the recommendation of Secretary Rusk . He has been given full authority to act as our top adviser in that area . He had a long conference with me before he returned to Viet Nam in November . I am unaware of any political inclinations he may have . I have seen nothing that he has done that has in any way interfered with his work out there . I think that he has properly assessed the situation himself by saying that since he is our Ambassador there he cannot personally get involved in the campaign plans that some of his friends may have for him . I would hope that we could reach an agreement as early as possible . As soon as I learned that the Panamanians had marched on our zone and we had a disturbance there , and some of our soldiers had been killed , some of the students had raised the flag and this disturbance had resulted , I immediately called the President of Panama on the telephone and said to him in that first exchange , I want to do everything I can to work this problem out peacefully and quickly . Therefore our people will meet with your people any time , anywhere , to discuss anything that will result in bringing peace and stopping violence . The President asked me how long it would be before those discussions could take place , and I said we would have a team in the air within 30 minutes . I designated Assistant Secretary Mann to leave immediately . We have been pursuing those discussions ever since . We have reached no agreement . One day you see speculation that an agreement is imminent . The next day you see speculation that we are very pessimistic . I think both reports have been wrong . There has been no meeting of the minds . We realize that treaties were written in 1903and modified from time to time that problems are involved that need to be dealt with and perhaps would require adjustment in the treaty in 1963 or 1964 . So we are not refusing to discuss and evolve a program that will be fair and just to all concerned . But we are not going to make any precommitments , before we sit down , on what we are going to do in the way of rewriting new treaties with a nation that we do not have diplomatic relations with . Once those relations are restored , we will be glad , as I said the first day , and as we have repeated every day since , to discuss anything , any time , anywhere , and do what is just and what is fair and what is right . Just because Panama happens to be a small nation , maybe no larger than the city of Louis , is no reason why we should not try in every way to be equitable and fair and just . We are going to insist on that . But we are going to be equally insistent on no preconditions . The United States has made the proper protestations and is doing everything we can to see that that agreement reached is carried out . We have expressed our deep regret that it has not been . We are very hopeful that the interested governments will take the appropriate action to see that the agreement is carried out . We must be concerned not just with our foreign policy in the twentieth century but with the foreign policy of 110 or 120 other nations . We are today dealing with serious problems in many places in the world that seriously affect the peace . When we solve these problems I have no doubt but what there will be others that arise that have been in existence for centuries . It is going to be the course of this Government to do everything that we can to resolve these differences peacefully , even though they are not of our own making . There are few of these situations which have been brought about by anything that we have done , but they are age old differences that have existed for centuries . I am an optimist . I spent 35 days in meetings with the Security Council in the Cuban missile crisis . I saw the alternatives presented there . I realized that we can , with the great power we have , perhaps destroy 100 million people in a matter of minutes , and our adversaries can do likewise . I do not think that the people of the world want that to happen and I think we are going to do everything that we can to avoid its happening . Now there are going to be some very serious problems that we have to resolve before we achieve peace in the world , if we achieve it completely , but we are going to continue to try to resolve them . I am encouraged and I am not pessimistic about the future . I believe that we have adequate machinery to deal with these problems and I sincerely and genuinely believe that the people of the world want peace more than they want anything else and that , in time , through their leaders , someway , somehow we will find the answer . Well , I have been reasonably close to the Presidency during the 30 years that I have been in Washington , particularly the last 3 years . But I have gotten many different impressions in the last hundred days than I had before I came to this awesome responsibility . I am deeply impressed by the spirit of unity in this country , by the many people of all faiths and all sections who closed ranks and were anxious to unite the country following the tragic affair of last November . I am quite pleased with the manner in which the executive personnel has carried on following the death of their great leader , how the Cabinet has functioned to a man in this crisis . I think the continuity and the transition and the organization of the budget and the various messages , and the outline of the program has created confidence in the country and in the world . I am pleased with what the Congress has done in the field of passing 10 of the 15 appropriations bills in the first hundred days , that were carried over from last year , and in passing the education bills that made this Congress known as the greatest education Congress in the history of our land in the passage of the civil rights bill in the House of Representatives after it had been considered there for some 6 or 7 months in the passage of the tax bill in the United States Senate after it had been there almost 13 months , and now finally enacted into law . While I have been lavishly praised by some , and I think lavishly criticized by some , I think generally speaking the American Nation has conducted itself as you would expect it to in a crisis and would get very good grades . Insofar as I am concerned I am rather pleased with what has been accomplished in the first hundred days as a result of men and women of good will working together . Well , I have not been nominated yet . I think we will have plenty of time to decide that one after the convention . I will cross that bridge when I come to it . We are very interested in that conference . We are going to participate in it and make every contribution we can . We think it is essential in the interest of the peoples of the world that trade barriers be pulled down . And we are going to contribute everything we can to that end . I did not get the first part of your question . No , I have not speculated on whether I will run or even who I will run against if I do run . That is a matter for the conventions of the two parties to determine when the delegates are properly chosen and they act . All I know about who may be interested in the job is from what I see in the papers , and the activities of the various individuals . We are deeply concerned with it . We think it is a very serious situation . We sent our Under Secretary , the very able George Ball , across the water to talk to the people in Cyprus , and the people in Turkey and the people in Greece and the people in Great Britain and the guarantor powers . We felt that we should make every possible effort to resolve these differences and to avoid more serious consequences . The matter is now pending in the United Nations , and we are doing our dead level best to find the solution . We are concerned as it is extremely serious , but we believe that it will be resolved and we certainly hope so . Yesterday , just before lunch , I was informed that the Commerce Department was giving consideration to adding lard to that list . Rumors had been circulating in the trade for a few hours that it was expected that there would be a huge sale of lard involved , and my judgment was requested . I concurred in the judgment of the Commerce Department that before a license was issued we should carefully consider what we were doing , and that if the rumors were true , the matter needed further attention . Now we have no evidence that these rumors are going to develop into facts , but if they do , the Commerce Department will judicially examine all the facts and make a determination that justifies our Government acting in our national interests . Now what action it will take will be determined after the case is heard , if the rumors and speculation seem to be true . I think the President has a responsibility to do the very best job he can as President for all the people . I think in order to do that it is important for the people to know the problems that confront him . Man s judgment on any given question is no better than the facts he has on that question . So I go along with the view expressed by Jefferson , that the collective judgment of the many is much to be preferred to the selective decisions of the few . I shall have my Press Secretary hold daily briefings , at least two a day , and make available all information that can be made available to the press . From time to time I will see individual members of the press about press business , and I may see some of my full time friends socially , occasionally , I hope without too much criticism . Other times I will have them in my office , if I have any announcements that I think worthy of their attention and taking their time . At other times I will have a meeting like this to reach the folks who the press may not be able to reach through the ordinary newspaper or magazine media so that we can have radio coverage and television coverage . I know of nothing in the President s job that is more important than being held accountable to the people , explaining to the people the reasons for his action , and telling the people something about the problems that confront him , because they are a very understanding group once they have the facts . I have never discussed this with anyone and I would suspect that those rumors which you talk about , which I have read about , are strictly Republican in origin . I will say that the civil rights bill which passed the House is the bill that this administration recommends . I am in favor of it passing the Senate exactly in its present form . I realize there will be some Senators who will want to strengthen it , some who will want to weaken it . But so far as this administration is concerned , its position is firm and we stand on the House bill . The speculation on Viet Nam has been going on for some time . I was out there in 1961 . There was a good deal of speculation then . In my California speech I intended to say just what I did , that aggressors who intend to envelop peaceful , liberty loving , free people , and attempt to do so through aggressive means , are playing a very dangerous game . That is what I said , that is what I meant , and that is a very dangerous situation there and has been for some time . We know that we have very serious problems in that area . We want to have the very best people that we can handling those problems . As I told you , on . the ground in Viet Nam we have Ambassador Lodge . He has been sent additional assistance since I took office in November , and there are several new and very highly competent faces that have gone out at his request and with his approval . Hilsman felt that he should return to his faculty duties and he submitted his resignation to us . We had a reasonable time to select his successor . We reviewed the several possible persons to succeed him . We felt Hilsman was a very able and a very conscientious and very effective public servant , and we realized it was difficult to fill his shoes . We finally concluded , after conferring with Secretary Rusk at some length , that we should ask Secretary McNamara if he would be willing to let Bundy resign his place under his administration and move over to the State Department to take over Hilsman s duties . Thorough consideration was given to it and McNamara reluctantly agreed , but did agree and we have been able to prevail upon Bundy to do that . We think that he is the best possible successor that we could have to Hilsman , and we do think that this whole area needs every bit of the best manpower that it can get . Thank you , President . I take pleasure this morning in announcing my intention of nominating William Bundy as the Assistant Secretary of State for far Eastern Affairs . Bundy , currently the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs , will bring to his new post great background and experience in the far Eastern field . Bundy will be replaced in the Defense Department post by John McNaughton , the current General Counsel at the Department of Defense . I also wish to announce the appointment of Daniel Luevano , of California , as Assistant Secretary of the Army . Luevano is the Chief Deputy Director of the State Department of finance in California , under Governor Brown , and has consistently demonstrated his ability in a number of governmental posts in his native State , having formerly been assistant to Clark Kerr , the president of the University of California . I would also like to announce the appointment of Frankie Muse freeman , Associate General Counsel of the Louis Housing and Land Clearance Authority , as a new member of the Civil Rights Commission . freeman is a former Assistant Attorney General of the State of Missouri , and distinguished Missouri lawyer . The United States has successfully developed an advanced experimental jet aircraft , the A 11 , which has been tested in sustained flight at more than 2 , 000 miles an hour , and at altitudes in excess of 70 , 000 feet . The performance of the A 11 far exceeds that of any other aircraft in the world today . The development of this aircraft has been made possible by major advances in aircraft technology of great significance for both military and commercial application . Several A 11 aircraft are now being flight tested at Edwards Air force Base in California . The existence of this program is being disclosed today to permit the orderly exploitation of this advanced technology in our military and commercial programs . This advanced experimental aircraft , capable of high speed and high altitude , and long range performance at thousands of miles , constitutes a technological accomplishment that will facilitate the achievement of a number of important military and commercial requirements . The A 11 aircraft now at Edwards Air force Base are undergoing extensive tests to determine their capabilities as long range interceptors . The development of a supersonic commercial transport aircraft will also be greatly assisted by the lessons learned from this A 11 program . for example , one of the most important technical achievements in this project has been the mastery of the metallurgy and fabrication of titanium metal which is required for the high temperatures experienced by aircraft traveling at more than three times the speed of sound . Arrangements are being made to make this and other important technical developments available under appropriate safeguards to those directly engaged in the supersonic transport program . This project was first started in 1959 . Appropriate Members of the Senate and the House have been kept fully informed on the program since the day of its inception . The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation at Burbank , Calif . , is the manufacturer of the aircraft . The aircraft engine , the 1 58 , was designed and built by the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Corporation . The experimental fire control and air to air missile system for the A 11 was developed by the Hughes Aircraft Company . In view of the continuing importance of these developments to our national security , the detailed performance of the A 11 will remain strictly classified and all individuals associated with the program have been directed to refrain from making any further disclosure concerning this program . I do not expect to discuss this important matter further with you today but certain additional information will be made available to all of you after this meeting . If you care , Salinger will make the appropriate arrangements . On Monday I will release a report by Eugene Black and Osborne on the supersonic transport program . This report was submitted to me in December . It makes a number of recommendations dealing with the financing and the management of the supersonic transport program . It has been referred to those Government officials concerned for review and comment . On the basis of their analysis , a decision will be made on how the Government will proceed . I will be glad to take any questions . I do not handle my own security . I was informed that there had been reasons for taking additional precautions , and I asked that the matter be carefully examined and handled entirely by Edgar Hoover and the Secret Service , both of whom work closely together in connection with the President s security . And we followed the suggestions outlined , none of which I am familiar with in detail . I think that is a matter that the Senate is considering . They have witnesses to be heard . The Senate will make its report and take such action as they feel is justified , and I am sure they will take the proper action . We will have to see what the consequences are , following their recommendations when all of the evidence is in . We have asked Secretary McNamara , who has made periodic visits to Saigon , to go to Viet Nam in the next few days . He will go there and have his conferences and will bring back very valuable information . We have a very difficult situation in Viet Nam . We are furnishing advice and counsel and training to the South Viet Nam army . And we must rely on them for such action as is taken to defend themselves . We think that McNamara will correctly appraise the situation on this trip and make such recommendations as he deems appropriate . I do not think that the speculation that has been made that we should enter into a neutralization of that area , or that we are losing the fight in that area , or that things have gone to pot there , are at all justified . I think that they do our cause a great disservice , but we are keeping in close touch with it daily . We have Ambassador Lodge , who heads our forces in that area . He is in constant communication with us . He makes recommendations from time to time . We act promptly on those recommendations . We feel that we are following the proper course and that our national interests are being fully protected . I know of no good purpose that would be served by speculating on the military strategy of the forces of the South Vietnamese . I think that too much speculation has already taken place I think that a good deal of it without justification . I sometimes wonder if General Eisenhower , before the battle of Normandy , had been confronted with all the if the world had all the information concerning his plans that they seem to have concerning ours in Viet Nam , what would have happened on that fateful day . So , I would answer your question merely by saying that I do not care to speculate on what might happen . The plans that have been discussed in the papers are not plans that have come to my attention , or that I have approved . No , I do not think so . Lodge had a brilliant career in the Senate . He served in the United States Army after resigning from the Senate . He had considerable military experience there . He served his country well at the United Nations under the administration of President Eisenhower . He was selected by President Kennedy upon the recommendation of Secretary Rusk . He has been given full authority to act as our top adviser in that area . He had a long conference with me before he returned to Viet Nam in November . I am unaware of any political inclinations he may have . I have seen nothing that he has done that has in any way interfered with his work out there . I think that he has properly assessed the situation himself by saying that since he is our Ambassador there he cannot personally get involved in the campaign plans that some of his friends may have for him . I would hope that we could reach an agreement as early as possible . As soon as I learned that the Panamanians had marched on our zone and we had a disturbance there , and some of our soldiers had been killed , some of the students had raised the flag and this disturbance had resulted , I immediately called the President of Panama on the telephone and said to him in that first exchange , I want to do everything I can to work this problem out peacefully and quickly . Therefore our people will meet with your people any time , anywhere , to discuss anything that will result in bringing peace and stopping violence . The President asked me how long it would be before those discussions could take place , and I said we would have a team in the air within 30 minutes . I designated Assistant Secretary Mann to leave immediately . We have been pursuing those discussions ever since . We have reached no agreement . One day you see speculation that an agreement is imminent . The next day you see speculation that we are very pessimistic . I think both reports have been wrong . There has been no meeting of the minds . We realize that treaties were written in 1903and modified from time to time that problems are involved that need to be dealt with and perhaps would require adjustment in the treaty in 1963 or 1964 . So we are not refusing to discuss and evolve a program that will be fair and just to all concerned . But we are not going to make any precommitments , before we sit down , on what we are going to do in the way of rewriting new treaties with a nation that we do not have diplomatic relations with . Once those relations are restored , we will be glad , as I said the first day , and as we have repeated every day since , to discuss anything , any time , anywhere , and do what is just and what is fair and what is right . Just because Panama happens to be a small nation , maybe no larger than the city of Louis , is no reason why we should not try in every way to be equitable and fair and just . We are going to insist on that . But we are going to be equally insistent on no preconditions . The United States has made the proper protestations and is doing everything we can to see that that agreement reached is carried out . We have expressed our deep regret that it has not been . We are very hopeful that the interested governments will take the appropriate action to see that the agreement is carried out . We must be concerned not just with our foreign policy in the twentieth century but with the foreign policy of 110 or 120 other nations . We are today dealing with serious problems in many places in the world that seriously affect the peace . When we solve these problems I have no doubt but what there will be others that arise that have been in existence for centuries . It is going to be the course of this Government to do everything that we can to resolve these differences peacefully , even though they are not of our own making . There are few of these situations which have been brought about by anything that we have done , but they are age old differences that have existed for centuries . I am an optimist . I spent 35 days in meetings with the Security Council in the Cuban missile crisis . I saw the alternatives presented there . I realized that we can , with the great power we have , perhaps destroy 100 million people in a matter of minutes , and our adversaries can do likewise . I do not think that the people of the world want that to happen and I think we are going to do everything that we can to avoid its happening . Now there are going to be some very serious problems that we have to resolve before we achieve peace in the world , if we achieve it completely , but we are going to continue to try to resolve them . I am encouraged and I am not pessimistic about the future . I believe that we have adequate machinery to deal with these problems and I sincerely and genuinely believe that the people of the world want peace more than they want anything else and that , in time , through their leaders , someway , somehow we will find the answer . Well , I have been reasonably close to the Presidency during the 30 years that I have been in Washington , particularly the last 3 years . But I have gotten many different impressions in the last hundred days than I had before I came to this awesome responsibility . I am deeply impressed by the spirit of unity in this country , by the many people of all faiths and all sections who closed ranks and were anxious to unite the country following the tragic affair of last November . I am quite pleased with the manner in which the executive personnel has carried on following the death of their great leader , how the Cabinet has functioned to a man in this crisis . I think the continuity and the transition and the organization of the budget and the various messages , and the outline of the program has created confidence in the country and in the world . I am pleased with what the Congress has done in the field of passing 10 of the 15 appropriations bills in the first hundred days , that were carried over from last year , and in passing the education bills that made this Congress known as the greatest education Congress in the history of our land in the passage of the civil rights bill in the House of Representatives after it had been considered there for some 6 or 7 months in the passage of the tax bill in the United States Senate after it had been there almost 13 months , and now finally enacted into law . While I have been lavishly praised by some , and I think lavishly criticized by some , I think generally speaking the American Nation has conducted itself as you would expect it to in a crisis and would get very good grades . Insofar as I am concerned I am rather pleased with what has been accomplished in the first hundred days as a result of men and women of good will working together . Well , I have not been nominated yet . I think we will have plenty of time to decide that one after the convention . I will cross that bridge when I come to it . We are very interested in that conference . We are going to participate in it and make every contribution we can . We think it is essential in the interest of the peoples of the world that trade barriers be pulled down . And we are going to contribute everything we can to that end . I did not get the first part of your question . No , I have not speculated on whether I will run or even who I will run against if I do run . That is a matter for the conventions of the two parties to determine when the delegates are properly chosen and they act . All I know about who may be interested in the job is from what I see in the papers , and the activities of the various individuals . We are deeply concerned with it . We think it is a very serious situation . We sent our Under Secretary , the very able George Ball , across the water to talk to the people in Cyprus , and the people in Turkey and the people in Greece and the people in Great Britain and the guarantor powers . We felt that we should make every possible effort to resolve these differences and to avoid more serious consequences . The matter is now pending in the United Nations , and we are doing our dead level best to find the solution . We are concerned as it is extremely serious , but we believe that it will be resolved and we certainly hope so .

Thank you , President .<speech_sep>TODAY the Government of North Vietnam made a statement which included the following paragraph , and I quote However , for its part , the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares its readiness to appoint its representatives to contact the United States representative with a view to determining with the American side the unconditional cessation of the United States bombing raids and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam so that talks may start . Last Sunday night I expressed the position of the United States with respect to peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia as follows Now , as in the past , the United States is ready to send its representatives to any forum , at any time , to discuss the means of bringing this war to an end . Accordingly , we will establish contact with the representatives of North Vietnam . Consultations with the Government of South Vietnam and our other allies are now taking place . So that you may have as much notice as I am able to give you on another matter , I will be leaving tomorrow evening , late , for Honolulu . I will meet with certain of our representatives , American representatives from South Vietnam , for a series of meetings over the weekend in Hawaii . Thank you very much .

I will meet with certain of our representatives , American representatives from South Vietnam , for a series of meetings over the weekend in Hawaii . Thank you very much .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen Governor John Reed of Maine , who is Chairman of the National Governors Conference , has requested that I send a team of officials to brief the Governors on current developments in Vietnam . He sent me a wire last evening to which I have already responded . I am asking Ambassador Averell Harriman , Gen . Andy Goodpaster of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Walt Rostow of the White House to go to Los Angeles for that purpose . They will stop here Wednesday for an overnight stay before going to Los Angeles . I also asked General Goodpaster to talk to President Eisenhower and to give him a full report on current developments in Vietnam . He has just informed me that he has done that this afternoon . I am asking this team to report in detail to the Governors on the progress that is being made to achieve a better life among the South Vietnamese people . I consider this other war as crucial to the the future of South Vietnam and Southeast Asia as the military struggle . Already American assistance has added some 600 , 000 acres of irrigated land to the agriculture of South Vietnam . It has vastly increased crop yields in that country . Under new land reform measures , a half million acres of land are being sold now to small farmers on easy terms . Another 700 , 000 acres of State owned land will soon be distributed , I am told , to landless refugees from areas that have been controlled by the Vietcong . Fish production has been more than doubled in the past 5 years . Almost 13 , 000 village health stations have been established and stocked with medicine from the United States . We are helping to build a medical school which will graduate as many doctors every year as now serve the entire civilian population of that area of 14 million people . Primary and secondary school enrollment in South Vietnam has increased five times . By 1968 , 13 , 000 new village classrooms will have been built to provide for over three quarters of a million young schoolchildren . We have helped to distribute 7 million textbooks in the . past 3 years and we are providing 1 , 700 new teachers every year . More than 10 , 000 Vietnamese are now receiving vocational training as a result of the program we have laid out in that country . I believe this is a good record . It is a record I would like the American people to know more about . I hope that they will study it , observe it , give us their suggestions in the days to come . We have not waited for the fighting to end before we have the beginnings of the works of peace . We are even now attacking with all of our strength the basic problems in Vietnam illiteracy , poverty , disease . It is these problems that bring on the wars . We must continue to press this battle forward , and we will do so . Komer , my Special Assistant in charge of this work , has just returned from South Vietnam with this report that I have summarized briefly for you . I have asked Secretary McNamara to stop here tomorrow to discuss with me various matters prior to his meeting in Honolulu Friday with Admiral Sharp , Commander in Chief of the Pacific . During his 1 day meeting in Hawaii , Secretary McNamara will receive from Admiral Sharp a report on the program of military operations in Southeast Asia and will discuss logistical plans for future operations . Clark Clifford , Chairman of the President s Advisory Board on Foreign Intelligence , will be coming to the ranch later today to review intelligence matters with me , and will stay overnight here at the ranch . I am nominating Robert Bowie to be Counselor of the Department of State . Bowie is professor of international relations and director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University . He has a distinguished record in the military service and in foreign policy and as a scholar in the field of international affairs . He will be a very valuable new member of the foreign policy advisers who serve the President and who serve this Nation . Today I am nominating four new judges Donald Lay of Omaha , to the Court of Appeals , 8th Circuit . Walter Cummings , , of Chicago , to the Court of Appeals , 7th Circuit . Thomas Fairchild , of Milwaukee , to the Court of Appeals , 7th Circuit . Theodore Cabot , of Fort Lauderdale , to be district judge for the southern district of Florida . I am pleased also to make the following announcements of my intention to send these nominations to the Senate Wilfred Johnson , of Richland , Washington , to be a member of the Atomic Energy Commission . Johnson has been general manager of General Electric s nuclear activities at Hanford , Washington . He has been strongly recommended by the members of the Commission and by members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in the Congress . Paul Miller , president of the University of West Virginia , to be the new Assistant Secretary for Education of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . Frank DiLuzio , Director of the Office of Saline Water , to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior in charge of our very new and important water pollution program that is in that Department . I had the pleasure of visiting with the Vice President by telephone this morning and tie reported to me on his trip to the Dominican Republic where he represented our country at the inauguration of the new President that the people of that country have selected , Balaguer . He had high praise for the people and the leaders of the Dominican Republic for their perseverance and faith during the past year of this great crisis . He said the recent elections represent not only a respect for constitutional government , but the desire of the Dominican people for peace and tranquility . I asked the Vice President to discuss with Balaguer the economic assistance which the United States has been providing the Dominican Republic in the past , and to analyze the future needs of that economy . Balaguer and his government face staggering problems . I think you would be interested in knowing that approximately 25 percent of the working force in the Dominican Republic is presently unemployed . The Vice President reports that the Dominican Government is moving to face these problems forcefully , and he believes effectively . I will discuss the Vice President s report with Secretary Rusk and other officials to make certain we are doing everything we can to assist the courageous people of the Dominican Republic . Rostow is already analyzing and evaluating the Vice President s report and will have recommendations for me when he arrives tomorrow . They seem determined to make constitutional government work in the Dominican Republic and to improve the well being of every citizen . I know that all Americans wish them well . I have today received from Secretary McNamara an appraisal of the efficiency of the buildup of the United States forces in Vietnam . I am pleased , as his report indicates that he will attempt to reduce the planned rates of production substantially 90 to 180 days from now . In the report to the President by Secretary McNamara he says Approximately 1 year ago the buildup of our forces in Vietnam was initiated at your direction . I believe it is timely , he says , to report to you the results of that action . First , I would point out that never before in our history has it been possible to accomplish such a rapid and such an effective expansion of our Armed Forces without the need to mobilize the Reserve forces , and to call up the Reserves , to impose stringent economic controls and emergency controls on our economy , or to require involuntary extensions of active duty throughout the services . As Commander in Chief , you have reason to be proud of the magnificent professional leadership which our men in Vietnam are receiving from General William Westmoreland , his officers , and his noncommissioned officers and men . This matchless leadership is paralleled by the fact that no military force has been so well supplied . Despite the fact that we deployed a military force of more than 100 , 000 men within 120 days and sent them halfway around the world , we have been able to keep that force constantly supplied and equipped so that at all times they have been capable of bringing to bear their full power against the aggressor . As General Earle Wheeler , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , has reported There have been no shortages in supplies for the troops in Vietnam which have adversely affected combat operations or the health or welfare of our troops . No required air sorties have been canceled . As a matter of fact , the air support given our forces is without parallel in our history . With ample inventory stocks still on hand , our production of ammunition and air ordnance this month will exceed our consumption this month . Indeed , says Secretary McNamara , I believe it may very well prove desirable to reduce planned rates of production substantially . Such action would be in keeping with your insistence that the Department of Defense make certain that all military requirements are fulfilled , while achieving this objective with maximum economy for our taxpayers . By continuing to carefully adjust expenditures and production and by resisting the temptation to ask for more money and to spend more money than we need , I believe , says the Secretary , we can avoid the carryover that was represented by 12 billion of surplus and worthless materiel with which we concluded the Korean war . Our buildup has been responsive . It has been forceful , and it has been effective . Just one brief note in conclusion While final figures on the receipts and expenditures for fiscal 1966 which ended June 30th are not yet available , it is very clear to me this morning , after a conference with the Chairman of the President s Economic Advisers and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget , that the administrative budget deficit for this year will be very substantially below the 5 . 3 billion originally estimated in January 1965 , and far below the 6 . 4 billion forecast this past January . This marks the third straight year in which the actual deficit has been lower than what the President predicted . In fiscal 1964 the actual deficit was 3 . 7 billion below what the President promised the Congress in his estimate . In 1965 it was 1 1 2 billion below what the President had recommended in his estimate . We will not know the final 1966 figures for several weeks , but it is already clear that the reduction in the deficit below our original estimate of 18 months ago will be greater than we achieved in 1965 . In the 10 years prior to fiscal 1964 , the actual budget outcome averaged 2 . 9 billion worse than the original predicted figure . I believe the fiscal outcome for the past year and for the previous years for which I am responsible demonstrates three things First , we have tried to make a realistic estimate of both our revenues and expenditures , and to be conservative and careful in those estimates . Second , we have made an unremitting effort to hold our expenditures wherever possible at or below our initial estimates . I am proud to tell you that I believe that will be done so far as domestic expenditures are concerned this year by several hundred millions of dollars . Third , we have maintained the strength and health of our economy so that revenues each year have exceeded our estimates for that year , which the Budget Director tells me is somewhat unusual . We are determined to maintain a sound and a healthy economy which will provide the revenues that we will need to meet our responsibilities in the years ahead . Now I will be glad to take your questions if you have any . The evaluations that we have , and they are still coming in we have new pictures that are being analyzed at this moment the evaluations that we have indicate that about 86 percent of the known petroleum storage capacity in North Vietnam was hit the other evening in a very accurate target operation over the POL targets in the vicinity of Hanoi and Haiphong . The latest estimate of the storage capacity actually destroyed that has come in from the field is 57 percent . In other words , 86 percent of the storage was hit 57 percent they estimate is destroyed . I cannot embrace those figures because the pictures are not complete . But the general officers who have reviewed this told me this morning that they think both estimates are within reason , and they think it was a very successful operation . I think that every general officer carrying responsibilities , either in Vietnam or in the Pentagon , as well as most of our career , experienced , diplomatic observers , think that this action at this time was required by the events of the time . We have developed the best system that we have known how to , in the light of our experiences . We have asked the Pentagon to review it from their standpoint , and they have done so . They are now presenting their views to the appropriate committees in the Congress . I have asked some of our most distinguished citizens Burke Marshall , former Assistant Attorney General Thomas Gates , former Secretary of Defense under General Eisenhower Oveta Culp Hobby , former Director of the WACS and a Cabinet officer under General Eisenhower and some of the best talent in this Nation to review all the alternatives available to a country which finds it necessary to draft its young men . I do not want to prejudge that study . That study is in the process of being made . We will have a very competent staff . We expect to have some conclusions and some recommendations to present to the next session of Congress in ample time for them to carefully consider before the present draft law expires . No , I would not make such an evaluation . I would say so far as ammunition is concerned the Secretary hopes that within 90 to 180 days he can make some recommendations . I think it is his feeling that those recommendations that he will make , which will have the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , will result in the saving of several hundreds of millions of dollars over what the cost would be at the present rate . That is not to indicate , though , that we will not call up additional men that we will not train additional men that we will not procure additional planes that we will not procure additional helicopters that we will not send additional people overseas because we will do all of those things . But we are watching it very carefully so we will not have a 12 billion holdover at the end of the difficulties in Vietnam . Yes . We regret the action that took place in Argentina recently . We have had similar actions of that type in the last year , two or three instances . They are less in the last few months than they have been heretofore . We are very encouraged by what has happened generally in Latin America . We are very proud of our record of growth there . We are spending about a billion dollars , or a little in excess of a billion dollars , in our Alliance for Progress program in Latin America . We find the per capita growth rate has jumped from 1 percent to in excess of 2 1 2 percent . That already equals and exceeds the goals that we had set for the Alliance for Progress . Notwithstanding the grave predictions made and the discouragement that the Dominican people received from many quarters , they have had a peaceful election . A majority of the people have exercised their democratic right to select a government of their own choosing . They have selected that government . They have just finished a similar exercise in Guatemala , and some four or five additional Latin American nations . We would say , as we look around the world , at this hemisphere , Latin America , the prosperity , the democratic evolution that is taking place , when we look over Africa , look over Southeast Asia generally with the exception of our problem in Vietnam when we take a look at the Middle East and Western Europe , we have much to be thankful for , generally speaking , much to be encouraged about . Now I find that true and that to be the judgment of most of our experienced career diplomats . We think that on practically every continent when you look back at Africa just a few months ago , at the serious problems we had in the Congo , and so forth , you look at the Dominican Republic , the Panama situation , the difficulties we had in Brazil , the problems in Chile we have made great progress and generally speaking we are optimistic about most of the continents . If we could only solve the problem in Vietnam , and we think we are on the way to doing that , we could have a world that is rather peaceful and generally prosperous . Well , I think we all read them and are affected by them . We of course would like for every poll to be of our liking . We like to feel that all of them are accurate . We have had a dozen polls , I guess , in the last week . You do not read about the favorable ones , though , I have observed . Gallup reported last week that we had gained 4 percent . Harris reports today that we have about 55 percent of the total in the country . Quayle has made a nationwide survey and he shows about 55 percent . Now that is what you reported as a landslide during General Eisenhower s period . Our poll in California shows a very healthy majority for approval of our record . We believe that it will show the same thing in Iowa . Those are the only two polls that you have cited . We have a number of them that come to us each day . If you are interested in them I will see that Moyers makes them available to you . Maine shows 57 43 percent . That is unusual for a Democratic administration . New Hampshire , 53 47 New Jersey , 7624 Michigan , 62 38 . Although Governor Romney has a substantial majority of the Democrats favoring his record as Governor , we lead Governor Romney in his own State . In Tennessee it is 61 39 . That is considerably better than we were in 1964 . Virginia is 53 47 Texas , 58 42 . We have a good many polls from all over the country . They are not disturbing to us . We think that a 55 percent rating in the country that is the landslide that General Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson by . So we are not upset . We would all like to have as much approval as we can get . But we have to make our judgments and do what we think is right . Then we trust the judgment of the people at election time . I have not the slightest doubt but what they will exercise good judgment . I think our boys under General Westmoreland , his staff officers and the men they are leading , are doing an exceptionally fine job . I want to encourage them in every way I can . I want to support them in every way I can . I am fearful that sometimes we do not give enough thought to those men as we sit here in the luxury of our front porch and our lawn , that we do not recognize the men that are dying for us out in the rice paddies . I do not think you can speak too well of them . Their record has been outstanding . Their results are very good . Our diplomatic reports indicate that the opposing forces no longer really expect a military victory in South Vietnam . I am aware of the dangers of speculation . You do not pay me anything extra for it . So I am not going to guess for you . Suffice it to say , I am proud of what the men are doing . If everyone in this country was working as hard to support the principles of democracy as the men in Vietnam are , I think we would have little to worry about . Yes . First of all , all the Communist countries , generally speaking , opposed it rather vehemently . Some of them were rather vicious in their statements , and I think inaccurate , that we were bombing civilian targets and killing civilians . We were very careful to select military targets that were not in the center of the area and to spare all civilians . We took every precaution available to us . I cannot understand the thinking of any country or any people , or any person , that says we should sit by with our hands tied behind us while these men bring their mortars , their hand grenades and their bombs into our barracks and kill our Marines , attack our camps , murder the village chief , and that we should not do anything about it . Now we have tried to make this difficult for them to continue at their present rate . We do not say it will stop the infiltration . We do not say that it will even reduce it . But we do think it will make it more difficult for them , and we do think it will require them to assign additional people . We do think it will give them problems . We have had a policy of measured response and gradually increased our strength from time to time . We plan to continue that . Most of the Communist countries expressed disapproval . Most of the countries in the area involved , and all of the countries who have bodies there , who have men in uniform there , approved our action . It is difficult for me to understand the response of some nation that is not involved , when a few years ago when their own security was at stake they needed American men and they wanted us to furnish American troops , not to be understanding of what we are trying to do to help others maintain their independence now . I would say that we had very encouraging reports from a good many of our allies . We were disappointed in a few . We expected the regular Communist response , namely , that this would harden the opposition , and that it would not lead to negotiations that we were killing civilians and that we were not bombing military targets . But all those things we considered in advance . And we think we pursued the right course . Since you are talking about polls , I am informed today that the national polls show that 85 percent of the people of this country approved this position . I think we did the right thing at the right time . I hope that we can continue to be as successful in the days ahead in connection with General Westmoreland s operations as we were in this particular exercise . Yes . We are trying in every way we can to find employment for the unemployed in our cities . We are trying in every way we can to get people to quit practicing discrimination in our cities . We are trying to meet the poverty situation as we find it with the limited resources at our command . We are not interested in black power and we are not interested in white power . But we are interested in American democratic power , with a small d . We believe that the citizen ought to be armed with the power to vote . We believe the citizen , regardless of his race or his religion or color , ought to be armed with the right to have a job at decent wages . We believe that every citizen ought to have the right to have a decent home . We are doing everything we can , as quickly as we can , under our voters rights bill , under our civil rights bills , under our housing bills , under proposals we have made in cooperation with the mayors under the able leadership of the Vice President , to improve these terrible conditions that exist in the ghettos of this country . Now we cannot do it all overnight . We are much too late . But we have done more in the last 24 months than has been done in any similar 24 year period to face up to these conditions of health , education , poverty , and discrimination . We are going to continue as long as I am President to do everything we can to see that all citizens are treated equally and have equal opportunities . When we achieve that , I think we will find a good deal of the solution to the problem which you mentioned . I have not read the Paris magazines . No , we do not think so . We are doing everything we can to reach an agreement on such a treaty . We are very anxious to do it . We hope the Soviet Union will meet us and find an acceptable compromise in language which we can both live with . They have some problems at the moment , but we are going to live up to the test ban treaty , religiously and scrupulously follow it . We are going to do everything within the power of our most imaginative people to find language which will bring the nuclear powers together in a treaty which will provide nonproliferation . We think it is one of the most important decisions of our time and we are going to do everything to bring people together on it . No . I think you will see a good deal of me this year . I have been in about 10 States in the last several weeks . I expect to get around the country and talk to the people about our problems and our programs . But I have no announcements to make about my own future except to say I am going to do my dead level best to serve all the people of this country . We have a legislative program yet to be acted on . We have more than half of it already enacted . We had about 85 percent of it enacted last year . We hope to get a substantial part of it completed in the next few months . As time permits , I will be traveling throughout the country . I have been in the States of New York , Illinois , Texas , Nebraska , Virginia , Maryland , Iowa , and New Jersey all in the last 3 or 4 weeks . At that rate , we could cover all 50 of them between now and , say , late October . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Secretary Rusk , Your Excellencies , honored Members of Congress , distinguished guests , ladies and gentlemen This is a very reassuring and hopeful moment in the relations among nations . We have come here today to the East Room of the White House to sign a treaty which limits the spread of nuclear weapons . More than 55 nations are here in Washington this morning to commit their governments to this treaty . Their representatives are also signing today in Moscow and in London . We hope and expect that virtually all the nations will move in the weeks and months ahead to accept this treaty which was commended to the world by the overwhelming majority of the members of the United Nations General Assembly . The treaty s purposes are very simple to commit the nations of the world which do not now have nuclear weapons not to produce or receive them in the future to assure equally that such nations have the full peaceful benefits of the atom and to commit the nuclear powers to move forward toward effective measures of arms control and disarmament . It was just a year ago that Chairman Kosygin and I agreed at Glassboro that we would work intensively in the time ahead to try to achieve this result . After nearly a quarter century of danger and fear reason and sanity have prevailed to reduce the danger and to greatly lessen the fear . Thus , all mankind is reassured . As the moment is reassuring , so it is , even more , hopeful and heartening . For this treaty is evidence that amid the tensions , the strife , the struggle , and the sorrow of these years , men of many nations have not lost the way or have not lost the will toward peace . The conclusion of this treaty encourages the hope that other steps may be taken toward a peaceful world . It is for these reasons and in this perspective that I have described this treaty as the most important international agreement since the beginning of the nuclear age . It enhances the security of all nations by significantly reducing the danger of nuclear war among nations . It encourages the peaceful use of nuclear energy by assuring safeguards against its destructive use . But , perhaps most significantly , the signing of this treaty keeps alive and keeps active the impulse toward a safer world . We are inclined to neglect and to overlook what that impulse has brought about in recent years . These have been fruitful times for the quiet works of diplomacy . After long seasons of patient and painstaking negotiation , we have concluded , just within the past 5 years the Limited Test Ban Treaty , the Outer Space Treaty , and the treaty creating a nuclear free zone in Latin America . The march of mankind is toward the summit not the chasm . We must not , we shall not , allow that march to be interrupted . This treaty , like the treaties it follows , is not the work , as Secretary Rusk said , of any one particular nation . It is the accomplishment of nations which seek to exercise their responsibilities for maintaining peace and maintaining a stable world order . It is my hope and the common will of mankind that all nations will agree that this treaty affords them some added protection . We hope they will accept the treaty and thereby contribute further to international peace and security . As one of the nations having nuclear weapons , the United States all through these years has borne an awesome responsibility . This treaty increases that rest for we have pledged that we shall use our weapons only in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations . Furthermore , we have made clear to United Nations Security Council what would like to repeat today If a state has accepted this treaty does not have weapons and is a victim of aggression , or is subject to a threat of aggression , involving nuclear weapons , the United States shall prepared to ask immediate Security Council action to provide assistance in accordance with the Charter . In welcoming the treaty that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons , I should like to repeat the United States commitment to honor all our obligations under existing treaties of mutual security . Such agreements have added greatly , we think , to the security of our Nation and the nations with which such agreements exist . They have created a degree of stability in a sometimes unstable world . This treaty is a very important security measure . But it also lays an indispensable foundation for expanded cooperation in the peaceful application of nuclear energy for additional measures to halt the nuclear arms race . We will cooperate fully to bring the treaty safeguards into being . We shall thus help provide the basis of confidence that is necessary for increased cooperation in the peaceful nuclear field . After the treaty has come into force we will permit the International Atomic Energy Agency to apply its safeguards to all nuclear activities in the United States excluding only those with direct national security significance . Thus , the United States is not asking any country to accept any safeguards that we are not willing to accept ourselves . As the treaty requires , we shall also engage in the fullest possible exchange of equipment , materials , and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy . The needs of the developing nations will be given especially particular attention . We shall make readily available to the nonnuclear treaty partners the benefits of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes . And we shall do so without delay and under the treaty s provisions . Now at this moment of achievement and great hope , I am gratified to be able to report and announce to the world a significant agreement an agreement that we have actively sought and worked for since January 1964 Agreement has been reached between the Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States to enter in the nearest future into discussions on the limitation and the reduction of both offensive strategic nuclear weapons delivery systems and systems of defense against ballistic missiles . Discussion of this most complex subject will not be easy . We have no illusions that it will be . I know the stubborn , patient persistence that it has required to come this far . We do not underestimate the difficulties that may lie ahead . I know the fears , the suspicions , and the anxieties that we shall have to overcome . But we do believe that the same spirit of accommodation that is reflected in the negotiation of the present treaty can bring us to a good and fruitful result . Man can still shape his destiny in the nuclear age and learn to live as brothers . Toward that goal the day when the world moves out of the night of war into the light of sanity and security I solemnly pledge the resources , the resolve , and the unrelenting efforts of the people of the United States and their Government .<speech_sep>Chairman Governor McKeithen your great senior Senator Allen Ellender , my old friend your fine mayor , Mayor Schiro Long my longtime and my valued friend and colleague , one of the most promising young men in this Nation , Russell Long Congressman Willis , Congressman Morrison , Congressman Thompson , Congressman Gillis Long all of whom serve this Nation and this State with great distinction and with credit to Louisiana and the Congress Marshall Brown Donelon all my friends in Louisiana You have touched me with your generosity and your cordiality . I deeply appreciate the very fine welcome that you gave Lady Bird and Luci when they came in this evening . Every 4 years we seem to have a habit of coming home to New Orleans , and ending our trip on a whistle stop in this lovely , enterprising city . through the years , have always felt close to the people of Louisiana because I was born and reared in an adjoining State , in a neighboring State . I have , as Russell said , spent some time in the Congress , and through those almost 30 years there the Louisiana representatives have always been fair , and just , and effective . I would much rather have them with me than against me , and I have had them both ways . Finally after having opposed Russell on two or three items , on various amendments , on my bill , just before they got ready to pass them , he would get up and offer an amendment and take that left hand and talk Senators into voting for it I finally just told the Secretary of the Senate that I was going to start voting for Russell s amendments it was easier to join him than to fight him . And I have been doing that through the years now , and I have been signing his bills . Senator Ellender gets me to do nearly everything he wants me to without any pilon or lagniappe . But when the going gets tough and he just really has to move heaven and earth , he will put on one of those good feeds of his and he will bring up some of this New Orleans candy that he makes , that we call pralines . I thought he just reserved it for myself until the other day when I went over to have lunch at the White House and the table was empty , with just one plate there . I said , Where in the world is Johnson And they said , She is up eating with Senator Ellender . I said , How long has she been gone And they said , About 15 minutes . So I put on my hat and invited myself . f went up there and I was the only man there except Allen , and he had all the pretty women in Washington up there in the room eating with him So this Louisiana delegation is something that I am very proud of , something that I have enjoyed working with . And I want to remind the people in New Orleans and all Louisiana what Rayburn said one time when they asked him why Texas had such a good , effective delegation in the Congress . He said , Well , we pick them young , and we pick them honest . We send them there , and we keep them there . The last 4 days I have followed that train trip through every yard of the South , and I have called three or four times a day myself just to see how everything was getting along . I do not need to tell you what great pride I have had in my wife and in my daughters and , most of all , in their affection for the people of their homeland and their willingness to come out and stand up on their tiptoes and look them straight in the eyes and tell them what they thought of them and how much we cared and how much we needed them . And I particularly appreciate the way you have reciprocated here in Louisiana . Now , on this occasion , at the close of this week of our campaign , there ought to be grateful pride in the heart of every American . On the main streets of America , history is being made . From Maine to California , from the Midwest to the Deep South , the people of America are coming out . And they are coming out to stand up and be counted for their country . On the streets of all sections we are seeing the largest crowds that we have ever seen in any election period . You know , and I think I know , what this means , and if you do not know what it means , I am going to tell you what it means . Our cause is no longer the cause of a party alone . Our cause is the cause of a great Nation . Our cause is the cause of the country that you love . Our cause is the country that you would die for , and the people are laying down their partisanship . They are asking us to take up their trust . They are asking us to keep this Nation prosperous . They are asking us to keep this Nation progressive . They are asking us to keep this country , and all the world , at peace . The party of the people will not fail the trust of the people . And our first trust is victory , itself , on November 3d , and that is what we are going to have . Too much that is precious , too much that we prize , too much that is part of America itself is at stake for any Democrat , anyone who takes pride in being a Democrat , to rest these next 24 days . This year , as in no year before , you work not as partisans for party , but you work as Americans for America . If victory is our first trust , no less a trust is the margin by which that victory is won . If our position in the world is not to be weakened , if we are to spare ourselves wasteful years of antagonism and division , and animosity here at home , the American people on November 3d must give a decisive reply that will be understood and heard throughout the world . And make no mistake about it , the spotlight of the world is on you November 3d . When victory is ours for our country , not for ourselves I want it to mean a mandate for beginning a new era in American affairs , an era of courage , an era of commonsense , and an era of American confidence . When the next President takes the oath of office next year , it will be 20 years since the end of World War IWhen that war ended , you remember and I have not forgotten what we were told . Voices at home , and voices abroad , predicted That depression would be inevitable . That communism would be irresistible . That war would be unavoidable . And the American people listened and heard , but refused to accept those doctrines . In hope , in faith , in confidence , we took our stand . In the Full Employment Act of 1946 America made a commitment against depression and made a commitment for prosperity here at home . In the Truman doctrine and the Marshall plan of 1948 we made our commitment against the spread of communism and for the strength of freedom throughout the world . In all that we did , we honored our oldest commitment as a Nation and as a people , against war and for peace . The years have been long . The trials have been many . The burdens have been great . But the times are beginning to respond to America s steadfast purpose . This administration is the first in a century not to experience a recession or a depression . This administration is the first since midcentury under which no Nation in the world has fallen to communism . This administration is the first of the postwar age to offer a record not only of peace preserved but of peace courageously and effectively pursued . What the American people set out to do is coming true . Others would have you believe that prosperity is false . Well , ask yourselves or your wife when you go home tonight if that is true . You know it is real . Others would have you believe that freedom is faltering , but you know that you are freer now than you were when you were 21 . And the yoke of dictatorship and the yoke of colonialism is being thrown off of nations all around the world , and new nations are being born , and independence and freedom are on the march . Others would have you believe that the pursuit of peace is unworthy work , but you know it is the most noble work that any nation can do . The point that I am making is simply this The meaning of our victory in November will be just this to assure this confident people of leadership with confidence to match their own . There is work to do , and we can either do it together , united , or we can do it divided , eating on each other . The platform on which I stand says The Federal Government exists not to grow larger , but to enlarge the individual potential and achievement of the people . The Federal Government exists not to subordinate the States , but to support them . I quote the words , but I might offer them as my own , for those words I wrote into the platform . Those words are my beliefs and they have been my beliefs all my life . For so long as I serve in the White House , your Government will be dedicated not to encroaching upon the rights of the States , but to helping the States meet their responsibilities to their own people . Let me be specific . If we are to heal our history and make this Nation whole , prosperity must know no Mason Dixon line and opportunity must know no color line . Robert Lee , a great son of the South , a great leader of the South and I assume no modern day leader would question him or challenge him Robert Lee counseled us well when he told us to cast off our animosities , and raise our sons to be Americans . From the tip of Texas to the tip of Florida , this crescent of the Gulf offers one of the great opportunities of the Western World . I want to see that opportunity fulfilled . I want us to wipe poverty off the face of the South and off the conscience of the Nation . I want us to assure our young the best of education at every level , and the expectation of a good job in their home State when their school years are through . I want us to assure our aged that when they need hospital care they will have it , and they will have paid for it in advance , by themselves , and with the help of their employers , under social security . I may turn out the lights in the White House chandeliers but I am determined that no one will turn out the lights of the REA in the farmhouses of Louisiana . I so much want us to maintain a prosperous , free enterprise economy , so your Governor can continue bringing in new plants and new payrolls and new jobs in the north and in the south of your State . Yes , I see a day , and I know that you see it , too , when New Orleans will stand as a Queen City on this crescent . A center of trade with the world . A center of culture for the Nation . A terminal for waterways reaching the heart of America . A port for the spaceships that are returning from outer space . A good and gracious city for your families to call their home . We are not going to lose that tomorrow in divisions over things of the past . For all America , that will be the meaning of the victory that we seek November 3d . We are going to show the courage to unite America , the commonsense to keep America strong and prepared , and the confidence to seek after peace for the lives of our own people and the lives of all mankind . Courage , commonsense , and confidence those are the qualities that will serve our country s cause , and in this election our country s cause is the cause that we are determined to carry to victory . When I became Democratic leader after General Eisenhower had sent the party of which I was a member to a terrible defeat in 1952 , I told the Members of the Senate who were in the Democratic caucus that I was a free man first , an American second , a Senator third , and a Democrat fourth , in that order that when my President was right and when he spoke for all America and when he sought to unite us against a common enemy , he would have my support . When I thought he was wrong , I would oppose him with decency and dignity , and I would give him my reasons for it , and I would try to suggest an alternative . But I would never personally attack him or assassinate him or talk about his wife or his children or his dogs . I kept that pledge , and for 8 years I served as leader of the Senate during a period that we had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress . And every election , every 2 years , they rewarded us by increasing my majority . The people of America want public servants in America to do what is best for their country first , and if they do what is best for their country , they will do what is best for themselves . When I was called upon in a matter of moments to assume the awesome responsibilities of the Presidency following that tragic day in Dallas , I said to the people of this Nation and the world that with God s help and with your prayers I will do my deadlevel best . I have done that . I have spent long hours , I have worked hard , I have worked with a clear conscience , I have done everything that I could with the talents that the good Lord gave me to try to unite this country and to try to have peace in the world . We had a crisis in Panama a few days after I went in and they shot our soldiers . We had a crisis in Guantanamo , and some of our people in the country hollered , Let us send the Marines in , and I said , No , we will send the admiral in to cut the water off instead of a Marine in to turn it on . We had our ships fired on in the Tonkin Gulf , and we made a prompt reply , an appropriate reply . But we have never lost our heart and I hope we will never lose our head . We are going to keep our eyes in the stars , but we are going to keep our feet on the ground . I think it is a wonderful thing for Louisiana to do , to give us this dinner tonight . I am proud of your delegation . I am especially grateful to Hale and Lindy Boggs and Tommy for all the hard work and days that they spent with Lady Bird , Luci , and Lynda , helping them through these States that we love . I do not want to conclude this talk , though , without telling you that some of my political philosophy was born in this State . As a young secretary , I came to New Orleans before I ever went to Washington . I saw something about the political history of Louisiana . And I saw a man who was frequently praised , and a man who was frequently harassed and criticized , and I became an admirer of his because I thought he had a heart for the people . When I went to Washington in the dark days of the depression as a young country kid from the poor hills of Texas , I had a standing rule with the page office that every time Senator Long took the floor , he would call me on the phone and I would go over there and perch in the Gallery and listen to every word he said . And I heard them all . I heard a lot about the history of this State . I heard a lot of names in this State . But I never heard him make a speech that I did not think was calculated to do some good for some people who needed some speeches made for them and could not make them for themselves . The things that I am talking about from coast to coast I talked to six New England States last week and I am going to speak in six western States next week the things I am talking about from coast to coast tonight and tomorrow and next week are the things that he talked about 30 years ago . He thought that every man had a right to a job , and that was long before the Full Employment Act . He thought that every boy and girl ought to have a chance for all the education they could take , and that is before the GI bill of rights . He thought that the old folks ought to have social security and old age pensions , and I remember when he just scared the dickens out of Roosevelt and went on a nationwide radio hookup talking for old folks pensions . And out of this probably came our social security system . He believed in medical care for those so that they could live in decency and dignity in their declining years , without their children having to come and move them into their house with them . He was against poverty and hated it with all his soul and spoke until his voice was hoarse . Well , like Jack Kennedy , he believed in those same things . But their voices are still tonight , but they have left some to carry on . And as long as the good Lord permits me , I am going to carry on . Now , the people that would use us and destroy us first divide us . There is not any combination in the country that can take on Russell Long , Allen Ellender , Lyndon Johnson , and a few others if we are together . But if they divide us , they can make some hay . And all these years they have kept their foot on our necks by appealing to our animosities , and dividing us . Whatever your views are , we have a Constitution and we have a Bill of Rights , and we have the law of the land , and two thirds of the Democrats in the Senate voted for it and three fourths of the Republicans . I signed it , and I am going to enforce it , and I am going to observe it , and I think any man that is worthy of the high office of President is going to do the same thing . But I am not going to let them build up the hate and try to buy my people by appealing to their prejudice . I heard a great son of Texas who came from an adjoining State , whose name I will not call , but he was expelled from the university over there and he started West , and he got to Texas as a boy and stopped to see a schoolmate of his . He liked things so well in Texas that he just decided to make it his permanent address . In 4 years he went to the Congress . After he had been in the House 2 years , he became the Democratic leader , and he served a few years as Democratic leader . And he went to the Senate and he served in the Senate 4 years and he became the Democratic leader in the Senate . He served the district that Rayburn later served . When Rayburn came up as a young boy of the House , he went over to see the old Senator , the leader , one evening , who had come from this Southern State , and he was talking about economic problems . He was talking about how we had been at the mercy of certain economic interests , and how they had exploited us . They had worked our women for 5 cents an hour , they had worked our men for a dollar a day , they had exploited our soil , they had let our resources go to waste , they had taken everything out of the ground they could , and they had shipped it to other sections . He was talking about the economy and what a great future we could have in the South , if we could just meet our economic problems , if we could just take a look at the resources of the South and develop them . And he said , Sammy , I wish I felt a little better . I would like to go back to old and I will not call the name of the State it was not Louisiana and it was not Texas I would like to go back down there and make them one more Democratic speech . I just feel like I have one in me . The poor old State , they have not heard a Democratic speech in 30 years . All they ever hear at election time is Negro , Negro , Negro So we have the law of the land , and we are going to appeal to all Americans that fight in uniform and work in factory and on the farm to try to conduct themselves as Americans . Equal opportunity for all , special privileges for none , because there is only one real big problem that faces you . It is not even the economic problem and it is not the Negro problem . The only problem that faces you is whether you are going to live or die , and whether your family is going to live or die . I sat through 37 meetings of the National Security Council during the Cuban crisis . I never left home in the morning but what I realized I might not ever see her again that day . She might not be there or I might not be there . I sat at that table with the most trained generals and admirals we had , with four and five stars , and their war maps were out , and they took us from this stage to that stage , and we had our fleet moving , and we had our planes in the sky , and we had them loaded with our bombs . And we knew they had their missiles pointing at us . And the coolest man in that room , whose thumb was sitting there that could be put on the button , was the Commander in Chief , John Fitzgerald Kennedy , who had been abused all over that country . He is not here to defend himself , but I say shame on you that in his absence would attribute to him unworthy motives . At Oak Ridge we have developed the mightiest , most awesome power that human ingenuity could contemplate or conceive . By a thumb on a button you can wipe out 300 million lives in a matter of moments . And this is no time and no hour and no day to be rattling your rockets around . Or clicking your heels like a storm trooper . I say that because this is a moment when all nations must look all ways to try to find some ways and means to learn to live together without destroying each other . I have no reference to any nation , any country , or any individual . I just say that when you look at history , and you see what has happened to us in our lifetime , we have gone through two wars , and then you see what the next war could bring us , it is no time to preach division or hate . If there ever was a time for us to try to unite and find areas of agreement , it is now . We are the mightiest nation in all the world , but that power must be used to prevent a war , instead of starting one . I do not want to imply that there is any man in my party that wants to start one or anyone in any other party that wants to start one . I think the Republicans are just as patriotic as the Democrats . And I have not met any man that I know that I think wants to involve this country in any danger that he can avoid . I just say it is time for all of us to put on our thinking caps . It is time for all of us to follow the Golden Rule . It is time for all of us to have a little trust and a little faith in each other , and to try to find some areas that we can agree on so we can have a united program . I told you about the support that Vandenberg gave Truman in Greece and Turkey , about the support that I gave Eisenhower , Republican and Democrat , about the support that President Kennedy received in the Cuban missile crisis . And this is an hour when we must not become so bitter or so divided or hate each other so much in an election period that we will let the other nations think we are divided . The Kaiser thought we were divided and would not go to war and he sank the Lusitania and we became involved . Hitler thought we were divided because a few Senators were preaching isolationism and talking about munitions makers and he thought that he could take a part of the world and we would sit there in our rocking chairs and do nothing about it . And he got fooled . Let no would be conqueror ever mistake Uncle Sam . We do not seek any wars . But we are prepared and ready and willing to defend our freedom . And we are not about to yield it or sacrifice it or whittle it away to anybody . The election is coming up November the 3d . You have your choice . You have two parties . You have two tickets . You have men on both tickets who are experienced in the Congress , who served there many years . You do not have to have anybody come down here and tell you what is right . You do not have to have anybody come down here and tell you what you ought to do . You know what is best for you , and you go do it . And I am not even going to make a recommendation to you . If you think in your own heart that the course of wisdom for your country is this course , then you follow whatever you think it is . Because I believe that every other man is actuated by the same motives that I think I am actuated by . He wants to do what is right . I have never seen a man in Congress that I thought went there on a platform of doing what is wrong . He wants to do what is right . And I know the people of Louisiana want to do what is right . And I hope if you do what you think is right , that somehow or other it is the same thing that I think is right . But if it is not , I will not question your patriotism , I will not question your Americanism , I will not question your ancestry . I may quietly in the sanctity of our bedroom whisper to Lady Bird my own personal opinion about your judgment .<speech_sep>Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . The situation in the Dominican Republic continues to be serious . That is why we welcome the additional efforts which are being made in the OAS today to enlarge and to strengthen the efforts to find a peaceful settlement there . We continue to give our full support to Secretary General Mora 1 in his outstanding service under existing OAS resolutions , but we share his judgment that a very strong and sustained effort is going to continue to be needed . Meanwhile , I have been advised today by General Alvim , the Commander in Chief of the Inter American Force , and by Lieutenant General Palmer , the Deputy Commander of the Inter American Force , that conditions in the Dominican Republic will now permit the further withdrawal of the United States military personnel from the Inter American Force . This recommendation has the concurrence of Secretary General Mora and Ambassador Bennett . I am , therefore , accordingly , ordering the immediate withdrawal of one battalion landing team of United States Marines , plus headquarters and supporting personnel . This will total approximately 2 , 000 people . Now to another subject . This month of June marks a very historic anniversary in the affairs of man . Twenty years ago , while war still raged in the world , the nations of Europe assembled at San Francisco to sign the charter of hope that brought into being the United Nations . Men were mindful that in these times humankind must choose between cooperation or catastrophe . At San Francisco there was brought into being a great instrumentality for international cooperation , and we can believe today that the cooperation engendered by the United Nations has helped to avert catastrophe in this century . So today we have to work not on the things that divide us , but instead on the things that unite nations in the bonds of common interest . On June 24th , 25th , and 26th of this year , the General Assembly of the United Nations will meet for commemorative sessions in San Francisco . It is my hope and plan at this time to be in San Francisco and to address the delegates at that time during the meetings of the sessions there . This afternoon I am sending to the Congress a very special message requesting an additional appropriation to help in the peaceful economic and social development of southeast Asia . This is another forward step toward carrying out my April proposal for a massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict torn corner of the world . The American people , I think , want their own Government to be not only strong but compassionate . They know that a society is secure only when there is full social justice for all of its people , and these principles of compassion and justice never stop at the water s edge . So we do not intend that the enemies of freedom shall become the inheritors of man s worldwide revolt against injustice and misery . Therefore , we expect to lead in that struggle , not to conquer or to subdue , but to give each people the chance to build its own nation in its own way . My personal representative , Eugene Black , has already begun extensive and hopeful discussions with interested parties around the world . Thus , the groundwork has already been laid for a long range development plan for all of southeast Asia , led by Asians , to improve the life of Asians . In South Viet Nam today , brave and enduring people are carrying on a determined resistance against those who would destroy their independence . They will win this fight , and the United States of America is going to help them win it . But there is another and a much more profound struggle going on in that country , and that is the struggle to create the conditions of hope and progress which are really the only lasting guarantees of peace and stability . The 16 million people of South Viet Nam survive on an average income of 100 per year . More than 60 percent of the people have never learned to read or write . When disease strikes , medical care is often impossible to find . As I remarked the other day here , there is only one doctor for every 29 , 000 people , compared with one for every 740 in the United States . They have 200 doctors whereas , they need 5 , 000 . This poverty and this neglect take their inevitable toll in human life . The life expectancy there is only 35 years . That is just about half what it is in our country . Now , we think that these are the common enemies of man in South Viet Nam . They were there before the aggressor struck . They , of course , will be there when aggression is completely gone . These enemies , too , we are committed to help defeat . Today s request will be used to help develop the vast water and power resources of the Mekong basin . They will be used to bring electricity to small towns in the provinces . We have had REA teams , as you know , there working for several weeks making these surveys and planning to build several REA systems . We will build clinics and provide doctors for disease ridden rural areas . We will help South Viet Nam import materials for their homes and their factories , and in addition , the members of the American Medical Association have already agreed with us to try to recruit surgeons and specialists , approximately 50 of them . We are particularly very much in need of plastic surgeons to go to Viet Nam to help heal the wounds of war and to help them , as well , to deal with the ravages of unchecked disease . Now , this is just a part of the beginning . This appropriation today calls for only 89 million , but in the future I will call upon our people to make further sacrifices because this is a good program , and the starts that we are making today are good starts . This is the only way that I know in which we can really win not only the military battle against aggression , but the wider war for the freedom and for progress of all men . Now I will be glad to take any questions you may have . Yes . I think that we are very delighted that for the first time in history , we have presently on the military side an Inter American Force that is functioning and functioning effectively under the leadership of General Alvim in the Dominican Republic . A good many of the nations in this hemisphere are supplying forces to that Inter American Force , and others will be making contributions , we hope , in the next few days . On the political side , we are now considering the Organization of American States certain solutions for the Dominican Republic which could very well serve as an indication of what might come in similar situations down the road . We have had very enlightened and very positive leadership under Mora , the Secretary General of the OAin the Dominican Republic , and we hope not only can they supply forces to help provide the military answer to the necessities in that field , but that they can evolve a formula that will provide judicious determinations in connection with political judgments that we need to make in the near future . United States . EFFORTS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Yes , I will be very glad to . We found it necessary , in order to preserve our own citizens lives , and in order to stop the wholesale killing of hundreds and even thousands of Dominicans , to intervene in the Dominican Republic . Since that time , we have counseled at great length and sought the assistance of the OAS in connection with contributing the military forces that would bring about a cease fire and preserve the peace . At the same time , we have urged the OAS to establish machinery to help find a political solution , and awaiting the establishment of that machinery , which we are really considering in the OAS today , we have sent some of the best people in this Government to maintain contacts with the broad base of leadership in the Dominican Republic in the hope that there would , in due time , evolve a broadly based government that would meet with the approval of the Dominican people . I have had Vance , Bundy , Mann , Vaughn , 6 and others maintain liaison with various leaders of various groups there . Those conferences have been taking place from day to day and we have been keeping the OAS and their representatives fully informed . We are hopeful that in due time they will reach conclusions as to how they think it can be best handled and that we will be able to contribute our part and cooperate with them . As you know , they were discussing the matter over the weekend and today , and we hope that a decision will be in the offing in the immediate future . We have no desire to insist upon our particular brand of military solution or political solution . We think it is an inter American matter , and we want to cooperate fully with them . Prior to our intervention , we consulted and discussed the gravity of the situation there with 14 Latin American nations , beginning on Saturday when the revolution took place , up through Wednesday when we sent the Marines in . During that same period , we met with the Peace Committee of the OAS on Tuesday , and we met with the OAS Council on Wednesday . It has been our desire all along to contribute all we could to a cease fire , to the eventual evolution of a stable government that would be broadly based , and to make our appropriate contribution to the necessary reconstruction of that country . We feel that when the OAS reaches its decision , that that decision will be communicated to the people of the Dominican Republic . We hope that they will be able to find agreement between the inter American body and the folks there that will ultimately lead to an expression of opinion by the people of the Dominican Republic and ultimately lead to a broadly based government that will include none of the extremes . I think that is a matter not for the President to determine . No , I do not think so . I think it may have had that objective in mind . That may have been its purpose . But you know the old story when a man gets in the role of a mediator , both sides usually hit at him . But we think , as I said in my opening statement , that the Secretary General has performed a very useful role , a very intelligent one , and a very objective one , and we have every confidence in his efforts . We have regretted to see the attacks come upon him as we have regretted to see the attacks come upon us . But we much prefer the attacks to what could have happened except for our action and except for his action . I will answer the latter question first . I think that this administration profits from the suggestions and recommendations of leaders in other branches of government , from men who occupy public platforms , from general discussions . I think that is the strength of the American system , instead of a weakness . I am hopeful that every person will always exercise the free speech that the Constitution guarantees him , and I would prefer , of course , that it be constructive and it be responsible , and I think generally that has been true . I am glad that I live in a nation where , in the midst of conflict , when men are dying to preserve our freedom , that our citizens still do not fear to exercise it , and I can assure you that they do exercise it . We had anticipated that we would have some actions of this type at this season of the year . We have had a rather serious engagement in the last few hours , in the most immediate past . The South Vietnamese have lost , according to the reports we have , dozens , even hundreds , of people . We do not know exactly the extent of the Viet Cong losses , although we believe them to be substantial . We do not announce those , perhaps unfortunately , along with the announcement of our own losses . We know how many we lose , but we do not know how many they lose until we get out there and count them , so their losses never really catch up with the original story of our losses . Suffice it to say I think it has been serious . We are concerned about it . It is occupying our attention . As you know , General Taylor plans to be here in the next few days and he will probably have more definite information at that time , just about the details of this particular engagement . Oh , no . If you want me to elaborate on that a little bit , I will say that the threat was greater before 21 , 000 Americans arrived there . It always is . The Communists did not , in our judgment , originate this revolution , but they joined it and South Viet Nam . they participated in it . They were active in it , and in a good many places they were in charge of it . We think that following the action that this Nation took it served a very good purpose and some of the men who had originally participated in the revolution , and had to take asylum , returned , and more moderate forces took leadership the Communist elements have not been so active , although their presence is still noted hour by hour . Their effectiveness is still observed . From day to day we see their handiwork in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere throughout the world , particularly in the propaganda field . I would not want to anticipate what action the OAS is going to take . The President does not take action in connection with constitutional amendments . I have reviewed some of the proposals that have been made . I am generally sympathetic with the reapportionments taking place throughout the country in compliance with the Supreme Court s decision . I would not want to get into detailed discussion of the individual programs about which the President will not act one way or the other , because a constitutional amendment does not require White House action . It is a matter for the representatives of the people to decide . In submitting it , the Congress takes that action . The people themselves have an opportunity to judge it . When the Congress does get down to debating the question and considering it , I will , of course , spend some time on it and become thoroughly conversant with it , but I would not want to predict at this time just what measure would emerge in the form of an amendment or what action Congress or the people might take on it . No . I do not see that I can do you any good , the country any good , or myself any good by discussing future operational plans . I know of no real reason why we ought to photograph them or decide them until we are confronted with that possibility . I do not . No . I am afraid that the people that have branded the Johnson doctrine were unfamiliar with the fact that the nations of this hemisphere have repeatedly made it clear that the principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of the inter American system , just as President Kennedy made it abundantly clear . That is the basis of our own attitude on the matter , as I explained in my television appearance . That does not mean , of course , that this Government is opposed to change . The greatest purpose of the Alliance for Progress , which we are working on so hard and making such substantial contributions to , is to encourage economic and social change . We believe that will benefit all the people of this hemisphere . We are doing our best to provide encouragement for those changes . But I think it is a well known and well advertised doctrine of the hemisphere that the principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of our inter American system . President Kennedy enunciated that on several occasions . The OAS itself has enunciated that . I merely repeated it . I am sorry I got some folks excited by it . I will answer your first one . I do not want to get into personalities . Go ahead . We have taken several steps in the order of priority that we felt was required . Many months ago we became aware of the increasing tensions there , and the difficulties that would likely confront us . On the Sunday before we went in there on Wednesday , we asked the Ambassador , who had already come to Washington at our calling , to leave his family s home and come here to meet with us . Ambassador Bennett met with us on Monday . We rushed him back to the Dominican Republic and set in motion certain steps . First , was to attempt to obtain a cease fire . Second , was to take the precautionary steps necessary to protect approximately 5 , 000 Americans , as well as thousands of other nationals , if that should be required . We moved our ships up there on Sunday . The Ambassador arrived there on Monday . He talked to various leaders . We did all we could to bring about a cease fire in cooperation with the Papal Nuncio and others who were active on the scene . On Wednesday at noon it became apparent that danger was lurking around the corner and the Ambassador gave us a warning in a cable about 1 of the clock . We had met on Monday and we had met on Tuesday . We had met on Wednesday and we had had many conversations on Sunday that we did not issue any handouts on . During that period , I think from the time we were notified on Saturday , until we intervened on Wednesday , we spent a good part of both day and night giving our attention to this matter , from moving the ships up to making the final decision . I had 237 individual conversations during that period and about 35 meetings with various people . Finally , on Wednesday afternoon at 4 something , we got another warning that we should have a contingent plan ready immediately , and a little before 6 of the clock we got a plea , a unanimous plea from the entire country team , made up of the Ambassador , the AID Director , CIA and the USIand the Army , Navy , and the Air Force , to land troops immediately to save American lives . Now , of course , we knew of the forces at work in the Dominican Republic . We were not unaware that there were Communists that were active in this effort , but 99 percent of our reason for going in there was to try to provide protection for these American lives and for the lives of other nationals . We asked our Ambassador to summon all our people immediately to the Ambassador Hotel , to put them in one central group . In the presence of Secretary Rusk , Secretary McNamara , Secretary Ball , 10 Bundy , and Moyers11 of my staff , we consulted with the Latin American desk , Vaughn and his experts , and Vance and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . In the neighborhood of 6 of the clock Wednesday evening we made the decision , it was a unanimous decision , about which there was no difference of opinion either at the Dominican Republic level , or the country team , or the Cabinet level here , to send in the troops . We did not want to announce that they were on their way until they had landed , for obvious security reasons . But when I made the decision , I pointed out to the Secretary of State that we had been consulting since the weekend with some 14 Latin American nations , that we had had a meeting of the Peace Committee of the OAand we had had a meeting of the Council of the OAI thought it was very important that we notify all the Latin American Ambassadors forthwith . So the decision was to notify the Congress and ask them to come down so we could review with them developments , notify the Ambassadors , and ask for an immediate session of the OAand to notify the troops , because the lives of our citizens were in danger . Men were running up and down the corridors of the Ambassador Hotel with tommy guns , shooting out windows , and through the roof and through the closets . Our citizens were under the beds and in the closets and trying to dodge this gunfire . Our Ambassador , as he was talking to us , was under the desk . We did not think we had much time to consult in any great detail more than we had talked about up to that time , but we did make the announcement about 8 of the clock and immediately asked the OAS for an urgent meeting the next morning . Since that time we have had two purposes in mind One was for them to take action that would give us a military presence and provide a military solution so that we could quit killing people . I think that the Armed Forces are entitled to one of the greatest tributes ever paid that group in war or peace for the marvelous operation they conducted . They moved in there and landed within an hour from the time the Commander in Chief made the decision . They surrounded the hotel and protected the lives of a thousand American citizens and many hundreds of other nationals . They did not lose one civilian . They opened the route of 7 miles to the port and they evacuated 5 , 600 people . Those people came from 46 different countries . The next step that we thought should be followed was to provide food and clothing and sustenance for those people , so we sent an economic team of 32 people , headed by Solomon , 12 who was sworn in today as Assistant Under Secretary of State in charge of economic matters . And we started feeding the 3 million people of the Dominican Republic . We have provided food and other necessities , medicine , since that time , to those people without regard to which side they were on . In addition , we have treated more than 15 , 000 with our medical facilities . So having gone in and secured the place , having evacuated 5 , 600 people , and now the commercial planes are running and they can come out on their own stint , having obtained a cease fire , having provided the economic aid , having sent our best people there to talk to all groups and all factions and leadership , to try to find a government that would appeal to all the Dominican people , we now think that there are two essential things that are left to be done One is to find a broadly based government under the leadership of the OAS that will be acceptable and approved by the Dominican people and second , to engage in the comprehensive task of reconstruction of that nation , in trying to make it possible for 3 1 2 million to have an economic comeback . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Peace is the number 1 subject in the mind of every leader in the Government . We are searching for it a part of every day . We think that the people of South Vietnam have demonstrated that they want to be governed on the basis of one man one vote , and people who are prepared to live under that kind of an arrangement could live under that kind of arrangement . The thing that we must recognize about peace is that it is much more than just wishing for it . You cannot get it just because you want it . If that were true , we would have had it a long time ago , because there are no people in the world who want peace more than the President , the Cabinet , and the people of the United States . But if we are to find the solution of uniting the people of South Vietnam , and solving the problems in South Vietnam , it must be done not by some Senator , or Congressman Ryan , or Senator Hartke , or Senator Fulbright , or some of our best intentioned people who want peace , This peace is going to be found by the leadership of South Vietnam , the people of South Vietnam , in South Vietnam . We are encouraging that . We are going to continue to do our dead level best to see this constitutional government , where 70 percent of their people registered and 60 percent of their people voted , develop some kind of a plan that we think will ultimately unite South Vietnam and bring peace to that area . This will take time . This will take patience . This will take understanding . The great problem we have is not misleading the enemy and letting him think because of some of the statements he hears coming from us that the way is cheap , or that it is easy , or that we are going to falter . I have just explained what I thought would be a fair solution . I will repeat it as briefly and as succinctly as I can . The demilitarized zone must be respected as the 1954 agreements require . The unity of Vietnam as a whole must be a matter for peaceful adjustment and negotiation . The North Vietnamese forces must get out of Laos and stop infiltrating Laos . That is what the 1962 agreement required , and it must be respected . The overwhelming majority of the people of South Vietnam want a one man one vote constitutional government . About 70 percent of all the citizens who might have voted in South Vietnam registered in the election , and 60 percent of them voted . The 20 percent or so of the population now under Vietcong control must live under a one man one vote constitutional system if there is to be peace . President Thieu has said that the South Vietnamese Government is not prepared to recognize the NLF as a government , and it knows well that NLF s control is by Hanoi . And so do we . But he also has said that he is prepared for informal talks with members of the NLand that these could bring good results . I think that is a statesmanlike position . And I hope the other side will respond . That is why or statement in early December said we believe that the South Vietnamese must work out their own future , acting through electoral processes of the kind carried forward in the last 2 years . The political future of South Vietnam , Scherer , must be worked out in South Vietnam by the people of South Vietnam . It is our judgment that this war could be ended in a matter of weeks if the other side would face these five simple facts , and if some of our own people here in this country would encourage that that be done instead of broadcasting alarms that may give false signals both to Hanoi and to the Vietcong . I think that the thing we must bear in mind , that what happens in South Vietnam is up to the people of South Vietnam , not to North Vietnam , not to China , the Soviet Union , or the United States but the people of South Vietnam . We are prepared to have every man in South Vietnam under their constitutional government , one man one vote for those people themselves to determine the kind of government they want . We think we know what that determination would be from the 70 percent who are registered and the 60 percent who have voted . It is a matter for them to determine . I think that we might add one other thing here When Reynolds says what are the minimum conditions for this or that , we do not want to get sparring with each other . But I can say that so far as the United States is concerned , we are ready to stop fighting tonight if they are ready to stop fighting . But we are not ready to stop our side of the war only to encourage them to escalate their side of the war . We will reciprocate and meet any move that they make , but we are not going to be so softheaded and pudding headed as to say that we will stop our half of the war and hope and pray that they stop theirs . Now , we have tried that in some instances . We have leaned over backwards . Every time we have , they have escalated their efforts and they have killed our soldiers . We have got no result from it . A burnt child dreads the fire . But if you want us to stop our bombing , you have to ask them to stop their bombing , stop their hand grenades , stop their mortars . At San Antonio I laid out the formula and I said we will stop bombing immediately provided you will have prompt and productive discussions . Now , that is about as far as anyone can go . That is as far as anyone should go . That is as far as we are going . Well , it is my feeling that our position in the world is very clearly known . If it is not , I have tried to repeat it enough tonight that the people can understand it . I think that Hanoi feels that if they can hold out long enough , that they will not win a military victory against General Westmoreland . They have not done that . They cannot point to one single victory they won from our Marines , or from our Air , or from our Navy , or from our Army . They think , though , that they can repeat what happened to them with the French that if their will is strong and they continue to remain firm , that they will develop enough sympathy and understanding in this country , and hatred for war in this country , that their will will outlast our will . I do not think that is true . I think in due time , if our people will understand and recognize what is happening , I think they will help me prove it is not true . Yes , I have said that I think the war could be stopped in a matter of days if President Thieu s suggestions that he informally talk with members of the NLF are carried out and if they would agree to what they have already agreed to in the 1954 accords and the 1962 accords and the other points that I mentioned this morning , like one man one vote under the present constitutional government . I think that would be a useful starting point . And I think the result could be that we could find a way to stop the war . They could have informal talks with them , Dan . I said that the President had made clear that he would not recognize NLbut we have made dear for many , many months that their views can be heard and we can respond to them their recommendations can be received and we can react to them . President Thieu , himself , in a very statesmanlike manner , has said that he would be agreeable to having informal talks with their representatives . We would hope that out of that some understanding could be reached . I believe if it could be reached , the war could be brought to a close . Well , it was one of many statements , if you will look back upon it , as a part of a policy , namely , our policy then and now was to keep our hand out for negotiations and for discussions , and for peace , and our guard up that would support the South Vietnamese to keep them from being enveloped . We made clear all through that campaign , and in this speech which you have extracted one little single sentence out of , that we felt that the South Vietnamese ought to pledge every resource they had their men , their materials , all of their resources to defending themselves that we would never supplant them . But we would supplement them to the extent that it was necessary . We did not plan to go into Asia and to fight an Asian war that Asians ought to be fighting for themselves . But if Asians were fighting it for themselves and were using all the resources that they had in South Vietnam , there was no pledge , no commitment , or no implication that we would not supplement them and support them as we are doing , and as we agreed to do many years before in the SEATO Treaty , and as we had agreed to do in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution before that statement . That has just been a part of the politicians gambit of picking out one sentence before you get to the but in it , and say , We are not going to take over all the fighting and do it ourselves . We are not going to do what Asian boys in South Vietnam should do . They are doing it . They have over 700 , 000 men there out of 17 million population , and they are raising another 65 , 000 compared to the additional 40 , 000 odd that we are sending . So we do not plan to supplant them at all . But we do plan to supplement them to whatever is necessary to keep the Communist conspiracy from gobbling up that nation . I do not think that all people do everything alike . I know some television broadcasters are better than others . I know some Presidents that can perform in a conversation better than others . General Abrams , who is giving leadership to the South Vietnamese people , thinks that their army is developing very well . Now , that is not to say that they are equal to the best troops of every other nation , but they have made great improvements . They are working at their job . They still have some problems to correct in leadership . That is what really determines what kind of a fighting force you have . But they are getting at it and they are getting results . It is mighty easy to blame someone else . That is what we do . I do not think we get much out of blaming our allies or talking about how much better we are than they . Most of the people out there tell us that they believe that the South Vietnamese Army at this time is equal to the Korean troops in 1954 . If they are , I do not think we will have to apologize too much for them . They are taking up their positions on the DMZ now . They have been giving very good results from their actions . General Abrams thinks they are doing all right . I would prefer his judgment to anybody s judgment and I know . Without going into your statements as to my views , I would say this We are not sure just at this point of all that motivates the Chinese , or the Russians , or any of the other Communists who are supporting the North Vietnamese . I do not think I could honestly tell you just what their motivations are . We have always hoped that they would like to see this war brought to an end . That has been their indication to us . Whether that would work out in the long run , I do not know . I think that the Glassboro conference was a very useful conference . I am not sure that it really solved any of the problems of the Middle East . I think the situation in the Middle East is a very dangerous one . I think we have made clear our viewpoint in my statement of June 19th , the five conditions that ought to enter into bringing about peace in that area . We stressed those to Kosygin at Glassboro . He understands them . He did not agree with them . But I think that the Soviet Union understands that we feel very strongly about this matter , that we do have definite views . I think Ambassador Goldberg , at the United Nations , has made our position very clear . As a result of the action of the United Nations , in sending Ambassador Jarring there as a mediator , we are hopeful that the conditions I outlined on June 19th can be worked out and that a permanent solution can be found to that very difficult problem . I would say it is one of our most dangerous situations , and one that is going to require the best tact , judgment , patience , and willingness on the part of all to find a solution . We do not have a SEATO Treaty , if that is what you are asking . We have made clear our very definite interest in Israel , and our desire to preserve peace in that area of the world by many means . But we do not have a mutual security treaty with them , as we do in Southeast Asia . Well , there are a good many things said , Reynolds , that people have to take with a grain of salt . First , they ought to look at the sources of these statements . I have tried to analyze our position in the world with other nations . We do regret that we do not see everything alike with the Soviet Union or other nations . We hope that there would not be this tension and these strains that frequently are in evidence . Now , we do not say that everything is 100 percent all right , because we have very definite and very strong differences of opinion and philosophy . But if you are asking me if the tension exists today that existed when the Berlin Wall went up , the answer is no . Now , we can understand the Soviet Union s inhibitions and the problems they have as long as Vietnam is taking place . They are called upon to support their Communist brother , and they are supporting him in a limited way with some equipment . We wish that were not so . We would hope that they would exercise their duties and their responsibilities as cochairmen and take some leadership and try to bring this war to an end . But we do not think that things are as tense , or as serious , or as dangerous as they were when the Berlin Wall went up , in the Cuban missile crisis , or following Kennedy s visit with Khrushchev at Vienna . I do not find that complaint in Europe . I find it in Georgetown among a few columnists generally . The European leaders we are having very frequent exchanges with them generally . Prime Minister Wilson will be here early in February . He has been here several times . We have been to Germany , and Kiesinger and ahead of him Erhard , and ahead of him Adenauer have been here . Many of the Scandinavian leaders have come here . The Dutch leaders have come here . This year in Europe we have had a very long agenda that has produced what we think are very excellent results . We have just concluded an agreement on the Kennedy Round , which involved very far reaching trade concessions . We think it will stand as a monument to the relationship of the people of Europe and the people of the United States , and very much to both of their advantages . We had a challenge of NATO and General de Gaulle asked us to get out of France . We sat down with the other 14 members of NATthe other European nations , and we looked at our problem . We decided that we would go to Belgium . Thirteen of those nations joined the United States and 14 of us went there . NATO is now intact , as solid as it can be , unified . Secretary Rusk has just returned from very successful meetings with them . So the challenge to NATO has been rebuffed . The difficulties of the Kennedy Round have been solved . The frequent predictions that the Germans would reduce their troop strength 60 , 000 and we would bring our divisions back from Europe those matters have been worked out . We are working feverishly every day trying to bring about a nonproliferation agreement and we are making headway . So I think , if you take the results of this year s efforts in Europe , that most European statesmen who have been engaged in those efforts would think we have been quite successful and probably more successful than any other period . And I do not see that we have either ignored them or neglected them . I would say that not all of it is changing . I would say that all through our history , as these changes occurred , there has been violence connected with them . We found that true in World War We found that true in World War IWe had a riot in Detroit during President Roosevelt s administration where he had to send out troops that compared very much to the same one we had there this year . We have this unrest . We have this uncertainty . We have this desire of people who have been held down all these years to rise up and try to acquire , quickly , what has been denied them so unjustly so long . We have more violence than we want , and more than we should have , more than we are going to be able to tolerate . But I do not think that represents all the country at all . I think that represents a very small minority . I think our big problem is to get at the causes of these riots . I think that some of the causes are the hope of the people themselves . They do not have jobs . They want jobs . So we are going to have to provide jobs . There are some half million unemployed , hard core unemployed , in our principal cities . We just have to go and find jobs for them . I am going to call in the businessmen of America and say one of two things has to happen You have to help me go out here and find jobs for these people , or we are going to have to find jobs in the Government for them and offer every one of them a job . I think that is one thing that could be done . I think that will have to be done , as expensive as it is . Second , I think we will have to do something about the housing situation . People live in filth , in dilapidated houses . More new housing ought to be built and has to be built . We have to find places to build that housing . I have tried to pass legislation that I thought would be helpful , such as the open housing bill . I have tried to encourage the Congress to take action on model cities and on rent supplements . We have made progress , although not as much as we would like . So , we are going to have to accelerate and step up rebuilding our cities so we can have decent housing . In the field of education , education has been denied to the poor on an equal basis for many years . The poor children have not had the advantages because of lack of transportation , because of the economic situation in their family , because of a lot of reasons their own health conditions . So , they have not had the education . And because of discrimination , they have not had the educational opportunities that the other children have had . So we are fast correcting those . We have tripled our education program in 3 years , and the poor have been the primary beneficiaries . We are spending three times as much on health today as we were 4 years ago , and the poor are the primary beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid . They can have their hospital bills paid now . They can have their doctors paid now . As a result , our infant mortality rate is going down . As a result , our death rate is going down . We have made great progress with health and education . They are important things . So I would say jobs , health , education , and housing are all contributing to this general dissatisfaction that results in violence on occasions , and we have to accelerate our efforts there . We have to appeal to these people to keep their feelings within bounds and keep them lawful , because every person in this country must obey the law of this country , and there is no situation that justifies your violating the law . I told you the reasons why because revolting and violence are unlawful . It is not going to be allowed . It does not solve the problem . It is not the answer to the conditions that exist . The answer is jobs . The answer is education . The answer is health . Now , if we refuse to give those answers , people are going to lose hope , and when they do , it is pretty difficult to get them to be as reasonable as we think they should be . But there is every reason why they should not . Violence is not going to produce more jobs . Violence is not going to produce more education . Violating the law and taking the law into your own hands is not going to produce better health or better housing . It is going to produce anarchy . And that cannot be tolerated . I do not agree with the extremists and I hope you do not . I have outlined that jobs , housing , education , health all of these things , trying to get at these problems . We think that if we can have a program for the cities , like model cities , we think if we can have jobs , like neighborhood youth training and the job program we are working out , if we can find employment for all the hard core we think that this will answer some of the causes of the riots . You know what my reaction to it is . What is your answer to it , Frank What is your answer , though , Frank If not , what What is your solution What do you recommend You are not going to answer it now You are not going to give us your recommendations or your thoughts That is what we are doing . We accept your recommendation and we will carry it out . We hope that the Congress will , as these things develop , see the need of them . We think we have made progress . We could not get the model cities program authorized and funded 2 years ago , but we did this year . We could not get rent supplements authorized and funded , but we have this year . We could not get the housing programs that we have underway now authorized and funded 2 years ago , but we have this year . We are making progress . We cannot correct it overnight . You cannot take the errors of 100 years and solve them in 100 days . We would like to do as much as we can . I am recommending a good deal more than the Congress is willing to do . In the poverty field I recommended and urged , and asked every Cabinet member to join us in doing so we urged the Congress to provide 2 . 2 billion in funds for poverty . They cut it several hundred million dollars . We have made recommendations for 40 , 000 rent supplement units , 40 million . They cut it to 10 million . I regret it . If I could issue an Executive order and vitiate it , and put nay own program into effect , I would do it . But we are moving in that direction . And we are going to do all we can to accelerate it and to escalate it . Yes , I sense it . I think we have that condition . And we are trying to meet it as best we know how . I have seen it several times in my lifetime . I remember the days of the zoot suiters in World War II remember the doubters who thought all of our youth were going to the dogs because of the sit down movements in some of the plants in our country at certain periods of our country . I remember the doubt expressed about our ability in World War II to take a bunch of beardless boys and resist Hitler s legions . There have been some disappointments . But I have visited the campuses of this country . My Cabinet has gone and met with the young people of this country . We deal with young folks every day in the Peace Corps , in the poverty program , in the VISTA program , and in the job camps . And I think it is a very small percentage that have given up , who have lost faith , who have deep questions about the future of the country and of themselves . We have more than 3 million young people serving in uniform . I hear from about 100 of them every day . They do not get the attention that you television people give these exhibitionists . They do not have anyone to make signs for them and parade , get their pictures in the papers . They are just there from daylight to dark , fighting for freedom and liberty , and willing to die for it . They are a pretty large number , comparatively speaking . I doubt that there is anything like that many hippies , or I doubt that there are that many disillusioned people . If you added them all up and put them in one unit , I think that they would make a very small percentage . And I think anyone who thinks the youth of the country is going to the dogs , or implies it , better take another look at it . I have just gone through two weddings this year , and I have been associated with a lot of young people . And the kind of young people I see , whom I hear , who write me , are not the little group that you all can ferret out up here at some park or some place that have nothing to do but carry a sign around on their shoulders and try to obstruct someone else from getting to a place or try to howl them down after they get there . I think we have young people who are terribly upset at what is going on . I know they hate war . We all hate war . But I think there is a very small percent who are going to take these extreme means and going to employ these extreme ways to express this lack of confidence in their future and in their country . Yes , and do . Yes . I think there has been a very subtle effort made by a few politicians to suggest that it would be difficult for the President to travel it would be very dangerous . Probably the wish was father to the thought . I think there has been some indication that certain organized groups would try to bring embarrassment to the Secretary of State by not letting him talk , or to the Vice President by interrupting his talk . But every time that has happened and it has been encouraged some by some of the political groups , because we have followed them and have seen that that has happened the people have been resounding in their disapproval . While we all recognize dissent , and we expect it , and we treat it respectfully , we listen to it , we do not think that dissent should be turned into hooliganism , and we do not think because a person has a right to dissent that as a great Justice one time said you have a right to holier fire in a crowded theater , or that you have the right to tear a speaker s necktie off , or to put your hand over his mouth and prevent him from speaking . We think the dissent should be within the law , and within the Constitution . We respect it when it is . But if they are going to use storm trooper tactics , it will be dealt with and will be dealt with properly . If they are going to encourage folks to bring bodily harm to a President , or to any other official , that is sinking very low , and we do not think the people want to hear much like that , either over the television in the form of suggestion , or by some who are sent to these campuses to incite folks . You see them on every campus , on your television every night . They are representatives of various groups . I do not want to get personal and I do not want to give them advertisement , but if you are interested just turn on ABC tonight and look at the newscast . A good part of every newscast you have will have some of these folks who are encouraging the dissent , appealing to them . They will be parading . They will have their signs . They will be charging us with murder , and this and that , because we are trying to carry out our obligations and our treaty commitments and protect that flag . No , I did not say that . I said they report it . And if you want to see it , it is there for you to see it . I did not say anything about disproportionate . Well , I think that is a matter for your judgment . I do not think it is up to the President to be making up your newscasts . Well , in the first place , I am not in the business of recommending their program for them . I have enough problems with my own program . But we do have a way of people in this country expressing their viewpoint , giving out interviews , making speeches , having picketing . I would say generally speaking , Rather , being lawful , abiding by the law of the land , doing whatever the law will permit them to do . I do not think you have to be a law violator in the name of the first amendment . I do not think you are justified in being a law violator in order to have your right of free speech . I think that the people who ought to want to follow the law and the Constitution the most are the dissenters themselves , because it is that law and that Constitution which gives them their right to dissent and protects that right . I am amazed that some of these so called liberal folks who reserve for themselves the right to speak long , loud , and freely , but when the opposition views are expressed , they try to drown it out with catcalls , eggs , or tomatoes . I do not understand that kind of behavior . I am not familiar with that . Who says that I do not think that is correct at all . We read the papers , we see the television , we read our correspondence . We spend a good deal more time on that than we do out viewing what he is saying or doing at the Pentagon . I have not done that , Ray . I think in due time I will cross that bridge . Until then , I do not want to speculate about it . Until I do that , I am not going to speculate about it . Well , I will do that when I leave it . I just do not know . I do not know what the effect of the Kennedy McCarthy movement is having in the country . I am not a reporter . I have not followed it . I am not privileged to all the conversations that may have taken place . I just observe they have had some meetings and some discussions . I do know of the interest of both of them in the Presidency and the ambition of both of them . I see that reflected from time to time . But just what they are prepared to do , how they are going to do it , whether they are going to do it in concert , or what will be the effect upon the American people of these maneuvering , I am not prepared to say . I believe that the French people have an understanding , an interest , and affection for the American people , and I think it is greatly reciprocated . I am sorry that the relationship between the President and de Gaulle is not a closer one and that we do not see matters alike any more often than we do . We have tried to do everything that we know to do to minimize the differences that exist in the leadership of the two governments . We strongly feel that the people of the two countries have a long history of friendship and we are determined to preserve that . We are also determined to minimize our differences and , from my part , to do nothing to unjustly or unduly provoke the French Government . I got precisely to the point . I do not want to do anything to accentuate , aggravate , or contribute to emphasizing the differences that we have and straining the relations . I think basically our people are friendly and I am going to do all I can to keep them friendly . I think you must have the trust of the people . I feel we do have the trust of the people . I do think we have the support of the people . The people in every election have had a chance to express themselves , in a national election , and have given us a majority vote . In 1964 , the last election , we got 61 percent of the votes , the highest percentage any President ever obtained . I am not talking about some individual poll . In the last congressional election , we had a majority in both House and Senate . Now we lost some of our majority . We lost some of our support . I do not think there is any question about that . In a preelection year you will always do that . We looked ahead of 1964 when they were having the San Francisco convention . I think a great many people toyed with the idea of joining or voting in the opposition party until they had the results of the convention , until they saw what would happen if you elected a Republican , and who would be brought into office , the kind of government you would have , and the kind of policies you would have . I think there is some uncertainty in the country . I think there is some division in the country . I do not think that the opposition is in the majority and I do not think they will be on election day . But I do not discount it , and I do not ignore it . I would hope that it would be a more knowledgeable world and a better educated world . There are four people out of every 10 today who cannot read cat , who cannot spell dog , who cannot recognize the printed word mother . I would like to see every boy and girl who is born in the world have all the education that he or she can take . We are making great gains in that direction in this country . I would like to see other nations make great gains . I would like to see an enlightened program of family planning available to all the peoples of the world . I would like to see the problem of food production faced up to and nations take the necessary steps to try to provide the food that they are going to need to support their populations . I would like to see the miracles of health extended to all the peoples of the world as they were to the fellow who was operated on with the heart change the other day . I know that the infant mortality rate is going down . I should like to see it reflected in all the 110 nations . In short , I believe that our ancient enemies are ignorance and illiteracy , are disease and bigotry . I would like to see my descendants grow up in a world that is as educated as possible , as healthy as science will permit , as prepared to feed itself , and which certainly has sufficient conservation forces to permit enjoyable leisure for the people who work long and late . And I think we are moving to that end . It is very hard to predict what is ahead . The Secretary of the Treasury and the Council of Economic Advisers , and the Budget Director have made the best statements that they could to the Ways and Means Committee . We think the business activity is going to pick up . We think there is going to be increased production . We think it is very essential that we have a tax bill . We look forward to continued prosperity . We have had 82 months of unparalleled prosperity in this country , longer than any other period , uninterrupted , and we want to keep things that way . We think the most important thing to us , from a domestic standpoint , is to provide more jobs , and we have added six million jobs in the last few years . We think that those jobs ought to have good pay , but that we should not increase our wages or our profits or our dividends , beyond what the increased productivity justifies , so that we can maintain some restraint on prices . And while we are not satisfied with the job we have done , we have done a better job than any other country and we are urging both business and labor to take that into consideration in their negotiations with each other . I have said to them in several public statements that we hope that they can conduct themselves in such a way as will permit them to join the family of nations and that we can learn to live in harmony with each other . We have no desire to be enemies of any nation in the world . We believe that it is possible , over the years , for them to develop a better understanding of the world in which they live . We think there are some very important things taking place right in China today that will contribute to , we hope , a better understanding and a more moderate approach to their neighbors in the world . We have observed their failures in Africa , and in Latin America , and in Southeast Asia , where they have undertaken aggressive steps that have resulted in failure for them . And we hope they will profit by these experiences . We believe they will . We do not know all that we would like to know about what is going on in China . It is a rather closed society and we do not have all the information that we would like to have . But we are hopeful and we believe that over a period of time , that the opportunity exists for them to gain a better understanding of the other peoples of the world and thus be able to live more harmoniously with them . No . I can only repeat what Secretary McNamara said and what I have said . Secretary McNamara has been Secretary of Defense longer than any other man . I think he has been the best Secretary of Defense that we have ever had . I hate to see him leave as Secretary of Defense . I take great satisfaction in the contribution that McNamara has made to the Government . He is only on sabbatical leave . He is not going to be very far away from here . And on anything that is remotely connected with the best interests of the world , that the World Bank is interested in , we will be working very close together . I do not consider that I have lost his services , or the world has lost his talents , or that I have lost a friend in any way . I think that instead of building a great machine at the Pentagon for the purpose of defending liberty and freedom , that he will be busy at the World Bank in the constructive purpose of building the economies and bettering humanity in these very nations that we are trying to defend . And I took forward with a great deal of pleasure to working very closely with him . We will have detailed recommendations in our State of the Union in connection with the problems the Nation faces . There are many unresolved problems . There will be substantial recommendations to the next Congress . There have been substantial achievements in this one . We did not get everything we wanted at all . We never have . But we had a good Congress . We did not have as good a Congress as we had in the 89th Congress . We did not pass as many substantive measures and they did not reach as far as the others . They were curtailed some because that was the mood of the Congress . And on a good many measures they were able to reduce our proposals . They did not destroy model cities . They crippled it . They cut it by several hundred million . They did not destroy rent supplements , but they cut it from 40 million to 10 million . They did not destroy the rat bill . They knocked it out for a while and staggered it , but after the Senate worked on it , we approved it . They did not recommit a good many of the bills , but they reduced them . They did not wipe out poverty , but they reduced it from 2 . 2 billion several hundred million to 1 . 7 billion something . So those are the things that you have to face up to . I am not saying ugly things about the individuals . Those men think they are right . They do not want to take some of these new programs . They do not want to fund model cities , rent supplements , or face up to the urban requirements and what I think are 20th century requirements . And I understand their philosophy . I have understood it for 35 years . They frequently are the preservers of stagnation . And they want to keep things as they are . They do not want to move forward . Now , I came into the executive branch with a man who said , Let us get the country moving again . Now we have the country moving again and we want to keep it moving . We are going to keep it moving if we can get the Congress support . And while we did not get them to support us every time we wanted to , we did move forward and we hope the next session will be a productive one , too . I am going to appeal to every Republican in an election year to come in and do what is best for his country . And if he does that , without regard to how it might cripple the President , without regard to the politics of the year , then I think we will have a good Congress . I am going to do what I think is best for my country , at home and abroad , without regard to what effect it has on my future . And if they will do the same thing , we will have a good government , a good country , and then we can let the election take care of itself . And I think we will have a good election . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Chief Justice , Secretary , Senator Kennedy , Members of the fine delegation from New York , ladies and gentlemen at the head table , my fellow Americans To be honored with this award by this organization is a very proud moment for me . I accept it with the gratitude of my heart and with renewed commitment to the cause that it represents , the cause of freedom at home and the cause of freedom abroad . Twenty five years ago , to a world that was darkened by war , President Franklin Roosevelt described the four freedoms of mankind Freedom of speech and expression . Freedom of every person to worship God in his own way . Freedom from want . Freedom from fear . Franklin Roosevelt knew that these freedoms could not be the province of one people alone . He called on all his countrymen to assist those who endured the tyrant s bombs and suffered his opposition and oppression . He called for courage and for generosity , and for resolution in the face of terror . And then he said , Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere . Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them . Wendell Willkie , Franklin Roosevelt s opponent in the campaign of 1940 , shared his belief that freedom could not be founded only on American shores or only for those whose skin is white . Freedom is an indivisible word , Wendell Willkie said . If we want to enjoy it and fight for it we must be prepared to extend it to everyone , whether they are rich or poor , whether they agree with us or not , no matter what their race or the color of their skin . That was Republican policy 25 years ago . It was Democratic policy 25 years ago . It is Americana policy here tonight . Then how well have we done in our time in making the four freedoms real for our people and for the other people of the world Here in America we accord every man the right to worship as he wills . I believe we are more tolerant of sectional and religious and racial differences than we were a quarter of a century ago . The majority of our people believe that a qualified man or woman , of any race , of any religion , of any section , could hold any office in our land . This was not so not very dear at all in 1940 . We are committed now , however great the trial and tension , to protecting the right of free expression and peaceful dissent . We have learned to despise the witch hunt , the unprincipled harassment of a man s integrity and his right to be different . We have gained in tolerance , and I am determined to use the high office I hold to protect and to encourage that tolerance . I do not mean to say that I will remain altogether silent on the critical issues of our day . For just as strongly as I believe in other men s freedom to disagree , so do I also believe in the President s freedom to attempt to persuade . So let me assure you and my fellow Americans tonight that I will do everything in my power to defend both . Twenty five years ago freedom from want had the ring of urgency for our people . The unemployment rate stood at 14 . 5 percent . Millions of Americans had spent the last decade in the breadlines or on farms where the winds howled away any chance for a decent life . Tonight there are still millions whose poverty haunts our conscience . There are still fathers without jobs , and there are still children without hope . Yet for the vast majority of Americans these are times when the hand of plenty has replaced the grip of want . And for the first time in almost 9 years tonight the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 percent . This liberation from want for which we thank God is a testimony to the enduring vitality of the American competitive system , the American free enterprise economy . It is a testimony also to an enlightened public policy , established by Franklin Roosevelt and strengthened by every administration since his death . That policy has freed Americans for more hopeful and more productive lives . It has relieved their fears of growing old by social security and by medical care . It has inspired them with hope for their children by aid to elementary and higher education . It has helped to create economic opportunity by enlightened fiscal policies . It has granted to millions , born into hopelessness , the chance of a new start in life by public works , by private incentive , by poverty programs . For the Negro American , it has opened the door after centuries of enslavement and discrimination opened the doors to the blessings that America offers to those that are willing and able to earn them . Thus we address the spirit of Franklin Roosevelt , 25 years after his message to America and the world , with confidence and with an unflagging determination . We have served his vision of the four freedoms essential to mankind here in America . Yet we know that he did not speak only for America . We know that the four freedoms are not secure in America when they are violently denied elsewhere in the world . We know , too , that it requires more than speeches to resist the international enemies of freedom . We know that men respond to deeds when they are deaf to words . Even the precious word freedom may become empty to those without the means to use it . For what does freedom mean when famine chokes the land , when new millions crowd upon already strained resources , when narrow privilege is entrenched behind law and custom , when all conspires to teach men that they cannot change the condition of their lives I do not need to tell you how five administrations have labored to give real meaning to freedom , in a world where it is often merely a phrase that conceals oppression and neglect . Men in this room , men throughout America , have given their skills and their treasure to that work . You have warned our people how insatiable is aggression , and how it thrives on human misery . You have carried the word that without the sense that they can change the conditions of their lives , nothing can avail the oppressed of this earth neither good will , nor national sovereignty , nor massive grants of aid from their more fortunate brothers . You have known , too , that men who believe they can change their destinies will change their destinies . Armed with that belief , they will be willing yes , they will be eager to make the sacrifices that freedom demands . They will be anxious to shoulder the responsibilities that are inseparably bound to freedom . They will be able to look beyond the four essential freedoms beyond to the freedom to learn , to master new skills , to acquaint themselves with the lore of man and nature to the freedom to grow , to become the best that is within them to become , to cast off the yoke of discrimination and disease to the freedom to hope , and to build on that hope , lives of integrity and well being . This is what our struggle in Vietnam is all about tonight . This is what our struggle for equal rights in this country is all about tonight . We seek to create that climate , at home and abroad , where unlettered men can learn , where deprived children can grow , where hopeless millions can be inspired to change the terms of their existence for the better . That climate cannot be created where terror fills the air . Children cannot learn , and men cannot earn their bread , and women cannot heal the sick where the night of violence has blotted out the sun . Whether in the cities and hamlets of Vietnam , or in the ghettos of our own cities , the struggle is the same . That struggle is to end the violence against the human mind and body so that the work of peace may be done , and the fruits of freedom may be won . We are pitting the resources of the law , of education and training , of our vision and our compassion , against that violence here in America . And we shall end it in our time . On the other side of the earth we are no less committed to ending violence against men who are struggling tonight to be free . And it is about that commitment that I have come here to speak now . Tonight in Vietnam more than 200 , 000 of your young Americans stand there fighting for your freedom . Tonight our people are determined that these men shall have whatever help they need , and that their cause , which is our cause , shall be sustained . But in these last days there have been questions about what we are doing in Vietnam , and these questions have been answered loudly and clearly for every citizen to see and to hear . The strength of America can never be sapped by discussion , and we have no better nor stronger tradition than open debate , free debate , in hours of danger . We believe , with Macaulay , that men are never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss it freely . We are united in our commitment to free discussion . So also we are united in our determination that no foe anywhere should ever mistake our arguments for indecision , nor our debates for weakness . So what are the questions that are still being asked First , some ask if this is a war for unlimited objectives . The answer is plain . The answer is no . Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression . It is not conquest it is not empire it is not foreign bases it is not domination . It is , simply put , just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam . Second , some people ask if we are caught in a blind escalation of force that is pulling us headlong toward a wider war that no one wants . The answer , again , is a simple no . We are using that force and only that force that is necessary to stop this aggression . Our fighting men are in Vietnam because tens of thousands of invaders came south before them . Our numbers have increased in Vietnam because the aggression of others has increased in Vietnam . The high hopes of the aggressor have been dimmed and the tide of the battle has been turned , and our measured use of force will and must be continued . But this is prudent firmness under what I believe is careful control . There is not , and there will not be , a mindless escalation . Third , others ask if our fighting men are to be denied the help they need . The answer again is , and will be , a resounding no . Our great Military Establishment has moved 200 , 000 men across 10 , 000 miles since last spring . These men have , and will have , all they need to fight the aggressor . They have already performed miracles in combat . And the men behind them have worked miracles of supply , building new ports , transporting new equipment , opening new roads . The American forces of freedom are strong tonight in South Vietnam , and we plan to keep them so . As you know , they are led there by a brilliant and a resourceful commander , Gen . William Westmoreland . He knows the needs of war and he supports the works of peace . And when he asks for more Americans to help the men that he has , his requests will be immediately studied , and , as I promised the Nation last July , his needs will be immediately met . Fourth , some ask if our men go alone to Vietnam , if we alone respect our great commitment in the Southeast Asia Treaty . Still again the answer is a simple no . We have seven allies in SEATand we have seen five of them give us vital support , each with his own strength and in his own way , to the cause of freedom in Southeast Asia . Fifth , some ask about the risks of a wider war , perhaps against the vast land armies of Red China . And again the answer is no , never by any act of ours and not if there is any reason left behind the wild words from Peking . We have threatened no one , and we will not . We seek the end of no regime , and we will not . Our purpose is solely to defend against aggression . To any armed attack , we will reply . We have measured the strength and the weakness of others , and we think we know our own . We observe in ourselves , and we applaud in others , a careful restraint in action . We can live with anger in word as long as it is matched by caution in deed . Sixth , men ask if we rely on guns alone . Still again the answer is no . From our Honolulu meeting , from the clear pledge which joins us with our allies in Saigon , there has emerged a common dedication to the peaceful progress of the people of Vietnam to schools for their children , to care for their health , to hope and bounty for their land . The Vice President returned tonight from his constructive and very highly successful visit to Saigon and to other capitals , and he tells me that he and Ambassador Lodge have found a new conviction and purpose in South Vietnam for the battle against want and injustice as well as the battle against aggression . So the pledge of Honolulu will be kept , and the pledge of Baltimore stands open to help the men of the North when they have the wisdom to be ready . We Americans must understand how fundamental is the meaning of this second war the war on want . I talked on my ranch last fall with Secretary Freeman , Secretary of Agriculture , and in my office last week with Secretary Gardner , Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare , making over and over again the same central point The breeding ground of war is human misery . If we are not to fight forever in faraway places in Europe , or the far Pacific , or the jungles of Africa , or the suburbs of Santo Domingo then we just must learn to get at the roots of violence . As a Nation we must magnify our struggle against world hunger and illiteracy and disease . We must bring hope to men whose lives now end at two score or less . Because without that hope , without progress in this war on want , we will be called on again to fight again and again , as we are fighting tonight . Seventh , men ask who has a right to rule in South Vietnam . Our answer there is what it has been here for 200 years . The people must have this right the South Vietnamese people and no one else . Washington will not impose upon the people of South Vietnam a government not of their choice . Hanoi shall not impose upon the people of South Vietnam a government not of their choice . So we will insist for ourselves on what we require from Hanoi respect for the principle of government by the consent of the governed . We stand for self determination for free elections and we will honor their result . Eighth , men ask if we are neglecting any hopeful chance of peace . And the answer is no . A great servant of peace , Secretary Dean Rusk , has sent the message of peace on every wire and by every hand to every continent . A great pleader for peace here with us tonight , Ambassador Arthur Goldberg , has worked at home and abroad in this same cause . Their undiscouraged efforts will continue . How much wiser it would have been , how much more compassionate towards its own people , if Hanoi had only come to the bargaining table at the close of the year . Then the 7 , 000 Communist troops who have died in battle since January 1 , and the many thousands who have been wounded in that same period , would have lived at peace with their fellow men . Today , as then , Hanoi has the opportunity to end the increasing toll the war is taking on those under its command . Ninth , some ask how long we must bear this burden . To that question , in all honesty , I can give you no answer tonight . During the Battle of Britain , when that nation stood alone in 1940 , Winston Churchill gave no answer to that question . When the forces of freedom were driven from the Philippines , President Roosevelt could not and did not name the date that we would return . If the aggressor persists in Vietnam , the struggle may well be long . Our men in battle know and they accept this hard fact . We who are at home can do as much , because there is no computer that can tell the hour and the day of peace , but we do know that it will come only to the steadfast and never to the weak in heart . Tenth , and finally , men ask if it is worth it . I think you know that answer . It is the answer that Americans have given for a quarter of a century , wherever American strength has been pledged to prevent aggression . The contest in Vietnam is confused and hard , and many of its forms are new . Yet our American purpose and policy are unchanged . Our men in Vietnam are there . They are there , as Secretary Dillon told you , to keep a promise that was made 12 years ago . The Southeast Asia Treaty promised , as Secretary John Foster Dulles said for the United States that an attack upon the treaty area would occasion a reaction so united , and so strong , and so well placed that the aggressor would lose more than it could hope to gain . But we keep more than a specific treaty promise in Vietnam tonight . We keep the faith for freedom . Four Presidents have pledged to keep that faith . The first was Franklin Roosevelt , in his State of the Union Message 25 years ago . He said . . . we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers . We know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people s freedom . The second was Harry Truman , in 1947 , at a historic turning point in the history of guerrilla warfare and of Greece , Turkey , and the United States . These were his words then I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures . I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way . The third was Dwight Eisenhower , in his first Inaugural Address . He promised this Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement , we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security . Americans , indeed , all free men , remember that in the final choice a soldier s pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner s chains . And then 5 years ago , John Kennedy , on the cold bright noon of his first day in Office , proclaimed Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace , proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed , and to which we are committed today at home and around the world . Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty . This is the American tradition . Built in free discussion , proven on a hundred battlefields , rewarded by a progress at home that has no match in history , it beckons us forward tonight to the work of peace in Vietnam . We will build freedom while we fight , and we will seek peace every day by every honorable means . But we will persevere along the high hard road of freedom . We are too old to be foolhardy and we are too young to be tired . We are too strong for fear and too determined for retreat . Each evening when I retire , I take up from a bedside table reports from the battlefront and reports from the capitals around the world . They tell me how our men have fared that day in the hills and the valleys of Vietnam . They tell me what hope there seems to be that the message of peace will be heard , and that this tragic war may be ended . I read of individual acts of heroism of dedicated men and women whose valor matches that of any generation that has ever gone before . I read of men risking their lives to save others of men giving their lives to save freedom . Always among these reports are a few letters from the men out there themselves . If there is any doubt among some here at home about our purpose in Vietnam , I never find it reflected in those letters from Vietnam . Our soldiers , our Marines , our airmen , and our sailors know why they are in Vietnam . They know , as five Presidents have known , how inseparably bound together are America s freedom and the freedom of her friends around the world . So tonight let me read you from a letter that I received from an American father , a warm friend of mine of many years , about his son , a young Army captain . He said , I have never known a man at war who showed less bravado in his communications with home . When he was not flying missions in his helicopter or working out of the battalion headquarters he and some of his buddies on their own visited the orphanages as individuals and played with the kids . He was deeply interested in the Vietnamese people , particularly the peasants , and he told me how sorely they wanted , more than anything else , to just be left alone in some semblance of freedom to grow their rice and to raise their families . This good young American , as thousands like him , was not on the other side of the world fighting specifically for you or for me , President . He was fighting in perhaps our oldest American tradition , taking up for people who are king pushed around . The young captain described in this letter is dead tonight , but his spirit lives in the 200 , 000 young Americans who stand out there on freedom s frontier in Vietnam . It lives in their mothers and in their fathers here in America who have proudly watched them leave their homes for their distant struggle . So tonight I ask each citizen to join me , to join me in the homes and the meeting places our men are fighting to keep free in a prayer for their safety . I ask you to join me in a pledge to the cause for which they fight the cause of human freedom to which this great organization is dedicated . Is ask you for your help , for your understanding , and for your commitment , so that this united people may show forth to all the world that America has not ended the only struggle that is worthy of man s unceasing sacrifice the struggle to be free .<speech_sep>Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the LBJ Ranch . I hope you enjoy your stay and can bring the temperature up a little while you are here . I have today sent the following telegram to the Honorable George Wallace , Governor of Alabama , Montgomery , Alabama Responsibility for maintaining law and order in our Federal system properly rests with the State and local government . On the basis of your public statements and your discussions with me , I thought that you felt strongly about this and had indicated that you would take all the necessary action in this regard . I was surprised , therefore , when in your telegram of Thursday you requested Federal assistance in the performance of such fundamental State duties . Even more surprising was your telegram of yesterday stating that both you and the Alabama Legislature , because of monetary consideration , believe that the State is unable to protect American citizens and to maintain peace and order in a responsible manner without Federal forces . Because the court order must be obeyed and the rights of all American citizens must be protected , I intend to meet your request by providing Federal assistance to perform normal police functions . I am calling into Federal service selected units of the Alabama National Guard , and also will have available police units from the Regular Army to help you meet your State responsibilities . These forces should be adequate to assure the rights of American citizens pursuant to a Federal court order to walk peaceably and safely without injury or loss of life from Selma to Montgomery , Ala . LYNDON JOHNSON It is not a welcome duty for the Federal Government to ever assume a State Government s own responsibility for assuring the protection of citizens in the exercise of their constitutional rights . It has been rare in our history for the Governor and the legislature of a sovereign State to decline to exercise their responsibility and to request that duty be assumed by the Federal Government . Governor Wallace and the legislature of the State of Alabama have now done this . I have responded both to their request and to what I believe is the sure and the certain duty of the Federal Government in the protection of constitutional rights of all American citizens . I have called selected elements of the Alabama National Guard into Federal Service . Additionally , I have military police put in position at both Selma and Montgomery , Alabama . In addition , we have Federal marshals , FBI agents on duty in that area at this time . Last evening I dispatched Deputy Attorney General Ramsey Clark to the scene to coordinate all the National Government s activities . He is assisted by the very able Burke Marshall and John Doar and some other dozen able lawyers from the Department of Justice . Over the next several days the eyes of the Nation will be upon Alabama , and the eyes of the world will be upon America . It is my prayer , a prayer in which I hope all Americans will join me earnestly today , that the march in Alabama may proceed in a manner honoring our heritage and honoring all for which America stands . May this , the conduct of all Americans , demonstrate beyond dispute that the true strength of America lies not in arms and not in force and not in the might of the military or in the police , nor in the multitudes of marshals and State troopers but in respect and obedience to law itself . In other times a great President President Abraham Lincoln said that he was confident that we would be touched by the better angels of our nature . That is my hope for you , and my expectation of all of you and my prayer to all of you today . A nation is molded by the tests that its peoples meet and master . I believe that from the test of these days we shall emerge as a stronger nation , as a more united people , and a more just and decent society . I will now pass to another subject to Viet Nam . I want to announce this morning that Ambassador Maxwell Taylor will shortly resume his periodic visits to Washington for consultations on the Viet Nam situation . He will return to Washington on March 28 and will remain approximately a week . There are no immediate issues which make the meeting urgent . It is a regular repeat regular periodic visit , part of our continuous consultations to make sure that our effort in Viet Nam is as effective and as efficient as possible . Let me say this additionally on Viet Nam . One year ago on March 17 , 1964 , I made this statement , and I quote For 10 years , under three Presidents , this Nation has been determined to help a brave people to resist aggression and terror . It is and it will remain the policy of the United States to furnish assistance to support South Viet Nam for as long as is required to bring Communist aggression and terrorism under control . Our policy in Viet Nam is the same as it was 1 year ago , and to those of you who have inquiries on the subject , it is the same as it was 10 years ago . I have publicly stated it . I have reviewed it to the Congress in joint sessions . I have reviewed it in various messages to the Congress and I have talked individually with more than 500 of them stating the policy and asking and answering questions on that subject in the last 60 days . In addition , I have stated this policy to the press and to the public in almost every State in the Union . Specifically last night I read where I had made the policy statement 47 times . Well , I want to repeat it again this morning for your information and for emphasis . Under this policy , changes in the situation may require from time to time changes in tactics , in strategy , in equipment , in personnel . As I said last month , the continuing actions we take will be those that are justified and made necessary by the continuing aggression of others . These aggressors serve no peaceful interest , not even their own . No one threatens their regime . There is no intent or desire to conquer them or to occupy their land . What is wanted is simply that they carry out their agreements , that they end their aggression against their neighbors . The real goal of all of us in southeast Asia must be the peaceful progress of the people of that area . They have the right to live side by side in peace and independence . And if this little country does not have that fight then the question is what will happen to the other hundred little countries who want to preserve that right . They have a right to build a new sense of community among themselves . They have a right to join , with help from others , in the full development of their own resources for their own benefit . They have a right to live together without fear or oppression or domination from any quarter of this entire globe . So this is the peace for which the United States of America works today . This is the peace which aggression from the north today prevents . This is the peace which will remain the steadfast goal of the United States of America . On Monday I shall have been in the Presidential office for 16 months . Whatever the accomplishments of this period no one knows better than I how much credit is due the ability and integrity and outstanding quality of the men and women who serve the executive branch . We have between 3 and 4 million people working in the military and civilian services . I believe the quality of talent and capacity in the top positions of the Federal Government , and in the other positions as well , is without parallel in modern times . This high level of quality is going to be maintained . I am determined that the American people shall be served by the very best talent available , chosen on the basis of principles and performance , not politics or speculation . Since November 1963 I have made a total of 163 major appointments through today . Of the 135 nonjudicial appointments almost exactly half , 49 percent , have been purely merit appointments made from the career service of the Government or other Government background . Fourteen percent additionally have come from university careers , 16 percent from business and labor , 19 percent from the legal profession . And I would like to add they have included both Republicans and Democrats . This week I was privileged to announce the appointment of former Under Secretary Henry Fowler to succeed Douglas Dillon in the Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury . Today , John Macy has brought to the Ranch seven outstanding men and I am nominating them to serve in positions of major responsibility . The press will receive detailed biographical information on each . I want to announce their appointments and present these gentlemen to you this morning . For the position of Federal Cochairman of the Appalachian Commission established by the act that I signed just a week ago , I have selected John Sweeney of Michigan . This outstanding young man served as the Chairman of the Federal Development Planning Committee for Appalachia with great distinction and was a key figure in developing the program that he will now administer . Next , on the Federal Power Commission , I am reappointing a public servant from the State of Vermont who has demonstrated his commitment to the public interest , Charles Ross of Vermont . To fill the vacancy on the Federal Power Commission , I am nominating an outstanding Republican attorney from the State of Illinois , a Phi Beta Kappa , a lecturer in universities abroad , a leader in Young Republican activities who is presently serving as the general counsel of the Santa Fe Railroad Carl Bagge . On the Civil Aeronautics Board , I am making a merit appointment of a career public servant who has served as chief of the CAB s three major operating divisions , John Adams of South Dakota . On the National Labor Relations Board , I am proud to announce the nomination of a former member of the working press , a registered Republican who has served for 10 years as administrative assistant to the Republican Senior Senator from New Jersey , Clifford Case . He is Sam Zagoria of New Jersey . For the position of Under Secretary of the Army I am nominating an honor graduate of Yale University and the Yale Law School , a Silver Star Army veteran of World War Ia member of the New York Young Republicans , and now a member of a major New York law firm Stanley Resor . I am very proud of these citizens and I am grateful for their unselfishness . I wish to announce now the last appointment , Howard Woods of Louis , Missouri to be an Associate Director of the United States Information Agency . Woods is a worthy journalist . He will be one of two Associate Directors for this very important agency . He will have special responsibility for planning USIA activities in underdeveloped countries , particularly those that are trying to build their communications systems so as to increase the contact of these governments with their people . As you may know , Woods has been the reporter , the columnist , the city editor , the publisher of the Louis Argus , Louis , Missouri . Carl Rowan , the Director of USIA has told me he is increasing substantially USIA activities in countries such as Viet Nam which are caught up in new style Communist aggression . Woods will join us to help plan and direct this broadened program . So this morning the score card is 3 Republicans , 3 Democrats , and 1 Independent . Finally , because of the very considerable interest and discussions concerning the President s press policies I want to give you some idea of what you may plan and what you may expect in the days to come . First of all , I regard my own responsibility in this field as making available to all of you all of the information that I can , consistent with the national interest , on as fair and as equitable basis as possible . How and where I do that is a decision that I reserve for myself , and I shall continue to reserve for myself . Second , I consider it the responsibility of the press to report those facts to the American public as fully as possible and in the best perspective possible . The press , of course , also has the right and has the duty to comment on the facts in any way it sees fit . But that is a right and not a responsibility . Therefore , I plan to see the press at many different times in many different ways if you are willing . I will , however , try to follow the standing practice of holding at least one press conference a month of the nature which you describe as ample advance notice , coverage by all media , full dress even white ties if you choose . I do not intend to restrict myself to this as the sole form of seeing the press , but I will try to state it as a very minimum . Today marks the 39th on the record press conference that I have held , 18 off the record , or a total of 57 . I have had 18 press conferences with adequate advance notice , 16 covered by radio and television . Eight of these were live television in addition to 3 live television joint sessions in the little over a year that I have been President . There have been other occasions upon which I have seen the White House press corps on an informal basis in order to give them some insight into my thinking . In addition to these 56 formal meetings I have had 9 informal , lengthy walks with the White House press corps . Some of you who used to enjoy those walks when they were scheduled a little earlier with President Truman and from time to time those of you who enjoy them will be invited back again . On various occasions I have had conferences with pools representing the White House press . We have had 173 airplane flights with pools where they visited two pool visits while I was in the hospital with a bad cold , and one pool visit in my bedroom in the Executive Mansion when I thought I was recuperating from it . I have had additional visits from 374 accredited press representatives at their request in addition , 64 who requested meetings with bureau chiefs , plus 200 telephone discussions that I have responded to . There have been 9 other occasions where I have met with the press ranging from a barbecue at the Ranch to addresses made to the American Society of Newspaper Editors , the Associated Press luncheon , and of course last year each one of the social affairs , White House press conference and gridiron etc . , I believe numbered 8 . I have had 9 special appearances ranging from a television interview with all 3 networks to special statements concerning Viet Nam and the railroad strike . A considerable amount of my time has been spent with the press in this effort to discharge what I consider to be the President s responsibility to this country . I think that it is necessary to do this because the press is the media through which the American people are informed and as I said , I intend to continue to bring them all the information that is possible and to see that every Cabinet officer and every head of an independent agency does the same thing . Insofar as the President is concerned , I will continue seeing the press at different times , different places , and different ways at my own choosing . I am ready for any questions . We anticipate the march will have been concluded by that period and we cannot tell at this time any reason why it should go beyond that . If it is necessary , we will take appropriate action at an appropriate time . Well , for the moment we have called up 1 , 863 National Guardsmen . In addition , we have approximately 100 FBI men . We have approximately 75 to 100 marshals that are present others will join them later in the day . In addition , we have 500 men in place from Ft . Bragg that are now at Maxwell Field , Montgomery . In addition to that , we have 509 men at the moment in place at Craig Field , Selma . On alert , we have a reinforced battalion at Ft . Benning , that can be there on short notice , of an additional thousand men . One company can be ready to move and be there in a very few hours . The others are alerted . These military forces are being placed under the command of Brig . Gen . Henry Graham , who , some of you will remember , is the assistant division commander of the 31st Infantry Division . He was the Guardsman commander of the forces that were federalized at Tuscaloosa . He is assisted by a Regular Army man , Brig . Gen . James Wright . I do not want to leave such an impression . I want to correct it if I have left the wrong impression . What motivates Governor Wallace is a matter that he can discuss with you better than I can . He has his responsibilities and he is going to exercise them according to his judgment and his views , and I plan to do the same thing . I just repeated the statement he made in his wire . We are keeping in very close touch with the leaders of the march . We have reasonably accurate estimates of how many we think will be included . We have medical forces in the general area . They have been alerted to take care of any needs that may arise , and we hope and pray that there will be none . We have a 75 bed hospital with 5 doctors and 5 ambulances , 43 aircraft , helicopters 5 ambulatory patient , 2 litters with corpsmen . This is located at Craig in Selma . At Maxwell Field we have a 250 bed hospital , 50 doctors , 5 ambulances , 4 H 43 aircraft . We trust it will not be necessary to use any of these , but we have taken the precaution , and there is hardly a day passes but what the President is asked to provide medical service to some citizen where it is not available from other sources , and we do that in all instances where it is justified . We have been constantly in touch with him , General Katzenbach , and other members of the executive branch in Washington and here . Since I received his wire the other evening I have not talked to him , have not talked to any of his people , but our people are talking to him with regularity and trying to give such counsel and guidance as we think will be helpful . We do not discuss iffy questions like that . We will give consideration to the problems and the needs of the various nations and countries , and while we have them under consideration we will try to evaluate them and if a decision is reached in any area with any country , why we will carry it out . But we do not think that it is desirable to speculate or to engage in any prophecies that may or may not work out . The administration has made its proposals in the form of legislation pending before the House committee . There will be a number of amendments added to that and a number of changes , and my own personal view is included in the recommendations in that bill which is available to you . I should have liked to have gone further if I thought I could have without a constitutional amendment , if I could have done it by statute in other respects concerning voting , but the legal talents available did not think that we could make these additions . The final judgment of just how far we do go in connection with literacy and qualifications of the electors will be determined by the two judiciary committees made up of lawyers and the other Members of the Congress . Very frankly , I would like to have included in the message a provision that would permit all people over 18 years of age to vote , but the lawyers felt that would complicate the matter and that it should be approached otherwise . But specifically answering your question , what final action will be taken in the bill that is sent to me will be determined by what is going on now , and I hope that they will work every morning and afternoon and night and that we can have legislation very shortly . I would not want to tell you or them or the country any of our evaluation of military operations at this time . We are being as effective and as efficient as we know how . We have our policy of responding appropriately , fittingly , and measured . We are doing everything that we know to try to bring about freedom for South Viet Nam and peace in that area . That was the policy that General Eisenhower announced when he was President when we assumed responsibilities there . That was the policy provided for in the SEATO Treaty that passed the Senate 82 to 1 , which obligates us to the commitment we have made there . That was the policy that was incorporated in the resolution passed August the 10th by the Congress . But to give a day to day evaluation of what effect this strike or that strike might have would not only contribute , I think , to confusion and perhaps might be inaccurate , but would be ill advised , I think . Well , we sent them a wire congratulating them and expressing our good wishes for the successful outcome of one of their tests . Administrator Webb is here today . He came in last night from New Mexico where he has been on an official visit . I asked him to be here this morning . He and I have reviewed the Russian activity in space this week , as well as our own planned activity next week . The Soviet accomplishment and our own scheduled efforts demonstrate , I think , dramatically and convincingly the important role that man himself will play in the exploration of the space frontier . The continuing efforts of both our program and the Russian program will steadily produce new capabilities and new space activities . These capabilities , in my judgment , will help each nation achieve broader confidence to do what they consider they ought to do in space . I have felt since the days when I introduced the space act and sat studying Sputnik I and Sputnik II that it was really a mistake to regard space exploration as a contest which can be tallied on any box score . Judgments can be made only by considering all the objectives of the two national programs , and they will vary and they will differ . Our own program is very broadly based . We believe very confidently in the United States that we will produce contributions that we need at the time we need them . For that reason I gave Webb and his group every dollar in the budget this year that they asked for , for a manned space flight . Now the progress of our program is very satisfactory to me in every respect . We are committed to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind . We stressed that in our hearings and our legislation when we passed the bill . And while the Soviet is ahead of us in some aspects of space , leadership is clear and decisive and we are ahead of them in other realms on which we have particularly concentrated . If it is not an imposition on you and if you care to I have not consulted him but after the conference is over , if you are not in too big a hurry to get back to the Driskill , Webb will be here and he will answer any questions you may want to ask him . I think you have stated the facts that are available to all of us . The people on the ground are taking judicious notice of the entire situation . We hope that we have taken the necessary precautions and we are adequately prepared to deal with whatever may develop . But I think it would be a great mistake to predict disaster , and I think that we have the people that have the training and that will carry out the normal police functions , and I hope we have the patriotism on every side of the question and on all viewpoints to obey law and order and to respond to my plea this morning that we conduct ourselves as law abiding Americans who want to unite our country instead of divide it . I think our position is all right at the present time . I never know what any statement what effect it may have on some other person . We have freedom of speech in this country , and that is one of the things that we are working toward in our calling up the Guard last night , and we have freedom of assembly , and I have observed no lack of it in Congress in the time I have been there in 35 years I have seen no restraints imposed by anybody . I have never discussed with a human being something he should say or should not say on Viet Nam . I think debate is healthy , it is good for us , provided it is responsible . And I think we have had debate . I have met with 520 , I believe , Congressmen and Senators for over 2 hours for over 11 nights , and each one of them could ask any question he wanted to . The Secretary of State gave them a thorough briefing the Secretary of Defense , the President , and the Vice President . And as I stated , you have raised the question with me 47 times . We have covered it very good . So maybe the Senators and Congressmen have some speeches left in order to be even with us . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>My fellow Americans Not long ago I received a letter from a woman in the Midwest . She wrote Dear President In my humble way I am writing to you about the crisis in Viet Nam . I have a son who is now in Viet Nam . My husband served in World War IOur country was at war , but now , this time , it is just something that I do not understand . Why Well , I have tried to answer that question dozens of times and more in practically every State in this Union . I have discussed it fully in Baltimore in April , in Washington in May , in San Francisco in June . Let me again , now , discuss it here in the East Room of the White House . Why must young Americans , born into a land exultant with hope and with golden promise , toil and suffer and sometimes die in such a remote and distant place The answer , like the war itself , is not an easy one , but it echoes clearly from the painful lessons of half a century . Three times in my lifetime , in two World Wars and in Korea , Americans have gone to far lands to fight for freedom . We have learned at a terrible and a brutal cost that retreat does not bring safety and weakness does not bring peaceIt is this lesson that has brought us to Viet Nam . This is a different kind of war . There are no marching armies or solemn declarations . Some citizens of South Viet Nam at times , with understandable grievances , have joined in the attack on their own government . But we must not let this mask the central fact that this is really war . It is guided by North Viet Nam and it is spurred by Communist China . Its goal is to conquer the South , to defeat American power , and to extend the Asiatic dominion of communism . There are great stakes in the balance . Most of the non Communist nations of Asia cannot , by themselves and alone , resist the growing might and the grasping ambition of Asian communism . Our power , therefore , is a very vital shield . If we are driven from the field in Viet Nam , then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in American promise , or in American protection . In each land the forces of independence would be considerably weakened , and an Asia so threatened by Communist domination would certainly imperil the security of the United States itself . We did not choose to be the guardians at the gate , but there is no one else . Nor would surrender in Viet Nam bring peace , because we learned from Hitler at Munich that success only feeds the appetite of aggression . The battle would be renewed in one country and then another country , bringing with it perhaps even larger and crueler conflict , as we have learned from the lessons of history . Moreover , we are in Viet Nam to fulfill one of the most solemn pledges of the American Nation . Three Presidents President Eisenhower , President Kennedy , and your present President over 11 years have committed themselves and have promised to help defend this small and valiant nation . Strengthened by that promise , the people of South Viet Nam have fought for many long years . Thousands of them have died . Thousands more have been crippled and scarred by war . We just cannot now dishonor our word , or abandon our commitment , or leave those who believed us and who trusted us to the terror and repression and murder that would follow . This , then , my fellow Americans , is why we are in Viet Nam . My fellow Americans Once again in man s age old struggle for a better life and a world of peace , the wisdom , courage , and compassion of the American people are being put to the test . This is the meaning of the tragic conflict in Vietnam . In meeting the present challenge , it is essential that our people seek understanding , and that our leaders speak with candor . I have therefore directed that this report to the American people be compiled and widely distributed . In its pages you will find statements on Vietnam by three leaders of your Government by your President , your Secretary of State , and your Secretary of Defense . These statements were prepared for different audiences , and they reflect the differing responsibilities of each speaker . The congressional testimony has been edited to avoid undue repetition and to incorporate the sense of the discussions that ensued . Together , they construct a clear definition of America s role in the Vietnam conflict the dangers and hopes that Vietnam holds for all free men the fullness and limits of our national objectives in a war we did not seek the constant effort on our part to bring this war we do not desire to a quick and honorable end . What are our goals in that war strained land First , we intend to convince the Communists that we cannot be defeated by force of arms or by superior power . They are not easily convinced . In recent months they have greatly increased their fighting forces and their attacks and the number of incidents . I have asked the Commanding General , General Westmoreland , what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression . He has told me . We will meet his needs . I have today ordered to Viet Nam the Air Mobile Division and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength from 75 , 000 to 125 , 000 men almost immediately . Additional forces will be needed later , and they will be sent as requested . This will make it necessary to increase our active fighting forces by raising the monthly draft call from 17 , 000 over a period of time to 35 , 000 per month , and for us to step up our campaign for voluntary enlistments . After this past week of deliberations , I have concluded that it is not essential to order Reserve units into service now . If that necessity should later be indicated , I will give the matter most careful consideration and I will give the country you an adequate notice before taking such action , but only after full preparations . We have also discussed with the Government of South Viet Nam lately , the steps that we will take to substantially increase their own effort , both on the battlefield and toward reform and progress in the villages . Ambassador Lodge is now formulating a new program to be tested upon his return to that area . I have directed Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara to be available immediately to the Congress to review with these committees , the appropriate congressional committees , what we plan to do in these areas . I have asked them to be able to answer the questions of any Member of Congress . Secretary McNamara , in addition , will ask the Senate Appropriations Committee to add a limited amount to present legislation to help meet part of this new cost until a supplemental measure is ready and hearings can be held when the Congress assembles in January . In the meantime , we will use the authority contained in the present Defense appropriation bill under consideration to transfer funds in addition to the additional money that we will ask . These steps , like our actions in the past , are carefully measured to do what must be done to bring an end to aggression and a peaceful settlement . We do not want an expanding struggle with consequences that no one can perceive , nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt our power , but we will not surrender and we will not retreat . For behind our American pledge lies the determination and resources , I believe , of all of the American Nation . Second , once the Communists know , as we know , that a violent solution is impossible , then a peaceful solution is inevitable . We are ready now , as we have always been , to move from the battlefield to the conference table . I have stated publicly and many times , again and again , America s willingness to begin unconditional discussions with any government , at any place , at any time . Fifteen efforts have been made to start these discussions with the help of 40 nations throughout the world , but there has been no answer . But we are going to continue to persist , if persist we must , until death and desolation have led to the same conference table where others could now join us at a much smaller cost . I have spoken many times of our objectives in Viet Nam . So has the Government of South Viet Nam . Hanoi has set forth its own proposals . We are ready to discuss their proposals and our proposals and any proposals of any government whose people may be affected , for we fear the meeting room no more than we fear the battlefield . In this pursuit we welcome and we ask for the concern and the assistance of any nation and all nations . If the United Nations and its officials or any one of its 114 members can by deed or word , private initiative or public action , bring us nearer an honorable peace , then they will have the support and the gratitude of the United States of America . I have directed Ambassador Goldberg to go to New York today and to present immediately to Secretary General U Thant a letter from me requesting that all the resources , energy , and immense prestige of the United Nations be employed to find ways to halt aggression and to bring peace in Viet Nam . I made a similar request at San Francisco a few weeks ago , because we do not seek the destruction of any government , nor do we covet a foot of any territory . But we insist and we will always insist that the people of South Viet Nam shall have the right of choice , the right to shape their own destiny in free elections in the South or throughout all Viet Nam under international supervision , and they shall not have any government imposed upon them by force and terror so long as we can prevent it . This was the purpose of the 1954 agreements which the Communists have now cruelly shattered . If the machinery of those agreements was tragically weak , its purposes still guide our action . As battle rages , we will continue as best we can to help the good people of South Viet Nam enrich the condition of their life , to feed the hungry and to tend the sick , and teach the young , and shelter the homeless , and to help the farmer to increase his crops , and the worker to find a job . It is an ancient but still terrible irony that while many leaders of men create division in pursuit of grand ambitions , the children of man are really united in the simple , elusive desire for a life of fruitful and rewarding toil . As I said at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore , I hope that one day we can help all the people of Asia toward that desire . Eugene Black has made great progress since my appearance in Baltimore in that direction not as the price of peace , for we are ready always to bear a more painful cost , but rather as a part of our obligations of justice toward our fellow man . Let me also add now a personal note . I do not find it easy to send the flower of our youth , our finest young men , into battle . I have spoken to you today of the divisions and the forces and the battalions and the units , but I know them all , every one . I have seen them in a thousand streets , of a hundred towns , in every State in this Union working and laughing and building , and filled with hope and life . I think I know , too , how their mothers weep and how their families sorrow . This is the most agonizing and the most painful duty of your President . There is something else , too . When I was young , poverty was so common that we did not know it had a name . An education was something that you had to fight for , and water was really life itself . I have now been in public life 35 years , more than three decades , and in each of those 35 years I have seen good men , and wise leaders , struggle to bring the blessings of this land to all of our people . And now I am the President . It is now my opportunity to help every child get an education , to help every Negro and every American citizen have an equal opportunity , to have every family get a decent home , and to help bring healing to the sick and dignity to the old . As I have said before , that is what I have lived for , that is what I have wanted all my life since I was a little boy , and I do not want to see all those hopes and all those dreams of so many people for so many years now drowned in the wasteful ravages of cruel wars . I am going to do all I can do to see that that never happens . But I also know , as a realistic public servant , that as long as there are men who hate and destroy , we must have the courage to resist , or we will see it all , all that we have built , all that we hope to build , all of our dreams for freedom all , all will be swept away on the flood of conquest . So , too , this shall not happen . We will stand in Viet Nam . Now , what America is , and was , and hopes to stand for as an important national asset , telling the truth to this world , telling an exciting story , is the Voice of America . I classify this assignment in the front rank of importance to the freedom of the world , and that is why today I am proud to announce to you the name of the man who will direct the Voice of America . He is a man whose voice and whose face and whose mind is known to this country and to most of the entire world . His name is John Chancellor . Chancellor was born 38 years ago in Chicago . For more than 15 years he has been with the news department of the National Broadcasting Company . During that time he has covered the world in Vienna , London , Moscow , New York , Brussels , Berlin , and Washington . Since 1964 he has been with you , one of the White House correspondents . This , I think , is the first time in the history of the Voice of America that a working newspaperman , a respected commentator , an experienced , independent reporter , has been given the responsibility of leadership and direction in this vital enterprise . I think he understands the challenges that are present and the achievements that are possible . I am satisfied that the Voice of America will be in imaginative , competent , reliable , and always truthful hands . Stand up , John , will you please The President has few responsibilities of greater importance or greater consequence to the country s future than the constitutional responsibility of nominating Justices for the Supreme Court of the United States . I am happy today , here in the East Room , to announce that the distinguished American who was my first choice for the position now vacant on the Supreme Court , has agreed to accept this call to this vital duty . I will very shortly , this afternoon , send to the United States Senate my nomination of the Honorable Abe Fortas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court . For many , many years , I have regarded Fortas as one of this Nation s most able and most respected and most outstanding citizens , a scholar , a profound thinker , a lawyer of superior ability , and a man of humane and deeply compassionate feelings toward his fellow man a champion of our liberties . That opinion is shared by the legal profession and by the bar of this country , by Members of the Congress and by the leaders of business and labor , and other sectors of our national life . Fortas has , as you know , told me on numerous occasions in the last 20 months , that he would not be an applicant or a candidate , or would not accept any appointment to any public office . This is , I guess , as it should be , for in this instance the job has sought the man . Fortas agrees that the duty and the opportunity of service on the highest court of this great country , is not a call that any citizen can reject . So I am proud for the country that he has , this morning , accepted this appointment and will serve his country as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court . I will be glad to take your questions now for a period . I do not want to speculate on the reactions of other people . This Nation is prepared , and will always be prepared , to protect its national interest . Yes , I think the American people ought to understand that there is no quick solution to the problem that we face there . I would not want to prophesy or predict whether it would be a matter of months or years or decades . I do not know that we had any accurate timetable on how long it would take to bring victory in World War I do not think anyone really knew whether it would be 2 years or 4 years or 6 years , to meet with success in World War II do think our cause is just . I do think our purposes and objectives are beyond any question . I do believe that America will stand united behind her men that are there . I plan , as long as I am President , to see that our forces are strong enough to protect our national interest , our right hand constantly protecting that interest with our military , and that our diplomatic and political negotiations are constantly attempting to find some solution that would substitute words for bombs . As I have said so many times , if anyone questions our good faith and will ask us to meet them to try to reason this matter out , they will find us at the appointed place , at the appointed time , in the proper chair . We are always hopeful that every effort in that direction will meet with success . We welcome those efforts as we welcomed the Commonwealth proposal , as we welcomed Davies visit , as we welcomed the Indian suggestion , as we have welcomed the efforts of the distinguished Prime Minister of Great Britain and others from time to time . As I just said , I hope that every member of the United Nations that has any idea , any plan , any program , any suggestion , that they will not let them go unexplored . I have not the slightest doubt but whatever it is necessary to face , the American people will face . I think that all of us know that we are now in the 5 ad month of the prosperity that has been unequaled in this Nation , and I see no reason for declaring a national emergency and I rejected that course of action earlier today when I made my decision . I cannot foresee what next year , or the following year , or the following year will hold . I only know that the Americans will do whatever is necessary . At the moment we enjoy the good fortune of having an unparalleled period of prosperity with us , and this Government is going to do all it can to see it continue . No , we have no information as to how they were manned . We cannot speak with any authority on that matter . We made the decision that we felt our national interests required , and as those problems present themselves we will face up to them . We have communicated with most of the friendly nations of the world in the last few days and we have received from them responses that have been encouraging . I would not want to go into any individual response here , but I would say that I have indicated to all of the friendly nations what our problems were there , the decision that confronted us , and asked for their help and for their suggestions . We would hope very much that it could and we will do nothing to provoke that confrontation if we can avoid it . As you know , immediately after I assumed the Presidency I immediately sent messages to the Soviet Union . We have had frequent exchange of views by letter and by conversation with Gromyko and Dobrynin . We are doing nothing to provoke the Soviet Union . We are very happy that they agreed to resume the disarmament conference . I went to some length to try to extend ourselves to make the proposals that I would hope would meet with acceptance of the peoples of the world . We would like to believe that there could be some success flow from this conference although we have not been too successful . I know of nothing that we have in mind that should arouse the distrust or provoke any violence on the part of the Soviet Union . It does not imply any change in policy whatever . It does not imply any change of objective . I have made very clear in my San Francisco speech my hope that the Secretary General , under his wise leadership , would explore every possibility that might lead to a solution of this matter . In my letter to the Secretary General this morning , which Ambassador Goldberg will deliver later in the day , I reiterate my hopes and my desires and I urge upon him that he if he agrees that he undertake new efforts in this direction . Ambassador Goldberg understands the challenge . We spent the weekend talking about the potentialities and the possibilities , our hopes and our dreams , and I believe that we will have an able advocate and a searching negotiator who , I would hope , would some day find success . I do not know . That would depend on the circumstances . I cannot pinpoint the date on the calendar , or the hour of the day . I have to ask Congress for their judgments and for their decisions almost every hour of the day . One of the principal duties of the Office of President is to maintain constant consultation . I have talked to , I guess , more than 50 Members of Congress in the last 24 hours . I have submitted myself to their questions , and the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense will meet with them tomorrow if they are ready , to answer any questions that they may need . Up to now , we have had ample authority , excellent cooperation , a united Congress behind us , and as near as I could tell from my meetings last night with the leaders , and from my meetings today with the distinguished chairmen of the committees and the members of both parties we all met as Americans , united and determined to stand as one . Yes . I do not interpret it that way . I think that there are dangers in escalation . I do not think I have any right to commit the whole world to world war III am doing everything I know how to avoid it . But retreat is not necessarily the best way to avoid it . I have outlined to you what I think is the best policy . I would hope that Governor Hatfield and the other Governors , when they understand what we are doing , and when I have a chance to submit myself to their questioning and to counsel with them , would share my view . I know they have the same concern for the American people and the people of the world as I do . I do not believe our objectives will be very different . As a matter of fact , I asked the Governors if they could , to come here at the conclusion of their deliberations . I will have my plane go to Minneapolis tomorrow , and I believe 43 of the 48 have indicated a desire to come here . I will give them all the information I can confidential , secret , and otherwise because I have great respect for them , their judgments , their opinions , and their leadership . It is going to be necessary in this effort . I will also have the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense review with them all their plans , and answer any of their inquiries , and we hope resolve any doubts they might have . Well , I do not agree with that . I do not guess there is anyone in this country that has as much understanding and as much help , and as many experts , and as good advice , and many people of both parties trying to help them , as they are me . Of course I admit I need it more than anybody else . Nancy , I have not been lonely the last few days I have had lots of callers . We have stated time and time again that we would negotiate with any government , any place , any time . The Viet Cong would have no difficulty in being represented and having their views presented if Hanoi for a moment decides she wants to cease aggression . And I would not think that would be an insurmountable problem at all . I think that could be worked out . No , not at all . My appointment of Gardner suggests that I looked over America to find the very best man I could to lead us forward to become an educated nation where every child obtains all the education that he can take , and where the health of every citizen is his prime concern , and where the Social Security system is brought to the needs of the 20th century . After canvassing some 40 or 50 possibilities , I concluded that Gardner was the best man I could get . I asked his board to relieve him of his duties and release him to the Government so that he could furnish the dynamic leadership officially that he has been furnishing unofficially to us . He told me yesterday morning that he was prepared to do that . I remembered that I had not asked him what State he lived in , where his permanent residence was , so I could put it on the nomination paper , or what party he belonged to . And he rather well , maybe somewhat hesitantly said , I am a Republican . I do not mean that his hesitating meant any particular significance , but I was happy that he said that because a good many Republicans voted for me and I do not want to be partial or partisan in this administration . I like to see leadership of that kind come from the Republican ranks . So I told him if he had no objections , I would announce very promptly his appointment and I hoped that he would give us American leadership without regard to party . And that is what I think he will do . I believe all the Nation will be proud of him as we are of Secretary Celebrezze . Thank you , President .<speech_sep>Newhouse , Chancellor Tolley , Governor and Rockefeller , Members of the Congress , distinguished guests , members of the faculty , ladies and gentlemen I know that you share with me the great admiration and pride that the generosity of Newhouse has made possible for this area of our Nation and for this great institution . We all are in his debt , and in the years and generations and centuries to come , we will see the products of this great adventure . On this occasion , it is fitting , I think , that we are meeting here to dedicate this new center to better understanding among all men . For that is my purpose in speaking to you . Last night I spoke to the people of the Nation . This morning , I speak to the people of all nations so that they may understand without mistake our purpose in the action that we have been required to take . On August 2 the United States destroyer Maddox was attacked on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin by hostile vessels of the Government of North Viet Nam . On August 4 that attack was repeated in those same waters against two United States destroyers . The attacks were deliberate . The attacks were unprovoked . The attacks have been answered . Throughout last night and within the last 12 hours , air units of the United States Seventh Fleet have sought out the hostile vessels and certain of their supporting facilities . . Appropriate armed action has been taken against them . The United States is now asking that this be brought immediately and urgently before the Security Council of the United Nations . We welcome and we invite the scrutiny of all men who seek peace , for peace is the only purpose of the course that America pursues . The Gulf of Tonkin may be distant , but none can be detached about what has happened there . Aggression deliberate , willful , and systematic aggression has unmasked its face to the entire world . The world remembers the world must never forget that aggression unchallenged is aggression unleashed . We of the United States have not forgotten . That is why we have answered this aggression with action . America s course is not precipitate . America s course is not without long provocation . For 10 years three American Presidents President Eisenhower , President Kennedy , and your present President and the American people have been actively concerned with threats to the peace and security of the peoples of southeast Asia from the Communist government of North Viet Nam . President Eisenhower sought and President Kennedy sought the same objectives that I still seek That the governments of southeast Asia honor the international agreements which apply in the area That those governments leave each other alone That they resolve their differences peacefully That they devote their talents to bettering the lives of their peoples by working against poverty and disease and ignorance . In 1954 we made our position clear toward Viet Nam . In June of that year we stated we would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the 1954 agreements with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security . In September of that year the United States signed the Manila pact on which our participation in SEATO is based . That pact recognized that aggression by means of armed attack on South Viet Nam would endanger the peace and the safety of the nations signing that solemn agreement . In 1962 we made our position clear toward Laos . We signed the Declaration of Neutrality of Laos . That accord provided for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and respect for the neutrality and independence of that little country . The agreements of 1954 and 1962 were also signed by the government of North Viet Nam . In 1954 that government pledged that it would respect the territory under the military control of the other party and engage in no hostile act against the other party . In 1962 that government pledged that it would not introduce into the Kingdom of Laos foreign troops or military personnel . That government also pledged that it would not use the territory of the Kingdom of Laos for interference in the internal affairs of other countries . That government of North Viet Nam is now willfully and systematically violating those agreements of both 1954 and 1962 . To the south it is engaged in aggression against the Republic of Viet Nam . To the west it is engaged in aggression against the Kingdom of Laos . To the east it has now struck out on the high seas in an act of aggression against the United States of America . There can be , there must be no doubt about the policy and no doubt about the purpose . So there can be no doubt about the responsibilities of men and the responsibilities of nations that are devoted to peace . Peace cannot be assured merely by assuring the safety of the United States destroyer Maddox or the safety of other vessels of other flags . Peace requires that the existing agreements in the area be honored . Peace requires that we and all our friends stand firm against the present aggressions of the government of North Viet Nam . The government of North Viet Nam is today flouting the will of the world for peace . The world is challenged to make its will against war known and to make it known clearly and to make it felt and to make it felt decisively . So , to our friends of the Atlantic Alliance , let me say this , this morning the challenge that we face in southeast Asia today is the same challenge that we have faced with courage and that we have met with strength in Greece and Turkey , in Berlin and Korea , in Lebanon and in Cuba . And to any who may be tempted to support or to widen the present aggression I say this there is no threat to any peaceful power from the United States of America . But there can be no peace by aggression and no immunity from reply . That is what is meant by the actions that we took yesterday . Finally , my fellow Americans , I would like to say to ally and adversary alike let no friend needlessly fear and no foe vainly hope that this is a nation divided in this election year . Our free elections our full and free debate are America s strength , not America s weakness . There are no parties and there is no partisanship when our peace or the peace of the world is imperiled by aggressors in any part of the world . We are one nation united and indivisible . And united and indivisible we shall remain .<speech_sep>
