To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States In order to prosecute the war against Mexico with vigor and success , it is necessary that authority should be promptly given by Congress to increase the Regular Army and to remedy existing defects in its organization . With this view your favorable attention is invited to the annual report of the Secretary of War , which accompanied my message of the 8th instant , in which he recommends that ten additional regiments of regular troops shall be raised , to serve during the war . Of the additional regiments of volunteers which have been called for from several of the States , some have been promptly raised but this has not been the case in regard to all . The existing law , requiring that they should be organized by the independent action of the State governments , has in some instances occasioned considerable delay , and it is yet uncertain when the troops required can be ready for service in the field . It is our settled policy to maintain in time of peace as small a Regular Army as the exigencies of the public service will permit . In a state of war , notwithstanding the great advantage with which our volunteer citizen soldiers can be brought into the field , this small Regular Army must be increased in its numbers in order to render the whole force more efficient . Additional officers as well as men then become indispensable . Under the circumstances of our service a peculiar propriety exists for increasing the officers , especially in the higher grades . The number of such officers who from age and other causes are rendered incapable of active service in the field has seriously impaired the efficiency of the Army . From the report of the Secretary of War it appears that about two thirds of the whole number of regimental field officers are either permanently disabled or are necessarily detached from their commands on other duties . The long enjoyment of peace has prevented us from experiencing much embarrassment from this cause , but now , in a state of war , conducted in a foreign country , it has produced serious injury to the public service . An efficient organization of the Army , composed of regulars and volunteers , whilst prosecuting the war in Mexico , it is believed would require the appointment of a general officer to take the command of all our military forces in the field . Upon the conclusion of the war the services of such an officer would no longer be necessary , and should be dispensed with upon the reduction of the Army to a peace establishment . I recommend that provision be made by law for the appointment of such a general officer to serve during the war . It is respectfully recommended that early action should be had by Congress upon the suggestions submitted for their consideration , as necessary to insure active and efficient service in prosecuting the war , before the present favorable season for military operations in the enemy s country shall have passed away .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives The annual meeting of Congress is always an interesting event . The representatives of the States and of the people come fresh from their constituents to take counsel together for the common good . After an existence of near three fourths of a century as a free and independent Republic , the problem no longer remains to be solved whether man is capable of self government . The success of our admirable system is a conclusive refutation of the theories of those in other countries who maintain that a favored few are born to rule and that the mass of mankind must be governed by force . Subject to no arbitrary or hereditary authority , the people are the only sovereigns recognized by our Constitution . Numerous emigrants , of every lineage and language , attracted by the civil and religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition , annually crowd to our shores , and transfer their heart , not less than their allegiance , to the country whose dominion belongs alone to the people . No country has been so much favored , or should acknowledge with deeper reverence the manifestations of the divine protection . An all wise Creator directed and guarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and has constantly watched over our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nations of the earth . It is in a country thus favored , and under a Government in which the executive and legislative branches hold their authority for limited periods alike from the people , and where all are responsible to their respective constituencies , that it is again my duty to communicate with Congress upon the state of the Union and the present condition of public affairs . During the past year the most gratifying proofs are presented that our country has been blessed with a widespread and universal prosperity . There has been no period since the Government was founded when all the industrial pursuits of our people have been more successful or when labor in all branches of business has received a fairer or better reward . From our abundance we have been enabled to perform the pleasing duty of furnishing food for the starving millions of less favored countries . In the enjoyment of the bounties of Providence at home such as have rarely fallen to the lot of any people , it is cause of congratulation that our intercourse with all the powers of the earth except Mexico continues to be of an amicable character . It has ever been our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will with all nations , and this policy has been steadily pursued by me . No change has taken place in our relations with Mexico since the adjournment of the last Congress . The war in which the United States were forced to engage with the Government of that country still continues . I deem it unnecessary , after the full exposition of them contained in my message of the 11th of May , 1846 , and in my annual message at the commencement of the session of Congress in December last , to reiterate the serious causes of complaint which we had against Mexico before she commenced hostilities . It is sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton violation of the rights of person and property of our citizens committed by Mexico , her repeated acts of bad faith through a long series of years , and her disregard of solemn treaties stipulating for indemnity to our injured citizens not only constituted ample cause of war on our part , but were of such an aggravated character as would have justified us before the whole world in resorting to this extreme remedy . With an anxious desire to avoid a rupture between the two countries , we forbore for years to assert our clear rights by force , and continued to seek redress for the wrongs we had suffered by amicable negotiation in the hope that Mexico might yield to pacific counsels and the demands of justice . In this hope we were disappointed . Our minister of peace sent to Mexico was insultingly rejected . The Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he was authorized to propose , and finally , under wholly unjustifiable pretexts , involved the two countries in war by invading the territory of the State of Texas , striking the first blow , and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil . Though the United States were the aggrieved nation , Mexico commenced the war , and we were compelled in self defense to repel the invader and to vindicate the national honor and interests by prosecuting it with vigor until we could obtain a just and honorable peace . On learning that hostilities had been commenced by Mexico I promptly communicated that fact , accompanied with a succinct statement of our other causes of complaint against Mexico , to Congress , and that body , by the act of the 13th of May , 1846 , declared that by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government and the United States . This act declaring the war to exist by the act of the Republic of Mexico , and making provision for its prosecution to a speedy and successful termination , was passed with great unanimity by Congress , there being but two negative votes in the Senate and but fourteen in the House of Representatives . The existence of the war having thus been declared by Congress , it became my duty under the Constitution and the laws to conduct and prosecute it . This duty has been performed , and though at every stage of its progress I have manifested a willingness to terminate it by a just peace , Mexico has refused to accede to any terms which could be accepted by the United States consistently with the national honor and interest . The rapid and brilliant successes of our arms and the vast extent of the enemy s territory which had been overrun and conquered before the close of the last session of Congress were fully known to that body . Since that time the war has been prosecuted with increased energy , and , I am gratified to state , with a success which commands universal admiration . . History presents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by any nation within so short a period . Our Army , regulars and volunteers , have covered themselves with imperishable honors . Whenever and wherever our forces have encountered the enemy , though he was in vastly superior numbers and often intrenched in fortified positions of his own selection and of great strength , he has been defeated . Too much praise can not be bestowed upon our officers and men , regulars and volunteers , for their gallantry , discipline , indomitable courage , and perseverance , all seeking the post of danger and vying with each other in deeds of noble daring . While every patriot s heart must exult and a just national pride animate every bosom in beholding the high proofs of courage , consummate military skill , steady discipline , and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibited by our gallant Army , the nation is called to mourn over the loss of many brave officers and soldiers , who have fallen in defense of their country s honor and interests . The brave dead met their melancholy fate in a foreign land , nobly discharging their duty , and with their country s flag waving triumphantly in the face of the foe . Their patriotic deeds are justly appreciated , and will long be remembered by their grateful countrymen . The parental care of the Government they loved and served should be extended to their surviving families . Shortly after the adjournment of the last session of Congress the gratifying intelligence was received of the signal victory of Buena Vista , and of the fall of the city of Vera Cruz , and with it the strong castle of San Juan de Ulloa , by which it was defended . Believing that after these and other successes so honorable to our arms and so disastrous to Mexico the period was propitious to afford her another opportunity , if she thought proper to embrace it , to enter into negotiations for peace , a commissioner was appointed to proceed to the headquarters of our Army with full powers to enter upon negotiations and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of peace . He was not directed to make any new overtures of peace , but was the bearer of a dispatch from the Secretary of State of the United States to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico , in reply to one received from the latter of the 22d of February , 1847 , in which the Mexican Government was informed of his appointment and of his presence at the headquarters of our Army , and that he was invested with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty of peace whenever the Mexican Government might signify a desire to do so . While I was unwilling to subject the United States to another indignant refusal , I was yet resolved that the evils of the war should not be protracted a day longer than might be rendered absolutely necessary by the Mexican Government . Care was taken to give no instructions to the commissioner which could in any way interfere with our military operations or relax our energies in the prosecution of the war . He possessed no authority in any manner to control these operations . He was authorized to exhibit his instructions to the general in command of the Army , and in the event of a treaty being concluded and ratified on the part of Mexico he was directed to give him notice of that fact . On the happening of such contingency , and on receiving notice thereof , the general in command was instructed by the Secretary of War to suspend further active military operations until further orders . These instructions were given with a view to intermit hostilities until the treaty thus ratified by Mexico could be transmitted to Washington and receive the action of the Government of the United States . The commissioner was also directed on reaching the Army to deliver to the general in command the dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico , and on receiving it the general was instructed by the Secretary of War to cause it to be transmitted to the commander of the Mexican forces , with a quest that it might be communicated to his Government . The commissioner did not reach the headquarters of the Army until after another brilliant victory had crowned our arms at Cerro Gordo . The dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of War to the general in command of the Army was received by that officer , then at Jalapa , on the 7th of May , 1847 , together with the dispatch from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico , having been transmitted to him from Vera Cruz . The commissioner arrived at the headquarters of the Army a few days afterwards . His presence with the Army and his diplomatic character were made known to the Mexican Government from Puebla on the 12th of June , 1847 , by the transmission of the dispatch from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico . Many weeks elapsed after its receipt , and no overtures were made nor was any desire expressed by the Mexican Government to enter into negotiations for peace . Our Army pursued its march upon the capital , and as it approached it was met by formidable resistance . Our forces first encountered the enemy , and achieved signal victories in the severely contested battles of Contreras and Churubusco . It was not until after these actions had resulted in decisive victories and the capital of the enemy was within our power that the Mexican Government manifested any disposition to enter into negotiations for peace , and even then , as events have proved , there is too much reason to believe they were insincere , and that in agreeing to go through the forms of negotiation the object was to gain time to strengthen the defenses of their capital and to prepare for fresh resistance . The general in command of the Army deemed it expedient to suspend hostilities temporarily by entering into an armistice with a view to the opening of negotiations . Commissioners were appointed on the part of Mexico to meet the commissioner on the part of the United States . The result of the conferences which took place between these functionaries of the two Governments was a failure to conclude a treaty of peace . The commissioner of the United States took with him the project of a treaty already prepared , by the terms of which the indemnity required by the United States was a cession of territory . It is well known that the only indemnity which it is in the power of Mexico to make in satisfaction of the just and long deferred claims of our citizens against her and the only means by which she can reimburse the United States for the expenses of the war is a cession to the United States of a portion of her territory . Mexico has no money to pay , and no other means of making the required indemnity . If we refuse this , we can obtain nothing else . To reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession of territory would be to abandon all our just demands , and to wage the war , bearing all its expenses , without a purpose or definite object . A state of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the belligerents and a treaty of peace puts an end to all claims for indemnity for tortious acts committed under the authority of one government against the citizens or subjects of another unless they are provided for in its stipulations . A treaty of peace which would terminate the existing war without providing for indemnity would enable Mexico , the acknowledged debtor and herself the aggressor in the war , to relieve herself from her just liabilities . By such a treaty our citizens who hold just demands against her would have no remedy either against Mexico or their own Government . Our duty to these citizens must forever prevent such a peace , and no treaty which does not provide ample means of discharging these demands can receive my sanction . A treaty of peace should settle all existing differences between the two countries . If an adequate cession of territory should be made by such a treaty , the United States should release Mexico from all her liabilities and assume their payment to our own citizens . If instead of this the United States were to consent to a treaty by which Mexico should again engage to pay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to our Government and our citizens would impose on her , it is notorious that she does not possess the means to meet such an undertaking . From such a treaty no result could be anticipated but the same irritating disappointments which have heretofore attended the violations of similar treaty stipulations on the part of Mexico . Such a treaty would be but a temporary cessation of hostilities , without the restoration of the friendship and good understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between the two countries . That Congress contemplated the acquisition of territorial indemnity when that body made provision for the prosecution of the war is obvious . Congress could not have meant when , in May , 1846 , they appropriated 10 , 000 , 000 and authorized the President to employ the militia and naval and military forces of the United States and to accept the services of 50 , 000 volunteers to enable him to prosecute the war , and when , at their last session , and after our Army had invaded Mexico , they made additional appropriations and authorized the raising of additional troops for the same purpose , that no indemnity was to be obtained from Mexico at the conclusion of the war and yet it was certain that if no Mexican territory was acquired no indemnity could be obtained . It is further manifest that Congress contemplated territorial indemnity from the fact that at their last session an act was passed , upon the Executive recommendation , appropriating 3 , 000 , 000 with that express object . This appropriation was made to enable the President to conclude a treaty of peace , limits , and boundaries with the Republic of Mexico , to be used by him in the event that said treaty , when signed by the authorized agents of the two Governments and duly ratified by Mexico , shall call for the expenditure of the same or any part thereof . The object of asking this appropriation was distinctly stated in the several messages on the subject which I communicated to Congress . Similar appropriations made in 1803 and 1806 , which were referred to , were intended to be applied in part consideration for the cession of Louisiana and the Floridas . In like manner it was anticipated that in settling the terms of a treaty of limits and boundaries with Mexico a cession of territory estimated to be of greater value than the amount of our demands against her might be obtained , and that the prompt payment of this sum in part consideration for the territory ceded , on the conclusion of a treaty and its ratification on her part , might be an inducement with her to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the United States and although the failure to conclude such a treaty has rendered it unnecessary to use any part of the 3 , 000 , 000 appropriated by that act , and the entire sum remains in the Treasury , it is still applicable to that object should the contingency occur making such application proper . The doctrine of no territory is the doctrine of no indemnity , and if sanctioned would be a public acknowledgment that our country was wrong and that the war declared by Congress with extraordinary unanimity was unjust and should be abandoned an admission unfounded in fact and degrading to the national character . The terms of the treaty proposed by the United States were not only just to Mexico , but , considering the character and amount of our claims , the unjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostilities by her , the expenses of the war to which we have been subjected , and the success which had attended our arms , were deemed to be of a most liberal character . The commissioner of the United States was authorized to agree to the establishment of the Rio Grande as the boundary from its entrance into the Gulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of New Mexico , in north latitude about 32 degree , and to obtain a cession to the United States of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias and the privilege of the right of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . The boundary of the Rio Grande and the cession to the United States of New Mexico and Upper California constituted an ultimatum which our commissioner was under no circumstances to yield . That it might be manifest , not only to Mexico , but to all other nations , that the United States were not disposed to take advantage of a feeble power by insisting upon wrestling from her all the other Provinces , including many of her principal towns and cities , which we had conquered and held in our military occupation but were willing to conclude a treaty in a spirit of liberality , our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the restoration to Mexico of all our other conquests . As the territory to be acquired by the boundary proposed might be estimated to be of greater value than a fair equivalent for our just demands , our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of such additional pecuniary consideration as was deemed reasonable . The terms of a treaty proposed by the Mexican commissioners were wholly inadmissible . They negotiated as if Mexico were the victorious , and not the vanquished , party . They must have known that their ultimatum could never be accepted . It required the United States to dismember Texas by surrendering to Mexico that part of the territory of that State lying between the Nueces and the Rio Grande , included within her limits by her laws when she was an independent republic , and when she was annexed to the United States and admitted by Congress as one of the States of our Union . It contained no provision for the payment by Mexico of the just claims of our citizens . It required indemnity to Mexican citizens for injuries they may have sustained by our troops in the prosecution of the war . It demanded the right for Mexico to levy and collect the Mexican tariff of duties on goods imported into her ports while in our military occupation during the war , and the owners of which had paid to officers of the United States the military contributions which had been levied upon them and it offered to cede to the United States , for a pecuniary consideration , that part of Upper California lying north of latitude 37 deg . Such were the unreasonable terms proposed by the Mexican commissioners . The cession to the United States by Mexico of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias , as proposed by the commissioner of the United States , it was believed would be more in accordance with the convenience and interests of both nations than any other cession of territory which it was probable Mexico could be induced to make . It is manifest to all who have observed the actual condition of the Mexican Government for some years past and at present that if these Provinces should be retained by her she could not long continue to hold and govern them . Mexico is too feeble a power to govern these Provinces , lying as they do at a distance of more than 1 , 000 miles from her capital , and if attempted to be retained by her they would constitute but for a short time even nominally a part of her dominions . This would be especially the case with Upper California . The sagacity of powerful European nations has long since directed their attention to the commercial importance of that Province , and there can be little doubt that the moment the United States shall relinquish their present occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort would be made by some foreign power to possess it , either by conquest or by purchase . If no foreign government should acquire it in either of these modes , an independent revolutionary government would probably be established by the inhabitants and such foreigners as may remain in or remove to the country as soon as it shall be known that the United States have abandoned it . Such a government would be too feeble long to maintain its separate independent existence , and would finally become annexed to or be a dependent colony of some more powerful state . Should any foreign government attempt to possess it as a colony , or otherwise to incorporate it with itself , the principle avowed by President Monroe in 1824 , and reaffirmed in my first annual message , that no foreign power shall with our consent be permitted to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on any part of the North American continent must be maintained . In maintaining this principle and in resisting its invasion by any foreign power we might be involved in other wars more expensive and more difficult than that in which we are now engaged . The Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias are contiguous to the territories of the United States , and if brought under the government of our laws their resources mineral , agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial would soon be developed . Upper California is bounded on the north by our Oregon possessions , and if held by the United States would soon be settled by a hardy , enterprising , and intelligent portion of our population . The Bay of San Francisco and other harbors along the Californian coast would afford shelter for our Navy , for our numerous whale ships , and other merchant vessels employed in the Pacific Ocean , and would in a short period become the marts of an extensive and profitable commerce with China and other countries of the East . These advantages , in which the whole commercial world would participate , would at once be secured to the United States by the cession of this territory while it is certain that as long as it remains a part of the Mexican dominions they can be enjoyed neither by Mexico herself nor by any other nation . New Mexico is a frontier Province , and has never been of any considerable value to Mexico . From its locality it is naturally connected with our Western settlements . The territorial limits of the State of Texas , too , as defined by her laws before her admission into our Union , embrace all that portion of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande , while Mexico still claims to hold this territory as a part of her dominions . The adjustment of this question of boundary is important . There is another consideration which induced the belief that the Mexican Government might even desire to place this Province under the protection of the Government of the United States . Numerous bands of fierce and warlike savages wander over it and upon its borders . Mexico has been and must continue to be too feeble to restrain them from committing depredations , robberies , and murders , not only upon the inhabitants of New Mexico itself , but upon those of the other northern States of Mexico . It would be a blessing to all these northern States to have their citizens protected against them by the power of the United States . At this moment many Mexicans , principally females and children , are in captivity among them . If New Mexico were held and governed by the United States , we could effectually prevent these tribes from committing such outrages , and compel them to release these captives and restore them to their families and friends . In proposing to acquire New Mexico and the Californias , it was known that but an inconsiderable portion of the Mexican people would be transferred with them , the country embraced within these Provinces being chiefly an uninhabited region . These were the leading considerations which induced me to authorize the terms of peace which were proposed to Mexico . They were rejected , and , negotiations being at an end , hostilities were renewed . An assault was made by our gallant Army upon the strongly fortified places near the gates of the City of Mexico and upon the city itself , and after several days of severe conflict the Mexican forces , vastly superior in number to our own , were driven from the city , and it was occupied by our troops . Immediately after information was received of the unfavorable result of the negotiations , believing that his continued presence with the Army could be productive of no good , I determined to recall our commissioner . A dispatch to this effect was transmitted to him on the 6th of October last . The Mexican Government will be informed of his recall , and that in the existing state of things I shall not deem it proper to make any further overtures of peace , but shall be at all times ready to receive and consider any proposals which may be made by Mexico . Since the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be made , in April last , large expenditures have been incurred and the precious blood of many of our patriotic fellow citizens has been shed in the prosecution of the war . This consideration and the obstinate perseverance of Mexico in protracting the war must influence the terms of peace which it may be deemed proper hereafter to accept . Our arms having been everywhere victorious , having subjected to our military occupation a large portion of the enemy s country , including his capital , and negotiations for peace having failed , the important questions arise , in what manner the war ought to be prosecuted and what should be our future policy . I can not doubt that we should secure and render available the conquests which we have already made , and that with this view we should hold and occupy by our naval and military forces all the ports , towns , cities , and Provinces now in our occupation or which may hereafter fall into our possession that we should press forward our military operations and levy such military contributions on the enemy as may , as far as practicable , defray the future expenses of the war . Had the Government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and liberal terms proposed , that mode of adjustment would have been preferred , Mexico having declined to do this and failed to offer any other terms which could be accepted by the United States , the national honor , no less than the public interests , requires that the war should be prosecuted with increased energy and power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtained . In the meantime , as Mexico refuses all indemnity , we should adopt measures to indemnify ourselves by appropriating permanently a portion of her territory . Early after the commencement of the war New Mexico and the Californias were taken possession of by our forces . Our military and naval commanders were ordered to conquer and hold them , subject to be disposed of by a treaty of peace . These Provinces are now in our undisputed occupation , and have been so for many months , all resistance on the part of Mexico having ceased within their limits . I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to Mexico . Should Congress concur with me in this opinion , and that they should be retained by the United States as indemnity , I can perceive no good reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the United States should not at once be extended over them . To wait for a treaty of peace such as we are willing to make , by which our relations toward them would not be changed , can not be good policy whilst our own interest and that of the people inhabiting them require that a stable , responsible , and free government under our authority should as soon as possible be established over them . Should Congress , therefore , determine to hold these Provinces permanently , and that they shall hereafter be considered as constituent parts of our country , the early establishment of Territorial governments over them will be important for the more perfect protection of persons and property and I recommend that such Territorial governments be established . It will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitants , by allaying all apprehension that they may still entertain of being again subjected to the jurisdiction of Mexico . I invite the early and favorable consideration of Congress to this important subject . Besides New Mexico and the Californias , there are other Mexican Provinces which have been reduced to our possession by conquest . These other Mexican Provinces are now governed by our military and naval commanders under the general authority which is conferred upon a conqueror by the laws of war . They should continue to be held , as a means of coercing Mexico to accede to just terms of peace . Civil as well as military officers are required to conduct such a government . Adequate compensation , to be drawn from contributions levied on the enemy , should be fixed by law for such officers as may be thus employed . What further provision may become necessary and what final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the future progress of the war and the course which Mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue . With the views I entertain I can not favor the policy which has been suggested , either to withdraw our Army altogether or to retire to a designated line and simply hold and defend it . To withdraw our Army altogether from the conquests they have made by deeds of unparalleled bravery , and at the expense of so much blood and treasure , in a just war on our part , and one which , by the act of the enemy , we could not honorably have avoided , would be to degrade the nation in its own estimation and in that of the world . To retire to a line and simply hold and defend it would not terminate the war . On the contrary , it would encourage Mexico to persevere and tend to protract it indefinitely . It is not to be expected that Mexico , after refusing to establish such a line as a permanent boundary when our victorious Army are in possession of her capital and in the heart of her country , would permit us to hold it without resistance . That she would continue the war , and in the most harassing and annoying forms , there can be no doubt . A border warfare of the most savage character , extending over a long line , would be unceasingly waged . It would require a large army to be kept constantly in the field , stationed at posts and garrisons along such a line , to protect and defend it . The enemy , relieved from the pressure of our arms on his coasts and in the populous parts of the interior , would direct his attention to this line , and , selecting an isolated post for attack , would concentrate his forces upon it . This would be a condition of affairs which the Mexicans , pursuing their favorite system of guerrilla warfare , would probably prefer to any other . Were we to assume a defensive attitude on such a line , all the advantages of such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy . We could levy no contributions upon him , or in any other way make him feel the pressure of the war , but must remain inactive and await his approach , being in constant uncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an assault . He may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior on his own side of the line , and , concealing his purpose , make a sudden assault upon some one of our posts so distant from any other as to prevent the possibility of timely succor or reenforcements , and in this way our gallant Army would be exposed to the danger of being cut off in detail or if by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibited during this war they should repulse the enemy , their numbers stationed at any one post may be too small to pursue him . If the enemy be repulsed in one attack , he would have nothing to do but to retreat to his own side of the line , and , being in no fear of a pursuing army , may reenforce himself at leisure for another attack on the same or some other post . He may , too , cross the line between our posts , make rapid incursions into the country which we hold , murder the inhabitants , commit depredations on them , and then retreat to the interior before a sufficient force can be concentrated to pursue him . Such would probably be the harassing character of a mere defensive war on our part . If our forces when attacked , or threatened with attack , be permitted to cross the line , drive back the enemy , and conquer him , this would be again to invade the enemy s country after having lost all the advantages of the conquests we have already made by having voluntarily abandoned them . To hold such a line successfully and in security it is far from being certain that it would not require as large an army as would be necessary to hold all the conquests we have already made and to continue the prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy s country . It is also far from being certain that the expenses of the war would be diminished by such a policy . I am persuaded that the best means of vindicating the national honor and interest and of bringing the war to an honorable close will be to prosecute it with increased energy and power in the vital parts of the enemy s country . In my annual message to Congress of December last I declared that The war has not been waged with a view to conquest , but , having been commenced by Mexico , it has been carried into the enemy s country and will be vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace , and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war , as well as to our much injured citizens , who hold large pecuniary demands against Mexico . Such , in my judgment , continues to be our true policy indeed , the only policy which will probably secure a permanent peace . It has never been contemplated by me , as an object of the war , to make a permanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico or to annihilate her separate existence as an independent nation . On the contrary , it has ever been my desire that she should maintain her nationality , and under a good government adapted to her condition be a free , independent , and prosperous Republic . The United States were the first among the nations to recognize her independence , and have always desired to be on terms of amity and good neighborhood with her . This she would not suffer . By her own conduct we have been compelled to engage in the present war . In its prosecution we seek not her overthrow as a nation , but in vindicating our national honor we seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done us and indemnity for our just demands against her . We demand an honorable peace , and that peace must bring with it indemnity for the past and security for the future . Hitherto Mexico has refused all accommodation by which such a peace could be obtained . Whilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory from the commencement of the war , it has always been with the olive branch of peace in their hands , and it has been in the power of Mexico at every step to arrest hostilities by accepting it . One great obstacle to the attainment of peace has undoubtedly arisen from the fact that Mexico has been so long held in subjection by one faction or military usurper after another , and such has been the condition of insecurity in which their successive governments have been placed that each has been deterred from making peace lest for this very cause a rival faction might expel it from power . Such was the fate of President Herrera s administration in 1845 for being disposed even to listen to the overtures of the United States to prevent the war , as is fully confirmed by an official correspondence which took place in the month of August last between him and his Government , a copy of which is herewith communicated . For this cause alone the revolution which displaced him from power was set on foot by General Paredes . Such may be the condition of insecurity of the present Government . There can be no doubt that the peaceable and well disposed inhabitants of Mexico are convinced that it is the true interest of their country to conclude an honorable peace with the United States , but the apprehension of becoming the victims of some military faction or usurper may have prevented them from manifesting their feelings by any public act . The removal of any such apprehension would probably cause them to speak their sentiments freely and to adopt the measures necessary for the restoration of peace . With a people distracted and divided by contending factions and a Government subject to constant changes by successive revolutions , the continued successes of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace . In such event it may become proper for our commanding generals in the field to give encouragement and assurances of protection to the friends of peace in Mexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government of their own choice , able and willing to conclude a peace which would be just to them and secure to us the indemnity we demand . This may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace . Should such be the result , the war which Mexico has forced upon us would thus be converted into an enduring blessing to herself . After finding her torn and distracted by factions , and ruled by military usurpers , we should then leave her with a republican government in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and prosperity , performing all her relative duties in the great family of nations and promoting her own happiness by wise laws and their faithful execution . If , after affording this encouragement and protection , and after all the persevering and sincere efforts we have made from the moment Mexico commenced the war , and prior to that time , to adjust our differences with her , we shall ultimately fail , then we shall have exhausted all honorable means in pursuit of peace , and must continue to occupy her country with our troops , taking the full measure of indemnity into our own hands , and must enforce the terms which our honor demands . To act otherwise in the existing state of things in Mexico , and to withdraw our Army without a peace , would not only leave all the wrongs of which we complain unredressed , but would be the signal for new and fierce civil dissensions and new revolutions all alike hostile to peaceful relations with the United States . Besides , there is danger , if our troops were withdrawn before a peace was conducted , that the Mexican people , wearied with successive revolutions and deprived of protection for their persons and property , might at length be inclined to yield to foreign influences and to cast themselves into the arms of some European monarch for protection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue . This , for our own safety and in pursuance of our established policy , we should be compelled to resist . We could never consent that Mexico should be thus converted into a monarchy governed by a foreign prince . Mexico is our near neighbor , and her boundaries are coterminous with our own through the whole extent across the North American continent , from ocean to ocean . Both politically and commercially we have the deepest interest in her regeneration and prosperity . Indeed , it is impossible that , with any just regard to our own safety , we can ever become indifferent to her fate . It may be that the Mexican Government and people have misconstrued or misunderstood our forbearance and our objects in desiring to conclude an amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the two countries . They may have supposed that we would submit to terms degrading to the nation , or they may have drawn false inferences from the supposed division of opinion in the United States on the subject of the war , and may have calculated to gain much by protracting it , and , indeed , that we might ultimately abandon it altogether without insisting on any indemnity , territorial or otherwise . Whatever may be the false impressions under which they have acted , the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy proposed must soon undeceive them . In the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be made to feel its pressure more than they have heretofore done . At its commencement it was deemed proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality . With this end in view , early measures were adopted to conciliate , as far as a state of war would permit , the mass of the Mexican population to convince them that the war was waged , not against the peaceful inhabitants of Mexico , but against their faithless Government , which had commenced hostilities to remove from their minds the false impressions which their designing and interested rulers had artfully attempted to make , that the war on our part was one of conquest , that it was a war against their religion and their churches , which were to be desecrated and overthrown , and that their rights of person and private property would be violated . To remove these false impressions , our commanders in the field were directed scrupulously to respect their religion , their churches , and their church property , which were in no manner to be violated they were directed also to respect the rights of persons and property of all who should not take up arms against us . Assurances to this effect were given to the Mexican people by Major General Taylor in a proclamation issued in pursuance of instructions from the Secretary of War in the month of June , 1846 , and again by Major General Scott , who acted upon his own convictions of the propriety of issuing it , in a proclamation of the 11th of May , 1847 . In this spirit of liberality and conciliation , and with a view to prevent the body of the Mexican population from taking up arms against us , was the war conducted on our part . Provisions and other supplies furnished to our Army by Mexican citizens were paid for at fair and liberal prices , agreed upon by the parties . After the lapse of a few months it became apparent that these assurances and this mild treatment had failed to produce the desired effect upon the Mexican population . While the war had been conducted on our part according to the most humane and liberal principles observed by civilized nations , it was waged in a far different spirit on the part of Mexico . Not appreciating our forbearance , the Mexican people generally became hostile to the United States , and availed themselves of every opportunity to commit the most savage excesses upon our troops . Large numbers of the population took up arms , and , engaging in guerrilla warfare , robbed and murdered in the most cruel manner individual soldiers or small parties whom accident or other causes had separated from the main body of our Army bands of guerrilleros and robbers infested the roads , harassed our trains , and whenever it was in their power cut off our supplies . The Mexicans having thus shown themselves to be wholly incapable of appreciating our forbearance and liberality , it was deemed proper to change the manner of conducting the war , by making them feel its pressure according to the usages observed under similar circumstances by all other civilized nations . Accordingly , as early as the 22d of September , 1846 , instructions were given by the Secretary of War to Major General Taylor to draw supplies for our Army from the enemy without paying for them , and to require contributions for its support , if in that way he was satisfied he could get abundant supplies for his forces . In directing the execution of these instructions much was necessarily left to the discretion of the commanding officer , who was best acquainted with the circumstances by which he was surrounded , the wants of the Army , and the practicability of enforcing the measure . General Taylor , on the 26th of October , 1846 , replied from Monterey that it would have been impossible hitherto , and is so now , to sustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of money or supplies . For the reasons assigned by him , he did not adopt the policy of his instructions , but declared his readiness to do so should the Army in its future operations reach a portion of the country which may be made to supply the troops with advantage . He continued to pay for the articles of supply which were drawn from the enemy s country . Similar instructions were issued to Major General Scott on the 3d of April , 1847 , who replied from Jalapa on the 20th of May , 1847 , that if it be expected that the Army is to support itself by forced contributions levied upon the country we may ruin and exasperate the inhabitants and starve ourselves . The same discretion was given to him that had been to General Taylor in this respect . General Scott , for the reasons assigned by him , also continued to pay for the articles of supply for the Army which were drawn from the enemy . After the Army had reached the heart of the most wealthy portion of Mexico it was supposed that the obstacles which had before that time prevented it would not be such as to render impracticable the levy of forced contributions for its support , and on the 1st of September and again on the 6th of October , 1847 , the order was repeated in dispatches addressed by the Secretary of War to General Scott , and his attention was again called to the importance of making the enemy bear the burdens of the war by requiring them to furnish the means of supporting our Army , and he was directed to adopt this policy unless by doing so there was danger of depriving the Army of the necessary supplies . Copies of these dispatches were forwarded to General Taylor for his government . On the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military and naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico in our military occupation , and to apply such contributions toward defraying the expenses of the war . By virtue of the right of conquest and the laws of war , the conqueror , consulting his own safety or convenience , may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such ports or permit it upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe . Before the principal ports of Mexico were blockaded by our Navy the revenue derived from import duties under the laws of Mexico was paid into the Mexican treasury . After these ports had fallen into our military possession the blockade was raised and commerce with them permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions . They were opened to the trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate in their amount than those which had been previously levied by Mexico , and the revenue , which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury , was directed to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied to the use of our Army and Navy . Care was taken that the officers , soldiers , and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the operations of the order , and , as the merchandise imported upon which the order operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens , the contributions exacted were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the application of them to our own use . In directing this measure the object was to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expenses of the war . For the amount of contributions which have been levied in this form I refer you to the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and of the Secretary of the Navy , by which it appears that a sum exceeding half a million of dollars has been collected . This amount would undoubtedly have been much larger but for the difficulty of keeping open communications between the coast and the interior , so as to enable the owners of the merchandise imported to transport and vend it to the inhabitants of the country . It is confidently expected that this difficulty will to a great extent be soon removed by our increased forces which have been sent to the field . Measures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the external revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation will be seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy . The policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form consistently with the laws of nations , which it may be practicable for our military commanders to adopt , should , in my judgment , be rigidly enforced , and orders to this effect have accordingly been given . By such a policy , at the same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a heavy drain , the Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the war , and , consulting their own interests , may be induced the more readily to require their rulers to accede to a just peace . After the adjournment of the last session of Congress events transpired in the prosecution of the war which in my judgment required a greater number of troops in the field than had been anticipated . The strength of the Army was accordingly increased by accepting the services of all the volunteer forces authorized by the act of the 13th of May , 1846 , without putting a construction on that act the correctness of which was seriously questioned . The volunteer forces now in the field , with those which had been accepted to serve for twelve months and were discharged at the end of their term of service , exhaust the 50 , 000 men authorized by that act . Had it been clear that a proper construction of the act warranted it , the services of an additional number would have been called for and accepted but doubts existing upon this point , the power was not exercised . It is deemed important that Congress should at an early period of their session confer the authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war with Mexico and to be discharged upon the conclusion and ratification of a treaty of peace . I invite the attention of Congress to the views presented by the Secretary of War in his report upon this subject . I recommend also that authority be given by law to call for and accept the services of an additional number of volunteers , to be exercised at such time and to such extent as the emergencies of the service may require . In prosecuting the war with Mexico , whilst the utmost care has been taken to avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nations , and none has been given , liberal privileges have been granted to their commerce in the ports of the enemy in our military occupation . The difficulty with the Brazilian Government , which at one time threatened to interrupt the friendly relations between the two countries , will , I trust , be speedily adjusted . I have received information that an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United States will shortly be appointed by His Imperial Majesty , and it is hoped that he will come instructed and prepared to adjust all remaining differences between the two Governments in a manner acceptable and honorable to both . In the meantime , I have every reason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable relations with Brazil . It has been my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate relations of friendship with all the independent powers of South America , and this policy has been attended with the happiest results . It is true that the settlement and payment of many just claims of American citizens against these nations have been long delayed . The peculiar position in which they have been placed and the desire on the part of my predecessors as well as myself to grant them the utmost indulgence have hitherto prevented these claims from being urged in a manner demanded by strict justice . The time has arrived when they ought to be finally adjusted and liquidated , and efforts are now making for that purpose . It is proper to inform you that the Government of Peru has in good faith paid the first two installments of the indemnity of 30 , 000 each , and the greater portion of the interest due thereon , in execution of the convention between that Government and the United States the ratifications of which were exchanged at Lima on the 31st of October , 1846 . The Attorney General of the United States early in August last completed the adjudication of the claims under this convention , and made his report thereon in pursuance of the act of the 8th of August , 1846 . The sums to which the claimants are respectively entitled will be paid on demand at the Treasury . I invite the early attention of Congress to the present condition of our citizens in China . Under our treaty with that power American citizens are withdrawn from the jurisdiction , whether civil or criminal , of the Chinese Government and placed under that of our public functionaries in that country . By these alone can our citizens be tried and punished for the commission of any crime by these alone can questions be decided between them involving the rights of persons and property , and by these alone can contracts be enforced into which they may have entered with the citizens or subjects of foreign powers . The merchant vessels of the United States lying in the waters of the five ports of China open to foreign commerce are under the exclusive jurisdiction of officers of their own Government . Until Congress shall establish competent tribunals to try and punish crimes and to exercise jurisdiction in civil cases in China , American citizens there are subject to no law whatever . Crimes may be committed with impunity and debts may be contracted without any means to enforce their payment . Inconveniences have already resulted from the omission of Congress to legislate upon the subject , and still greater are apprehended . The British authorities in China have already complained that this Government has not provided for the punishment of crimes or the enforcement of contracts against American citizens in that country , whilst their Government has established tribunals by which an American citizen can recover debts due from British subjects . Accustomed , as the Chinese are , to summary justice , they could not be made to comprehend why criminals who are citizens of the United States should escape with impunity , in violation of treaty obligations , whilst the punishment of a Chinese who had committed any crime against an American citizen would be rigorously exacted . Indeed , the consequences might be fatal to American citizens in China should a flagrant crime be committed by any one of them upon a Chinese , and should trial and punishment not follow according to the requisitions of the treaty . This might disturb , if not destroy , our friendly relations with that Empire , and cause an interruption of our valuable commerce . Our treaties with the Sublime Porte , Tripoli , Tunis , Morocco , and Muscat also require the legislation of Congress to carry them into execution , though the necessity for immediate action may not be so urgent as in regard to China . The Secretary of State has submitted an estimate to defray the expense of opening diplomatic relations with the Papal States . The interesting political events now in progress in these States , as well as a just regard to our commercial interests , have , in my opinion , rendered such a measure highly expedient . Estimates have also been submitted for the outfits and salaries of charges d affaires to the Republics of Bolivia , Guatemala , and Ecuador . The manifest importance of cultivating the most friendly relations with all the independent States upon this continent has induced me to recommend appropriations necessary for the maintenance of these missions . I recommend to Congress that an appropriation be made to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants in the Amistad case . I entertain the conviction that this is due to Spain under the treaty of the 20th of October , 1795 , and , moreover , that from the earnest manner in which the claim continues to be urged so long as it shall remain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and discord between the two countries , which may prove highly prejudicial to the interests of the United States . Good policy , no less than a faithful compliance with our treaty obligations , requires that the inconsiderable appropriation demanded should be made . A detailed statement of the condition of the finances will be presented in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury . The imports for the last fiscal year , ending on the 30th of June , 1847 , were of the value of 146 , 545 , 638 , of which the amount exported was 8 , 011 , 158 , leaving 138 , 534 , 480 in the country for domestic use . The value of the exports for the same period was 158 , 648 , 622 , of which 150 , 637 , 464 consisted of domestic productions and 8 , 011 , 158 of foreign articles . The receipts into the Treasury for the same period amounted to 26 , 346 , 790 . 37 , of which there was derived from customs 23 , 747 , 864 . 66 , from sales of public lands 2 , 498 , 335 . 20 , and from incidental and miscellaneous sources 100 , 570 . 51 . The last fiscal year , during which this amount was received , embraced five months under the operation of the tariff act of 1842 and seven months during which the tariff act of 1846 was in force . During the five months under the act of 1842 the amount received from customs was 7 , 842 , 306 . 90 , and during the seven months under the act of 1846 the amount received was 15 , 905 , 557 . 76 . The net revenue from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December , 1846 , being the last year under the operation of the tariff act of 1842 , was 22 , 971 , 403 . 10 , and the net revenue from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December , 1847 , being the first year under the operations of the tariff act of 1846 , was about 31 , 500 , 000 , being an increase of revenue for the first year under the tariff of 1846 of more than 8 , 500 , 000 over that of the last year under the tariff of 1842 . The expenditures during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were 59 , 451 , 177 . 65 , of which 3 , 522 , 082 . 37 was on account payment of principal and interest of the public debt , including Treasury notes redeemed and not funded . The expenditures exclusive of payment of public debt were 55 , 929 , 095 . 28 . It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June , 1848 , including the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last , will amount to 42 , 886 , 545 . 80 , of which 31 , 000 , 000 , it is estimated , will be derived from customs , 3 , 500 , 000 from the sale of the public lands , 400 , 000 from incidental sources , eluding sales made by the Solicitor of the Treasury , and 6 , 285 , 294 . 55 from loans already authorized by law , which , together with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last , make the sum estimated . The expenditures for the same period , if peace with Mexico shall not be concluded and the Army shall be increased as is proposed , will amount , including the necessary payments on account of principal and interest of the public debt and Treasury notes , to 58 , 615 , 660 . 07 . On the 1st of the present month the amount of the public debt actually incurred , including Treasury notes , was 45 , 659 , 659 . 40 . The public debt due on the 4th of March , 1845 , including Treasury notes , was 17 , 788 , 799 . 62 , and consequently the addition made to the public debt since that time is 27 , 870 , 859 . 78 . Of the loan of twenty three millions authorized by the act of the 28th of January , 1847 , the sum of five millions was paid out to the public creditors or exchanged at par for specie the remaining eighteen millions was offered for specie to the highest bidder not below par , by an advertisement issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and published from the 9th of February until the 10th of April , 1847 , when it was awarded to the several highest bidders at premiums varying from one eighth of per cent to 2 per cent above par . The premium has been paid into the Treasury and the sums awarded deposited in specie in the Treasury as fast as it was required by the wants of the Government . To meet the expenditures for the remainder of the present and for the next fiscal year , ending on the 30th of June , 1849 , a further loan in aid of the ordinary revenues of the Government will be necessary . Retaining a sufficient surplus in the Treasury , the loan required for the remainder of the present fiscal year will be about 18 , 500 , 000 . If the duty on tea and coffee be imposed and the graduation of the price of the public lands shall be made at an early period of your session , as recommended , the loan for the present fiscal year may be reduced to 17 , 000 , 000 . The loan may be further reduced by whatever amount of expenditures can be saved by military contributions collected in Mexico . The most vigorous measures for the augmentation of these contributions have been directed and a very considerable sum is expected from that source . Its amount can not , however , be calculated with any certainty . It is recommended that the loan to be made be authorized upon the same terms and for the same time as that which was authorized under the provisions of the act of the 28th of January , 1847 . Should the war with Mexico be continued until the 30th of June , 1849 , it is estimated that a further loan of 20 , 500 , 000 will be required for the fiscal year ending on that day , in case no duty be imposed on tea and coffee , and the public lands be not reduced and graduated in price , and no military contributions shall be collected in Mexico . If the duty on tea and coffee be imposed and the lands be reduced and graduated in price as proposed , the loan may be reduced to 17 , 000 , 000 , and will be subject to be still further reduced by the amount of the military contributions which may be collected in Mexico . It is not proposed , however , at present to ask Congress for authority to negotiate this loan for the next fiscal year , as it is hoped that the loan asked for the remainder of the present fiscal year , aided by military contributions which may be collected in Mexico , may be sufficient . If , contrary to my expectation , there should be a necessity for it , the fact will be communicated to Congress in time for their action during the present session . In no event will a sum exceeding 6 , 000 , 000 of this amount be needed before the meeting of the session of Congress in December , 1848 . The act of the 30th of July , 1846 , reducing the duties on imports , has been in force since the 1st of December last , and I am gratified to state that all the beneficial effects which were anticipated from its operation have been fully realized . The public revenue derived from customs during the year ending on the 1st of December , 1847 , exceeds by more than 8 , 000 , 000 the amount received in the preceding year under the operation of the act of 1842 , which was superseded and repealed by it . Its effects are visible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevails in every branch of business . While the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duties of the act of 1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rates levied on articles imported according to their actual value has increased the revenue and augmented our foreign trade , all the great interests of the country have been advanced and promoted . The great and important interests of agriculture , which had been not only too much neglected , but actually taxed under the protective policy for the benefit of other interests , have been relieved of the burdens which that policy imposed on them and our farmers and planters , under a more just and liberal commercial policy , are finding new and profitable markets abroad for their augmented products . Our commerce is rapidly increasing , and is extending more widely the circle of international exchanges . Great as has been the increase of our imports during the past year , our exports of domestic products sold in foreign markets have been still greater . Our navigating interest is eminently prosperous . The number of vessels built in the United States has been greater than during any preceding period of equal length . Large profits have been derived by those who have constructed as well as by those who have navigated them . Should the ratio of increase in the number of our merchant vessels be progressive , and be as great for the future as during the past year , the time is not distant when our tonnage and commercial marine will be larger than that of any other nation in the world . Whilst the interests of agriculture , of commerce , and of navigation have been enlarged and invigorated , it is highly gratifying to observe that our manufactures are also in a prosperous condition . None of the ruinous effects upon this interest which were apprehended by some as the result of the operation of the revenue system established by the act of 1846 have been experienced . On the contrary , the number of manufactories and the amount of capital invested in them is steadily and rapidly increasing , affording gratifying proofs that American enterprise and skill employed in this branch of domestic industry , with no other advantages than those fairly and incidentally accruing from a just System of revenue duties , are abundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still derive fair and remunerating profits . While capital invested in manufactures is yielding adequate and fair profits under the new system , the wages of labor , whether employed in manufactures , agriculture , commerce , or navigation , have been augmented . The toiling millions whose daily labor furnishes the supply of food and raiment and all the necessaries and comforts of life are receiving higher wages and more steady and permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous period of our own history . So successful have been all branches of our industry that a foreign war , which generally diminishes the resources of a nation , has in no essential degree retarded our onward progress or checked our general prosperity . With such gratifying evidences of prosperity and of the successful operation of the revenue act of 1846 , every consideration of public policy recommends that it shall remain unchanged . It is hoped that the system of impost duties which it established may be regarded as the permanent policy of the country , and that the great interests affected by it may not again be subject to be injuriously disturbed , as they have heretofore been by frequent and sometimes sudden changes . For the purpose of increasing the revenue , and without changing or modifying the rates imposed by the act of 1846 on the dutiable articles embraced by its provisions , I again recommend to your favorable consideration the expediency of levying a revenue duty on tea and coffee . The policy which exempted these articles from duty during peace , and when the revenue to be derived from them was not needed , ceases to exist when the country is engaged in war and requires the use of all of its available resources . It is a tax which would be so generally diffused among the people that it would be felt oppressively by none and be complained of by none . It is believed that there are not in the list of imported articles any which are more properly the subject of war duties than tea and coffee . It is estimated that 3 , 000 , 000 would be derived annually by a moderate duty imposed on these articles . Should Congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue , not only would the amount of the public loan rendered necessary by the war with Mexico be diminished to that extent , but the public credit and the public confidence in the ability and determination of the Government to meet all its engagements promptly would be more firmly established , and the reduced amount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate could probably be obtained at cheaper rates . Congress is therefore called upon to determine whether it is wiser to impose the war duties recommended or by omitting to do so increase the public debt annually 3 , 000 , 000 so long as loans shall be required to prosecute the war , and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the semiannual interest upon it , and ultimately to extinguish the principal . If in addition to these duties Congress should graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as experience has proved will not command the price placed upon them by the Government , an additional annual income to the Treasury of between half a million and a million of dollars , it is estimated , would be derived from this source . Should both measures receive the sanction of Congress , the annual amount of public debt necessary to be contracted during the continuance of the war would be reduced near 4 , 000 , 000 . The duties recommended to be levied on tea and coffee it is proposed shall be limited in their duration to the end of the war , and until the public debt rendered necessary to be contracted by it shall be discharged . The amount of the public debt to be contracted should be limited to the lowest practicable sum , and should be extinguished as early after the conclusion of the war as the means of the Treasury will permit . With this view , it is recommended that as soon as the war shall be over all the surplus in the Treasury not needed for other indispensable objects shall constitute a sinking fund and be applied to the purchase of the funded debt , and that authority be conferred by laws for that purpose . The act of the 6th of August , 1846 , to establish a warehousing system , has been in operation more than a year , and has proved to be an important auxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augmenting the revenue and extending the commerce of the country . Whilst it has tended to enlarge commerce , it has been beneficial to our manufactures by diminishing forced sales at auction of foreign goods at low prices to raise the duties to be advanced on them , and by checking fluctuations in the market . The system , although sanctioned by the experience of other countries , was entirely new in the United States , and is susceptible of improvement in some of its provisions . The Secretary of the Treasury , upon whom was devolved large discretionary powers in carrying this measure into effect , has collected and is now collating the practical results of the system in other countries where it has long been established , and will report at an early period of your session such further regulations suggested by the investigation as may render it still more effective and beneficial . By the act to provide for the better organization of the Treasury and for the collection , safe keeping , and disbursement of the public revenue all banks were discontinued as fiscal agents of the Government , and the paper currency issued by them was no longer permitted to be received in payment of public dues . The constitutional treasury created by this act went into operation on the 1st of January last . Under the system established by it the public moneys have been collected , safely kept , and disbursed by the direct agency of officers of the Government in gold and silver , and transfers of large amounts have been made from points of collection to points of disbursement without loss to the Treasury or injury or inconvenience to the trade of the country . While the fiscal operations of the Government have been conducted with regularity and ease under this system , it has had a salutary effect in checking and preventing an undue inflation of the paper currency issued by the banks which exist under State charters . Requiring , as it does , all dues to the Government to be paid in gold and silver , its effect is to restrain excessive issues of bank paper by the banks disproportioned to the specie in their vaults , for the reason that they are at all times liable to be called on by the holders of their notes for their redemption in order to obtain specie for the payment of duties and other public dues . The banks , therefore , must keep their business within prudent limits , and be always in a condition to meet such calls , or run the hazard of being compelled to suspend specie payments and be thereby discredited . The amount of specie imported into the United States during the last fiscal year was 24 , 121 , 289 , of which there was retained in the country 22 , 276 , 170 . Had the former financial system prevailed and the public moneys been placed on deposit in the banks , nearly the whole of this amount would have gone into their vaults , not to be thrown into circulation by them , but to be withheld from the hands of the people as a currency and made the basis of new and enormous issues of bank paper . A large proportion of the specie imported has been paid into the Treasury for public dues , and after having been to a great extent recoined at the Mint has been paid out to the public creditors and gone into circulation as a currency among the people . The amount of gold and silver coin now in circulation in the country is larger than at any former period . The financial system established by the constitutional treasury has been thus far eminently successful in its operations , and I recommend an adherence to all its essential provisions , and especially to that vital provision which wholly separates the Government from all connection with banks and excludes bank paper from all revenue receipts . In some of its details , not involving its general principles , the system is defective and will require modification . These defects and such amendments as are deemed important were set forth in the last annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury . These amendments are again recommended to the early and favorable consideration of Congress . During the past year the coinage at the Mint and its branches has exceeded 20 , 000 , 000 . This has consisted chiefly in converting the coins of foreign countries into American coin . The largest amount of foreign coin imported has been received at New York , and if a branch mint were established at that city all the foreign coin received at that port could at once be converted into our own coin without the expense , risk , and delay of transporting it to the Mint for that purpose , and the amount recoined would be much larger . Experience has proved that foreign coin , and especially foreign gold coin , will not circulate extensively as a currency among the people . The important measure of extending our specie circulation , both of gold and silver , and of diffusing it among the people can only be effected by converting such foreign coin into American coin . I repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message for the establishment of a branch of the Mint of the United States at the city of New York . All the public lands which had been surveyed and were ready for market have been proclaimed for sale during the past year . The quantity offered and to be offered for sale under proclamations issued since the 1st of January last amounts to 9 , 138 , 531 acres . The prosperity of the Western States and Territories in which these lands lie will be advanced by their speedy sale . By withholding them from market their growth and increase of population would be retarded , while thousands of our enterprising and meritorious frontier population would be deprived of the opportunity of securing freeholds for themselves and their families . But in addition to the general considerations which rendered the early sale of these lands proper , it was a leading object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from this source , and thus diminish by that amount the public loan rendered necessary by the existence of a foreign war . It is estimated that not less than 10 , 000 , 000 acres of the public lands will be surveyed and be in a condition to be proclaimed for sale during the year 1848 . In my last annual message I presented the reasons which in my judgment rendered it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as have remained unsold for long periods after they had been offered for sale at public auction . Many millions of acres of public lands lying within the limits of several of the Western States have been offered in the market and been subject to sale at private entry for more than twenty years and large quantities for more than thirty years at the lowest price prescribed by the existing laws , and it has been found that they will not command that price . They must remain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price demanded for them by the Government shall be reduced . No satisfactory reason is perceived why they should be longer held at rates above their real value . At the present period an additional reason exists for adopting the measure recommended . When the country is engaged in a foreign war , and we must necessarily resort to loans , it would seem to be the dictate of wisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our resources and thus limit the amount of the public indebtedness to the lowest possible sum . I recommend that the existing laws on the subject of preemption rights be amended and modified so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who may settle upon the public lands and make improvements upon them , before they are surveyed as well as afterwards , in all cases where such settlements may be made after the Indian title shall have been extinguished . If the right of preemption be thus extended , it will embrace a large and meritorious class of our citizens . It will increase the number of small freeholders upon our borders , who will be enabled thereby to educate their children and otherwise improve their condition , while they will be found at all times , as they have ever proved themselves to be in the hour of danger to their country , among our hardiest and best volunteer soldiers , ever ready to attend to their services in cases of emergencies and among the last to leave the field as long as an enemy remains to be encountered . Such a policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrants with deeper feelings of gratitude for the parental care of their Government , when they find their dearest interests secured to them by the permanent laws of the land and that they are no longer in danger of losing their homes and hard earned improvements by being brought into competition with a more wealthy class of purchasers at the land sales . The attention of Congress was invited at their last and the preceding session to the importance of establishing a Territorial government over our possessions in Oregon , and it is to be regretted that there was no legislation on the subject . Our citizens who inhabit that distant region of country are still left without the protection of our laws , or any regularly organized government . Before the question of limits and boundaries of the Territory of Oregon was definitely settled , from the necessity of their condition the inhabitants had established a temporary government of their own . Besides the want of legal authority for continuing such a government , it is wholly inadequate to protect them in their rights of person and property , or to secure to them the enjoyment of the privileges of other citizens , to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States . They should have the right of suffrage , be represented in a Territorial legislature and by a Delegate in Congress , and possess all the rights and privileges which citizens of other portions of the territories of the United States have heretofore enjoyed or may now enjoy . Our judicial system , revenue laws , laws regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes , and the protection of our laws generally should be extended over them . In addition to the inhabitants in that Territory who had previously emigrated to it , large numbers of our citizens have followed them during the present year , and it is not doubted that during the next and subsequent years their numbers will be greatly increased . Congress at its last session established post routes leading to Oregon , and between different points within that Territory , and authorized the establishment of post offices at Astoria and such other places on the coasts of the Pacific within the territory of the United States as the public interests may require . Post offices have accordingly been established , deputy postmasters appointed , and provision made for the transportation of the mails . The preservation of peace with the Indian tribes residing west of the Rocky Mountains will render it proper that authority should be given by law for the appointment of an adequate number of Indian agents to reside among them . I recommend that a surveyor general s office be established in that Territory , and that the public lands be surveyed and brought into market at an early period . I recommend also that grants , upon liberal terms , of limited quantities of the public lands be made to all citizens of the United States who have emigrated , or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate , to Oregon and settle upon them . These hardy and adventurous citizens , who have encountered the dangers and privations of a long and toilsome journey , and have at length found an abiding place for themselves and their families upon the utmost verge of our western limits , should be secured in the homes which they have improved by their labor . I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for a detailed account of the operations of the various branches of the public service connected with the Department under his charge . The duties devolving on this Department have been unusually onerous and responsible during the past year , and have been discharged with ability and success . Pacific relations continue to exist with the various Indian tribes , and most of them manifest a strong friendship for the United States . Some depredations were committed during the past year upon our trains transporting supplies for the Army , on the road between the western border of Missouri and Santa Fe . These depredations , which are supposed to have been committed by bands from the region of New Mexico , have been arrested by the presence of a military force ordered out for that purpose . Some outrages have been perpetrated by a portion of the northwestern bands upon the weaker and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribes . Prompt measures were taken to prevent such occurrences in future . Between 1 , 000 and 2 , 000 Indians , belonging to several tribes , have been removed during the year from the east of the Mississippi to the country allotted to them west of that river as their permanent home , and arrangements have been made for others to follow . Since the treaty of 1846 with the Cherokees the feuds among them appear to have subsided , and they have become more united and contented than they have been for many years past . The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the act of June 27 , 1846 , to settle claims arising under the treaty of 1835 36 with that tribe have executed their duties , and after a patient investigation and a full and fair examination of all the cases brought before them closed their labors in the month of July last . This is the fourth board of commissioners which has been organized under this treaty . Ample opportunity has been afforded to all those interested to bring forward their claims . No doubt is entertained that impartial justice has been done by the late board , and that all valid claims embraced by the treaty have been considered and allowed . This result and the final settlement to be made with this tribe under the treaty of 1846 , which will be completed and laid before you during your session , will adjust all questions of controversy between them and the United States and produce a state of relations with them simple , well defined , and satisfactory . Under the discretionary authority conferred by the act of the 3d of March last the annuities due to the various tribes have been paid during the present year to the heads of families instead of to their chiefs or such persons as they might designate , as required by the law previously existing . This mode of payment has given general satisfaction to the great body of the Indians . Justice has been done to them , and they are grateful to the Government for it . A few chiefs and interested persons may object to this mode of payment , but it is believed to be the only mode of preventing fraud and imposition from being practiced upon the great body of common Indians , constituting a majority of all the tribes . It is gratifying to perceive that a number of the tribes have recently manifested an increased interest in the establishment of schools among them , and are making rapid advances in agriculture , some of them producing a sufficient quantity of food for their support and in some cases a surplus to dispose of to their neighbors . The comforts by which those who have received even a very limited education and have engaged in agriculture are surrounded tend gradually to draw off their less civilized brethren from the precarious means of subsistence by the chase to habits of labor and civilization . The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a satisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operations of the naval service during the past year . Our commerce has been pursued with increased activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the globe under the protection of our flag , which the Navy has caused to be respected in the most distant seas . In the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific the officers and men of our squadrons have displayed distinguished gallantry and performed valuable services . In the early stages of the war with Mexico her ports on both coasts were blockaded , and more recently many of them have been captured and held by the Navy . When acting in cooperation with the land forces , the naval officers and men have performed gallant and distinguished services on land as well as on water , and deserve the high commendation of the country . While other maritime powers are adding to their navies large numbers of war steamers , it was a wise policy on our part to make similar additions to our Navy . The four war steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March , 1847 , are in course of construction . In addition to the four war steamers authorized by this act , the Secretary of the Navy has , in pursuance of its provisions , entered into contracts for the construction of five steamers to be employed in the transportation of the United States mail from New York to New Orleans , touching at Charleston , Savannah , and Havana , and from Havana to Chagres for three steamers to be employed in like manner from Panama to Oregon , so as to connect with the mail from Havana to Chagres across the Isthmus and for five steamers to be employed in like manner from New York to Liverpool . These steamers will be the property of the contractors , but are to be built under the superintendence and direction of a naval constructor in the employ of the Navy Department , and to be so constructed as to render them convertible at the least possible expense into war steamers of the first class . A prescribed number of naval officers , as well as a post office agent , are to be on board of them , and authority is reserved to the Navy Department at all times to exercise control over said steamships and to have the right to take them for the exclusive use and service of the United States upon making proper compensation to the contractors therefor . Whilst these steamships will be employed in transporting the mails of the United States coastwise and to foreign countries upon an annual compensation to be paid to the owners , they will be always ready , upon an emergency requiring it , to be converted into war steamers and the right reserved to take them for public use will add greatly to the efficiency and strength of this description of our naval force . To the steamers thus authorized under contracts made by the Secretary of the Navy should be added five other steamers authorized under contracts made in pursuance of laws by the Postmaster General , making an addition , in the whole , of eighteen war steamers subject to be taken for public use . As further contracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign countries may be authorized by Congress , this number may be enlarged indefinitely . The enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various distant parts of the globe is established , by means of American built sea steamers , would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce and in making our country and its resources more favorably known abroad but the national advantage is still greater of having our naval officers made familiar with steam navigation and of having the privilege of taking the ships already equipped for immediate service at a moment s notice , and will be cheaply purchased by the compensation to be paid for the transportation of the mail in them over and above the postages received . A just national pride , no less than our commercial interests , would Seem to favor the policy of augmenting the number of this description of vessels . They can be built in our country cheaper and in greater numbers than in any other in the world . I refer you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster General for a detailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of that Department during the past year . It is gratifying to find that within so short a period after the reduction in the rates of postage , and notwithstanding the great increase of mail service , the revenue received for the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses , and that no further aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose . The first of the American mail steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of March , 1845 , was completed and entered upon the service on the 1st of June last , and is now on her third voyage to Bremen and other intermediate ports . The other vessels authorized under the provisions of that act are in course of construction , and will be put upon the line as soon as completed . Contracts have also been made for the transportation of the mail in a steamer from Charleston to Havana . A reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement has been made by the Postmaster General with the authorities of Bremen , and no difficulty is apprehended in making similar arrangements with all other powers with which we may have communications by mail steamers , except with Great Britain . On the arrival of the first of the American steamers bound to Bremen at Southampton , in the month of June last , the British post office directed the collection of discriminating postages on all letters and other mailable matter which she took out to Great Britain or which went into the British post office on their way to France and other parts of Europe . The effect of the order of the British , post office is to subject all letters and other matter transported by American steamers to double postage , one postage having been previously paid on them to the United States , while letters transported in British steamers are subject to pay but a single postage . This measure was adopted with the avowed object of protecting the British line of mail steamers now running between Boston and Liverpool , and if permitted to Continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all letters and other matter by American steamers and give to British steamers a monopoly of the business . A just and fair reciprocity is all that we desire , and on this we must insist . By our laws no such discrimination is made against British steamers bringing letters into our ports , but all letters arriving in the United States are subject to the same rate of postage , whether brought in British or American vessels . I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for a full statement of the facts of the case and of the steps taken by him to correct this inequality . He has exerted all the power conferred upon him by the existing laws . The minister of the United States at London has brought the subject to the attention of the British Government , and is now engaged in negotiations for the purpose of adjusting reciprocal postal arrangements which shall be equally just to both countries . Should he fail in concluding such arrangements , and should Great Britain insist on enforcing the unequal and unjust measure she has adopted , it will become necessary to confer additional powers on the Postmaster General in order to enable him to meet the emergency and to put our own steamers on an equal footing with British steamers engaged in transporting the mails between the two countries , and I recommend that such powers be conferred . In view of the existing state of our country , I trust it may not be inappropriate , in closing this communication , to call to mind the words of wisdom and admonition of the first and most illustrious of my predecessors in his Farewell Address to his countrymen . That greatest and best of men , who served his country so long and loved it so much , foresaw with serious concern the danger to our Union of characterizing parties by geographical discriminations Northern and Southern , Atlantic and Western whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views , and warned his countrymen against it . So deep and solemn was his conviction of the importance of the Union and of preserving harmony between its different parts , that he declared to his countrymen in that address It is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial , habitual , and immovable attachment to it accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned , and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts . After the lapse of half a century these admonitions of Washington fall upon us with all the force of truth . It is difficult to estimate the immense value of our glorious Union of confederated States , to which we are so much indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for all that constitutes us a great and a happy nation . How unimportant are all our differences of opinion upon minor questions of public policy compared with its preservation , and how scrupulously should we avoid all agitating topics which may tend to distract and divide us into contending parties , separated by geographical lines , whereby it may be weakened or endangered . Invoking the blessing of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe upon your deliberations , it will be my highest duty , no less than my sincere pleasure , to cooperate with you in all measures which may tend to promote the honor and enduring welfare of our common country .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives I have considered the bill entitled An act making appropriations for the improvement of certain harbors and rivers with the care which its importance demands , and now return the same to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , with my objections to its becoming a law . The bill proposes to appropriate 1 , 378 , 450 to be applied to more than forty distinct and separate objects of improvement . On examining its provisions and the variety of objects of improvement which it embraces , many of them of a local character , it is difficult to conceive , if it shall be sanctioned and become a law , what practical constitutional restraint can hereafter be imposed upon the most extended system of internal improvements by the Federal Government in all parts of the Union . The Constitution has not , in my judgment , conferred upon the Federal Government the power to construct works of internal improvement within the States , or to appropriate money from the Treasury for that purpose . That this bill assumes for the Federal Government the right to exercise this power can not , I think , be doubted . The approved course of the Government and the deliberately expressed judgment of the people have denied the existence of such a power under the Constitution . Several of my predecessors have denied its existence in the most solemn forms . The general proposition that the Federal Government does not possess this power is so well settled and has for a considerable period been so generally acquiesced in that it is not deemed necessary to reiterate the arguments by which it is sustained . Nor do I deem it necessary , after the full and elaborate discussions which have taken place before the country on this subject , to do more than to state the general considerations which have satisfied me of the unconstitutionality and inexpediency of the exercise of such a power . It is not questioned that the Federal Government is one of limited powers . Its powers are such , and such only , as are expressly granted in the Constitution or are properly incident to the expressly granted powers and necessary to their execution . In determining whether a given power has been granted a sound rule of construction has been laid down by Madison . That rule is that Whenever a question arises concerning a particular power , the first question is whether the power be expressed in the Constitution . If it be , the question is decided . If it be not expressed , the next inquiry must be whether it is properly an incident to an expressed power and necessary to its execution . If it be , it may be exercised by Congress . If it be not , Congress can not exercise it . It is not pretended that there is any express grant in the Constitution conferring on Congress the power in question . Is it , then , an incidental power necessary and proper for the execution of any of the granted powers All the granted powers , it is confidently affirmed , may be effectually executed without the aid of such an incident . A power , to be incidental , must not be exercised for ends which make it a principal or substantive power , independent of the principal power to which it is an incident . It is not enough that it may be regarded by Congress as convenient or that its exercise would advance the public weal . It must be necessary and proper to the execution of the principal expressed power to which it is an incident , and without which such principal power can not be carried into effect . The whole frame of the Federal Constitution proves that the Government which it creates was intended to be one of limited and specified powers . A construction of the Constitution so broad as that by which the power in question is defended tends imperceptibly to a consolidation of power in a Government intended by its framers to be thus limited in its authority . The obvious tendency and inevitable result of a consolidation of the States into one sovereignty would be to transform the republican system of the United States into a monarchy . To guard against the assumption of all powers which encroach upon the reserved sovereignty of the States , and which consequently tend to consolidation , is the duty of all the true friends of our political system . That the power in question is not properly an incident to any of the granted powers I am fully satisfied but if there were doubts on this subject , experience has demonstrated the wisdom of the rule that all the functionaries of the Federal Government should abstain from the exercise of all questionable or doubtful powers . If an enlargement of the powers of the Federal Government should be deemed proper , it is safer and wiser to appeal to the States and the people in the mode prescribed by the Constitution for the grant desired than to assume its exercise without an amendment of the Constitution . If Congress does not possess the general power to construct works of internal improvement within the States , or to appropriate money from the Treasury for that purpose , what is there to exempt some , at least , of the objects of appropriation included in this bill from the operation of the general rule This bill assumes the existence of the power , and in some of its provisions asserts the principle that Congress may exercise it as fully as though the appropriations which it proposes were applicable to the construction of roads and canals . If there be a distinction in principle , it is not perceived , and should be clearly defined . Some of the objects of appropriation contained in this bill are local in their character , and lie within the limits of a single State and though in the language of the bill they are called harbors , they are not connected with foreign commerce , nor are they places of refuge or shelter for our Navy or commercial marine on the ocean or lake shores . To call the mouth of a creek or a shallow inlet on our coast a harbor can not confer the authority to expend the public money in its improvement . Congress have exercised the power coeval with the Constitution of establishing light houses , beacons , buoys , and piers on our ocean and lake shores for the purpose of rendering navigation safe and easy and of affording protection and shelter for our Navy and other shipping . These are safeguards placed in existing channels of navigation . After the long acquiescence of the Government through all preceding Administrations , I am not disposed to question or disturb the authority to make appropriations for such purposes . When we advance a step beyond this point , and , in addition to the establishment and support , by appropriations from the Treasury , of lighthouses , beacons , buoys , piers , and other improvements within the bays , inlets , and harbors on our ocean and lake coasts immediately connected with our foreign commerce , attempt to make improvements in the interior at points unconnected with foreign commerce , and where they are not needed for the protection and security of our Navy and commercial marine , the difficulty arises in drawing a line beyond which appropriations may not be made by the Federal Government . One of my predecessors , who saw the evil consequences of the system proposed to be revived by this bill , attempted to define this line by declaring that expenditures of this character should be confined below the ports of entry or delivery established by law . Acting on this restriction , he withheld his sanction from a bill which had passed Congress to improve the navigation of the Wabash River . He was at the same time sensible that this restriction was not as satisfactory as could be desired , and that much embarrassment may be caused to the executive department in its execution , by appropriations for remote and not well understood objects . This restriction , it was soon found , was subject to be evaded and rendered comparatively useless in checking the system of improvements which it was designed to arrest , in consequence of the facility with which ports of entry and delivery may be established by law upon the upper waters , and in some instances almost at the head springs of some of the most unimportant of our rivers , and at points on our coast possessing no commercial importance and not used as places of refuge and safety by our Navy and other shipping . Many of the ports of entry and delivery now authorized by law , so far as foreign commerce is concerned , exist only in the statute books . No entry of foreign goods is ever made and no duties are ever collected at them . No exports of American products bound for foreign countries ever clear from them . To assume that their existence in the statute book as ports of entry or delivery warrants expenditures on the waters leading to them , which would be otherwise unauthorized , would be to assert the proposition that the lawmaking power may ingraft new provisions on the Constitution . If the restriction is a sound one , it can only apply to the bays , inlets , and rivers connected with or leading to such ports as actually have foreign commerce ports at which foreign importations arrive in bulk , paying the duties charged by law , and from which exports are made to foreign countries . It will be found by applying the restriction thus understood to the bill under consideration that it contains appropriations for more than twenty objects of internal improvement , called in the bill harbors , at places which have never been declared by law either ports of entry or delivery , and at which , as appears from the records of the Treasury , there has never been an arrival of foreign merchandise , and from which there has never been a vessel cleared for a foreign country . It will be found that many of these works are new , and at places for the improvement of which appropriations are now for the first time proposed . It will be found also that the bill contains appropriations for rivers upon which there not only exists no foreign commerce , but upon which there has not been established even a paper port of entry , and for the mouths of creeks , denominated harbors , which if improved can benefit only the particular neighborhood in which they are situated . It will be found , too , to contain appropriations the expenditure of which will only have the effect of improving one place at the expense of the local natural advantages of another in its vicinity . Should this bill become a law , the same principle which authorizes the appropriations which it proposes to make would also authorize similar appropriations for the improvement of all the other bays , inlets , and creeks , which may with equal propriety be called harbors , and of all the rivers , important or unimportant , in every part of the Union . To sanction the bill with such provisions would be to concede the principle that the Federal Government possesses the power to expend the public money in a general system of internal improvements , limited in its extent only by the ever varying discretion of successive Congresses and successive Executives . It would be to efface and remove the limitations and restrictions of power which the Constitution has wisely provided to limit the authority and action of the Federal Government to a few well defined and specified objects . Besides these objections , the practical evils which must flow from the exercise on the part of the Federal Government of the powers asserted in this bill impress my mind with a grave sense of my duty to avert them from the country as far as my constitutional action may enable me to do so . It not only leads to a consolidation of power in the Federal Government at the expense of the rightful authority of the States , but its inevitable tendency is to embrace objects for the expenditure of the public money which are local in their character , benefiting but few at the expense of the common Treasury of the whole . It will engender sectional feelings and prejudices calculated to disturb the harmony of the Union . It will destroy the harmony which should prevail in our legislative councils . It will produce combinations of local and sectional interests , strong enough when united to carry propositions for appropriations of public money which could not of themselves , and standing alone , succeed , and can not fail to lead to wasteful and extravagant expenditures . It must produce a disreputable scramble for the public money , by the conflict which is inseparable from such a system between local and individual interests and the general interest of the whole . It is unjust to those States which have with their own means constructed their own internal improvements to make from the common Treasury appropriations for similar improvements in other States . In its operation it will be oppressive and unjust toward those States whose representatives and people either deny or doubt the existence of the power or think its exercise inexpedient , and who , while they equally contribute to the Treasury , can not consistently with their opinions engage in a general competition for a share of the public money . Thus a large portion of the Union , in numbers and in geographical extent , contributing its equal proportion of taxes to the support of the Government , would under the operation of such a system be compelled to see the national treasure the common stock of all unequally disbursed , and often improvidently wasted for the advantage of small sections , instead of being applied to the great national purposes in which all have a common interest , and for which alone the power to collect the revenue was given . Should the system of internal improvements proposed prevail , all these evils will multiply and increase with the increase of the number of the States and the extension of the geographical limits of the settled portions of our country . With the increase of our numbers and the extension of our settlements the local objects demanding appropriations of the public money for their improvement will be proportionately increased . In each case the expenditure of the public money would confer benefits , direct or indirect , only on a section , while these sections would become daily less in comparison with the whole . The wisdom of the framers of the Constitution in withholding power over such objects from the Federal Government and leaving them to the local governments of the States becomes more and more manifest with every year s experience of the operations of our system . In a country of limited extent , with but few such objects of expenditure if the form of government permitted it , a common treasury might be used for their improvement with much less inequality and injustice than in one of the vast extent which ours now presents in population and territory . The treasure of the world would hardly be equal to the improvement of every bay , inlet , creek , and river in our country which might be supposed to promote the agricultural , manufacturing , or commercial interests of a neighborhood . The Federal Constitution was wisely adapted in its provisions to any expansion of our limits and population , and with the advance of the confederacy of the States in the career of national greatness it becomes the more apparent that the harmony of the Union and the equal justice to which all its parts are entitled require that the Federal Government should confine its action within the limits prescribed by the Constitution to its power and authority . Some of the provisions of this bill are not subject to the objections stated , and did they stand alone I should not feel it to be my duty to withhold my approval . If no constitutional objections existed to the bill , there are others of a serious nature which deserve some consideration . It appropriates between 1 , 000 , 000 and 2 , 000 , 000 for objects which are of no pressing necessity , and this is proposed at a time when the country is engaged in a foreign war , and when Congress at its present session has authorized a loan or the issue of Treasury notes to defray the expenses of the war , to be resorted to if the exigencies of the Government shall require it . It would seem to be the dictate of wisdom under such circumstances to husband our means , and not to waste them on comparatively unimportant objects , so that we may reduce the loan or issue of Treasury notes which may become necessary to the smallest practicable sum . It would seem to be wise , too , to abstain from such expenditures with a view to avoid the accumulation of a large public debt , the existence of which would be opposed to the interests of our people as well as to the genius of our free institutions . Should this bill become a law , the principle which it establishes will inevitably lead to large and annually increasing appropriations and drains upon the Treasury , for it is not to be doubted that numerous other localities not embraced in its provisions , but quite as much entitled to the favor of the Government as those which are embraced , will demand , through their representatives in Congress , to be placed on an equal footing with them . With such an increase of expenditure must necessarily follow either an increased public debt or increased burdens upon the people by taxation to supply the Treasury with the means of meeting the accumulated demands upon it . With profound respect for the opinions of Congress , and ever anxious , as far as I can consistently with my responsibility to our common constituents , to cooperate with them in the discharge of our respective duties , it is with unfeigned regret that I find myself constrained , for the reasons which I have assigned , to withhold my approval from this bill .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Congress , by the act of the 13th of May last , declared that by the act of the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government and the United States , and for the purpose of enabling the Government of the United States to prosecute said war to a speedy and successful termination authority was vested in the President to employ the naval and military forces of the United States . It has been my unalterable purpose since the commencement of hostilities by Mexico and the declaration of the existence of war by Congress to prosecute the war in which the country was unavoidably involved with the utmost energy , with a view to its speedy and successful termination by an honorable peace . Accordingly all the operations of our naval and military forces have been directed with this view . While the sword has been held in one hand and our military movements pressed forward into the enemy s country and its coasts invested by our Navy , the tender of an honorable peace has been constantly presented to Mexico in the other . Hitherto the overtures of peace which have been made by this Government have not been accepted by Mexico . With a view to avoid a protracted war , which hesitancy and delay on our part would be so well calculated to produce , I informed you in my annual message of the 8th December last that the war would continue to be prosecuted with vigor , as the best means of securing peace , and recommended to your early and favorable consideration the measures proposed by the Secretary of War in his report accompanying that message . In my message of the 4th January last these and other measures deemed to be essential to them speedy and successful termination of the war and the attainment of a just and honorable peace were recommended to your early and favorable consideration . The worst state of things which could exist in a war with such a power as Mexico would be a course of indecision and inactivity on our part . Being charged by the Constitution and the laws with the conduct of the war , I have availed myself of all the means at my command to prosecute it with energy and vigor . The act to raise for a limited time an additional military force , and for other purposes , and which authorizes the raising of ten additional regiments to the Regular Army , to serve during the war and to be disbanded at its termination , which was presented to me on the 11th instant and approved on that day , will constitute an important part of our military force . These regiments will be raised and moved to the seat of war with the least practicable delay . It will be perceived that this act makes no provision for the organization into brigades and divisions of the increased force which it authorizes , nor for the appointment of general officers to command it . It will be proper that authority be given by law to make such organization , and to appoint , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , such number of major generals and brigadier generals as the efficiency of the service may demand . The number of officers of these grades now in service are not more than are required for their respective commands but further legislative action during your present session will , in my judgment , be required , and to which it is my duty respectfully to invite your attention . Should the war , contrary to my earnest desire , be protracted to the close of the term of service of the volunteers now in Mexico , who engaged for twelve months , an additional volunteer force will probably become necessary to supply their place . Many of the volunteers now serving in Mexico , it is not doubted , will cheerfully engage at the conclusion of their present term to serve during the war . They would constitute a more efficient force than could be speedily obtained by accepting the services of any new corps who might offer their services . They would have the advantage of the experience and discipline of a year s service , and will have become accustomed to the climate and be in less danger than new levies of suffering from the diseases of the country . I recommend , therefore , that authority be given to accept the services of such of the volunteers now in Mexico as the state of the public service may require , and who may at the termination of their present term voluntarily engage to serve during the war with Mexico , and that provision be made for commissioning the officers . Should this measure receive the favorable consideration of Congress , it is recommended that a bounty be granted to them upon their voluntarily extending their term of service . This would not only be due to these gallant men , but it would be economy to the Government , because if discharged at the end of the twelve months the Government would be bound to incur a heavy expense in bringing them back to their homes and in sending to the seat of war new corps of fresh troops to supply their place . By the act of the 13th of May last the President was authorized to accept the services of volunteers in companies , battalions , squadrons , and regiments , but no provision was made for filling up vacancies which might occur by death or discharges from the service on account of sickness or other casualties . In consequence of this omission many of the corps now in service have been much reduced in numbers . Nor was any provision made for filling vacancies of regimental or company officers who might die or resign . Information has been received at the War Department of the resignation of more than 100 of these officers . They were appointed by the State authorities , and no information has been received except in a few instances that their places have been filled and the efficiency of the service has been impaired from this cause . To remedy these defects , I recommend that authority be given to accept the services of individual volunteers to fill up the places of such as may die or become unfit for the service and be discharged , and that provision be also made for filling the places of regimental and company officers who may die or resign . By such provisions the volunteer corps may be constantly kept full or may approximate the maximum number authorized and called into service in the first instance . While it is deemed to be our true policy to prosecute the war in the manner indicated , and thus make the enemy feel its pressure and its evils , I shall be at all times ready , with the authority conferred on me by the Constitution and with all the means which may be placed at my command by Congress , to conclude a just and honorable peace . Of equal importance with an energetic and vigorous prosecution of the war are the means required to defray its expenses and to uphold and maintain the public credit . In my annual message of the 8th December last I submitted for the consideration of Congress the propriety of imposing , as a war measure , revenue duties on some of the articles now embraced in the free list . The principal articles now exempt from duty from which any considerable revenue could be derived are tea and coffee . A moderate revenue duty on these articles it is estimated would produce annually an amount exceeding 2 , 500 , 000 . Though in a period of peace , when ample means could be derived from duties on other articles for the support of the Government , it may have been deemed proper not to resort to a duty on these articles , yet when the country is engaged in a foreign war and all our resources are demanded to meet the unavoidable increased expenditure in maintaining our armies in the field no sound reason is perceived why we should not avail ourselves of the revenues which may be derived from this source . The objections which have heretofore existed to the imposition of these duties were applicable to a state of peace , when they were not needed . We are now , however , engaged in a foreign war . We need money to prosecute it and to maintain the public honor and credit . It can not be doubted that the patriotic people of the United States would cheerfully and without complaint submit to the payment of this additional duty or any other that may be necessary to maintain the honor of the country , provide for the unavoidable expenses of the Government , and to uphold the public credit . It is recommended that any duties which may be imposed on these articles be limited in their duration to the period of the war . An additional annual revenue , it is estimated , of between half a million and a million of dollars would be derived from the graduation and reduction of the price of such of the public lands as have been long offered in the market at the minimum price established by the existing laws and have remained unsold . And in addition to other reasons commending the measure to favorable consideration , it is recommended as a financial measure . The duty suggested on tea and coffee and the graduation and reduction of the price of the public lands would secure an additional annual revenue to the Treasury of not less than 3 , 000 , 000 , and would thereby prevent the necessity of incurring a public debt annually to that amount , the interest on which must be paid semiannually , and ultimately the debt itself by a tax on the people . It is a sound policy and one which has long been approved by the Government and people of the United States never to resort to loans unless in cases of great public emergency , and then only for the smallest amount which the public necessities will permit . The increased revenues which the measures now recommended would produce would , moreover , enable the Government to negotiate a loan for any additional sum which may be found to be needed with more facility and at cheaper rates than can be done without them . Under the injunction of the Constitution which makes it my duty from time to time to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and to recommend to their consideration such measures as shall be judged necessary and expedient , I respectfully and earnestly invite the action of Congress on the measures herein presented for their consideration . The public good , as well as a sense of my responsibility to our common constituents , in my judgment imperiously demands that I should present them for your enlightened consideration and invoke favorable action upon them before the close of your present session .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives In resuming your labors in the service of the people it is a subject of congratulation that there has been no period in our past history when all the elements of national prosperity have been so fully developed . Since your last session no afflicting dispensation has visited our country . General good health has prevailed , abundance has crowned the toil of the husbandman , and labor in all its branches is receiving an ample reward , while education , science , and the arts are rapidly enlarging the means of social happiness . The progress of our country in her career of greatness , not only in the vast extension of our territorial limits and the rapid increase of our population , but in resources and wealth and in the happy condition of our people , is without an example in the history of nations . As the wisdom , strength , and beneficence of our free institutions are unfolded , every day adds fresh motives to contentment and fresh incentives to patriotism . Our devout and sincere acknowledgments are due to the gracious Giver of All Good for the numberless blessings which our beloved country enjoys . It is a source of high satisfaction to know that the relations of the United States with all other nations , with a single exception , are of the most amicable character . Sincerely attached to the policy of peace early adopted and steadily pursued by this Government , I have anxiously desired to cultivate and cherish friendship and commerce with every foreign power . The spirit and habits of the American people are favorable to the maintenance of such international harmony . In adhering to this wise policy , a preliminary and paramount duty obviously consists in the protection of our national interests from encroachment or sacrifice and our national honor from reproach . These must be maintained at any hazard . They admit of no compromise or neglect , and must be scrupulously and constantly guarded . In their vigilant vindication collision and conflict with foreign powers may sometimes become unavoidable . Such has been our scrupulous adherence to the dictates of justice in all our foreign intercourse that , though steadily and rapidly advancing in prosperity and power , we have given no just cause of complaint to any nation and have enjoyed the blessings of peace for more than thirty years . From a policy so sacred to humanity and so salutary in its effects upon our political system we should never be induced voluntarily to depart . The existing war with Mexico was neither desired nor provoked by the United States . On the contrary , all honorable means were resorted to avert it . After years of endurance of aggravated and unredressed wrongs on our part , Mexico , in violation of solemn treaty stipulations and of every principle of justice recognized by civilized nations , commenced hostilities , and thus by her own act forced the war upon us . Long before the advance of our Army to the left bank of the Rio Grande we had ample cause of war against Mexico , and had the United States resorted to this extremity we might have appealed to the whole civilized world for the justice of our cause . I deem it to be my duty to present to you on the present occasion a condensed review of the injuries we had sustained , of the causes which led to the war , and of its progress since its commencement . This is rendered the more necessary because of the misapprehensions which have to some extent prevailed as to its origin and true character . The war has been represented as unjust and unnecessary and as one of aggression on our part upon a weak and injured enemy . Such erroneous views , though entertained by but few , have been widely and extensively circulated , not only at home , but have been spread throughout Mexico and the whole world . A more effectual means could not have been devised to encourage the enemy and protract the war than to advocate and adhere to their cause , and thus give them aid and comfort . It is a source of national pride and exultation that the great body of our people have thrown no such obstacles in the way of the Government in prosecuting the war successfully , but have shown themselves to be eminently patriotic and ready to vindicate their country s honor and interests at any sacrifice . The alacrity and promptness with which our volunteer forces rushed to the field on their country s call prove not only their patriotism , but their deep conviction that our cause is just . The wrongs which we have suffered from Mexico almost ever since she became an independent power and the patient endurance with which we have borne them are without a parallel in the history of modern civilized nations . There is reason to believe that if these wrongs had been resented and resisted in the first instance the present war might have been avoided . One outrage , however , permitted to pass with impunity almost necessarily encouraged the perpetration of another , until at last Mexico seemed to attribute to weakness and indecision on our part a forbearance which was the offspring of magnanimity and of a sincere desire to preserve friendly relations with a sister republic . Scarcely had Mexico achieved her independence , which the United States were the first among the nations to acknowledge , when she commenced the system of insult and spoliation which she has ever since pursued . Our citizens engaged in lawful commerce were imprisoned , their vessels seized , and our flag insulted in her ports . If money was wanted , the lawless seizure and confiscation of our merchant vessels and their cargoes was a ready resource , and if to accomplish their purposes it became necessary to imprison the owners , captains , and crews , it was done . Rulers superseded rulers in Mexico in rapid succession , but still there was no change in this system of depredation . The Government of the United States made repeated reclamations on behalf of its citizens , but these were answered by the perpetration of new outrages . Promises of redress made by Mexico in the most solemn forms were postponed or evaded . The files and records of the Department of State contain conclusive proofs of numerous lawless acts perpetrated upon the property and persons of our citizens by Mexico , and of wanton insults to our national flag . The interposition of our Government to obtain redress was again and again invoked under circumstances which no nation ought to disregard . It was hoped that these outrages would cease and that Mexico would be restrained by the laws which regulate the conduct of civilized nations in their intercourse with each other after the treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation of the 5th of April , 1831 , was concluded between the two Republics but this hope soon proved to be vain . The course of seizure and confiscation of the property of our citizens , the violation of their persons , and the insults to our flag pursued by Mexico previous to that time were scarcely suspended for even a brief period , although the treaty so clearly defines the rights and duties of the respective parties that it is impossible to misunderstand or mistake them . In less than seven years after the conclusion of that treaty our grievances had become so intolerable that in the opinion of President Jackson they should no longer be endured . In his message to Congress in February , 1837 , he presented them to the consideration of that body , and declared that The length of time since some of the injuries have been committed , the repeated and unavailing applications for redress , the wanton character of some of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens , upon the officers and flag of the United States , independent of recent insults to this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican minister , would justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war . In a spirit of kindness and forbearance , however , he recommended reprisals as a milder mode of redress . He declared that war should not be used as a remedy by just and generous nations , confiding in their strength for injuries committed , if it can be honorably avoided , and added It has occurred to me that , considering the present embarrassed condition of that country , we should act with both wisdom and moderation by giving to Mexico one more opportunity to atone for the past before we take redress into our Own hands . To avoid all misconception on the part of Mexico , as well as to protect our own national character from reproach , this opportunity should be given with the avowed design and full preparation to take immediate satisfaction if it should not be obtained on a repetition of the demand for it . To this end I recommend that an act be passed authorizing reprisals , and the use of the naval force of the United States by the Executive against Mexico to enforce them , in the event of a refusal by the Mexican Government to come to an amicable adjustment of the matters in controversy between us upon another demand thereof made from on board out of our vessels of war on the coast of Mexico . Committees of both Houses of Congress , to which this message of the President was referred , fully sustained his views of the character of the wrongs which we had suffered from Mexico , and recommended that another demand for redress should be made before authorizing war or reprisals . The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate , in their report , say After such a demand , should prompt justice be refused by the Mexican Government , we may appeal to all nations , not only for the equity and moderation with which we shall have acted toward a sister republic , but for the necessity which will then compel us to seek redress for our wrongs , either by actual war or by reprisals . The subject will then be presented before Congress , at the commencement of the next session , in a clear and distinct form , and the committee can not doubt but that such measures will be immediately adopted as may be necessary to vindicate the honor of the country and insure ample reparation to our injured fellow citizens . The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives made a similar recommendation . In their report they say that They fully concur with the President that ample cause exists for taking redress into our own hands , and believe that we should be justified in the opinion of other nations for taking such a step . But they are willing to try the experiment of another demand , made in the most solemn form , upon the justice of the Mexican Government before any further proceedings are adopted . No difference of opinion upon the subject is believed to have existed in Congress at that time the executive and legislative departments concurred and yet such has been our forbearance and desire to preserve peace with Mexico that the wrongs of which we then complained , and which gave rise to these solemn proceedings , not only remain unredressed to this day , but additional causes of complaint of an aggravated character have ever since been accumulating . Shortly after these proceedings a special messenger was dispatched to Mexico to make a final demand for redress , and on the 20th of July , 1837 , the demand was made . The reply of the Mexican Government bears date on the 29th of the same month , and contains assurances of the anxious wish of the Mexican Government not to delay the moment of that final and equitable adjustment which is to terminate the existing difficulties between the two Governments that nothing should be left undone which may contribute to the most speedy and equitable determination of the subjects which have so seriously engaged the attention of the American Government that the Mexican Government would adopt as the only guides for its conduct the plainest principles of public right , the sacred obligations imposed by international law , and the religious faith of treaties , and that whatever reason and justice may dictate respecting each case will be done . The assurance was further given that the decision of the Mexican Government upon each cause of complaint for which redress had been demanded should be communicated to the Government of the United States by the Mexican minister at Washington . These solemn assurances in answer to our demand for redress were disregarded . By making them , however , Mexico obtained further delay . President Van Buren , in his annual message to Congress of the 5th of December , 1837 , states that although the larger number of our demands for redress , and many of them aggravated cases of personal wrongs , have been now for years before the Mexican Government , and some of the causes of national complaint , and those of the most offensive character , admitted of immediate , simple , and satisfactory replies , it is only within a few days past that any specific communication in answer to our last demand , made five months ago , has been received from the Mexican minister and that for not one of our public complaints has satisfaction been given or offered , that but one of the cases of personal wrong has been favorably considered , and that but four cases of both descriptions out of all those formally presented and earnestly pressed have as yet been decided upon by the Mexican Government . President Van Buren , believing that it would be vain to make any further attempt to obtain redress by the ordinary means within the power of the Executive , communicated this opinion to Congress in the message referred to , in which he said On a careful and deliberate examination of their contents of the correspondence with the Mexican Government , and considering the spirit manifested by the Mexican Government , it has become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stands to Congress , to whom it belongs to decide upon the time , the mode , and the measure of redress . Had the United States at that time adopted compulsory measures and taken redress into their own hands , all our difficulties with Mexico would probably have been long since adjusted and the existing war have been averted . Magnanimity and moderation on our part only had the effect to complicate these difficulties and render an amicable settlement of them the more embarrassing . That such measures of redress under similar provocations committed by any of the powerful nations of Europe would have been promptly resorted to by the United States can not be doubted . The national honor and the preservation of the national character throughout the world , as well as our own self respect and the protection due to our own citizens , would have rendered such a resort indispensable . The history of no civilized nation in modern times has presented within so brief a period so many wanton attacks upon the honor of its flag and upon the property and persons of its citizens as had at that time been borne by the United States from the Mexican authorities and people . But Mexico was a sister republic on the North American continent , occupying a territory contiguous to our own , and was in a feeble and distracted condition , and these considerations , it is presumed , induced Congress to forbear still longer . Instead of taking redress into our own hands , a new negotiation was entered upon with fair promises on the part of Mexico , but with the real purpose , as the event has proved , of indefinitely postponing the reparation which we demanded , and which was so justly due . This negotiation , after more than a year s delay , resulted in the convention of the 11th of April , 1839 , for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United States of America upon the Government of the Mexican Republic . The joint board of commissioners created by this convention to examine and decide upon these claims was not organized until the month of August , 1840 , and under the terms of the convention they were to terminate their duties within eighteen months from that time . Four of the eighteen months were consumed in preliminary discussions on frivolous and dilatory points raised by the Mexican commissioners , and it was not until the month of December , 1840 , that they commenced the examination of the claims of our citizens upon Mexico . Fourteen months only remained to examine and decide upon these numerous and complicated cases . In the month of February , 1842 , the term of the commission expired , leaving many claims undisposed of for want of time . The claims which were allowed by the board and by the umpire authorized by the convention to decide in case of disagreement between the Mexican and American commissioners amounted to 2 , 026 , 139 . 68 . There were pending before the umpire when the commission expired additional claims , which had been examined and awarded by the American commissioners and had not been allowed by the Mexican commissioners , amounting to 928 , 627 . 88 , upon which he did not decide , alleging that his authority had ceased with the termination of the joint commission . Besides these claims , there were others of American citizens amounting to 3 , 336 , 837 . 05 , which had been submitted to the board , and upon which they had not time to decide before their final adjournment . The sum of 2 , 026 , 139 . 68 , which had been awarded to the claimants , was a liquidated and ascertained debt due by Mexico , about which there could be no dispute , and which she was bound to pay according to the terms of the convention . Soon after the final awards for this amount had been made the Mexican Government asked for a postponement of the time of making payment , alleging that it would be inconvenient to make the payment at the time stipulated . In the spirit of forbearing kindness toward a sister republic , which Mexico has so long abused , the United States promptly complied with her request . A second convention was accordingly concluded between the two Governments on the 30th of January , 1843 , which upon its face declares that this new arrangement is entered into for the accommodation of Mexico . By the terms of this convention all the interest due on the awards which had been made in favor of the claimants under the convention of the 11th of April , 1839 , was to be paid to them on the 30th of April , 1843 , and the principal of the said awards and the interest accruing thereon was stipulated to be paid in five years , in equal installments every three months . Notwithstanding this new convention was entered into at the request of Mexico and for the purpose of relieving her from embarrassment , the claimants have only received the interest due on the 30th of April , 1843 , and three of the twenty installments . Although the payment of the sum thus liquidated and confessedly due by Mexico to our citizens as indemnity for acknowledged acts of outrage and wrong was secured by treaty , the obligations of which are ever held sacred by all just nations , yet Mexico has violated this solemn engagement by failing and refusing to make the payment . The two installments due in April and July , 1844 , under the peculiar circumstances connected with them , have been assumed by the United States and discharged to the claimants , but they are still due by Mexico . But this is not all of which we have just cause of complaint . To provide a remedy for the claimants whose cases were not decided by the joint commission under the convention of April 11 , 1839 , it was expressly stipulated by the sixth article of the convention of the 30th of January , 1843 , that A new convention shall be entered into for the settlement of all claims of the Government and citizens of the United States against the Republic of Mexico which were not finally decided by the late commission which met in the city of Washington , and of all claims of the Government and citizens of Mexico against the United States . In conformity with this stipulation , a third convention was concluded and signed at the city of Mexico on the 20th of November , 1843 , by the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments , by which provision was made for ascertaining and paying these claims . In January , 1844 , this convention was ratified by the Senate of the United States with two amendments , which were manifestly reasonable in their character . Upon a reference of the amendments proposed to the Government of Mexico , the same evasions , difficulties , and delays were interposed which have so long marked the policy of that Government toward the United States . It has not even yet decided whether it would or would not accede to them , although the subject has been repeatedly pressed upon its consideration . Mexico has thus violated a second time the faith of treaties by failing or refusing to carry into effect the sixth article of the convention of January , 1843 . Such is the history of the wrongs which we have suffered and patiently endured from Mexico through a long series of years . So far from affording reasonable satisfaction for the injuries and insults we had borne , a great aggravation of them consists in the fact that while the United States , anxious to preserve a good understanding with Mexico , have been constantly but vainly employed in seeking redress for past wrongs , new outrages were constantly occurring , which have continued to increase our causes of complaint and to swell the amount of our demands . While the citizens of the United States were conducting a lawful commerce with Mexico under the guaranty of a treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation , many of them have suffered all the injuries which would have resulted from open war . This treaty , instead of affording protection to our citizens , has been the means of inviting them into the ports of Mexico that they might be , as they have been in numerous instances , plundered of their property and deprived of their personal liberty if they dared insist on their rights . Had the unlawful seizures of American property and the violation of the personal liberty of our citizens , to say nothing of the insults to our flag , which have occurred in the ports of Mexico taken place on the high seas , they would themselves long since have constituted a state of actual war between the two countries . In so long suffering Mexico to violate her most solemn treaty obligations , plunder our citizens of their property , and imprison their persons without affording them any redress we have failed to perform one of the first and highest duties which every government owes to its citizens , and the consequence has been that many of them have been reduced from a state of affluence to bankruptcy . The proud name of American citizen , which ought to protect all who bear it from insult and injury throughout the world , has afforded no such protection to our citizens in Mexico . We had ample cause of war against Mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities but even then we forbore to take redress into our own hands until Mexico herself became the aggressor by invading our soil in hostile array and shedding the blood of our citizens . Such are the grave causes of complaint on the part of the United States against Mexico causes which existed long before the annexation of Texas to the American Union and yet , animated by the love of peace and a magnanimous moderation , we did not adopt those measures of redress which under such circumstances are the justified resort of injured nations . The annexation of Texas to the United States constituted no just cause of offense to Mexico . The pretext that it did so is wholly inconsistent and irreconcilable with well authenticated facts connected with the revolution by which Texas became independent of Mexico . That this may be the more manifest , it may be proper to advert to the causes and to the history of the principal events of that revolution . Texas constituted a portion of the ancient Province of Louisiana , ceded to the United States by France in the year 1803 . In the year 1819 the United States , by the Florida treaty , ceded to Spain all that part of Louisiana within the present limits of Texas , and Mexico , by the revolution which separated her from Spain and rendered her an independent nation , succeeded to the rights of the mother country over this territory . In the year 1824 Mexico established a federal constitution , under which the Mexican Republic was composed of a number of sovereign States confederated together in a federal union similar to our own . Each of these States had its own executive , legislature , and judiciary , and for all except federal purposes was as independent of the General Government and that of the other States as is Pennsylvania or Virginia under our Constitution . Texas and Coahuila united and formed one of these Mexican States . The State constitution which they adopted , and which was approved by the Mexican Confederacy , asserted that they were free and independent of the other Mexican United States and of every other power and dominion whatsoever , and proclaimed the great principle of human liberty that the sovereignty of the state resides originally and essentially in the general mass of the individuals who compose it . To the Government under this constitution , as well as to that under the federal constitution , the people of Texas owed allegiance . Emigrants from foreign countries , including the United States , were invited by the colonization laws of the State and of the Federal Government to settle in Texas . Advantageous terms were offered to induce them to leave their own country and become Mexican citizens . This invitation was accepted by many of our citizens in the full faith that in their new home they would be governed by laws enacted by representatives elected by themselves , and that their lives , liberty , and property would be protected by constitutional guaranties similar to those which existed in the Republic they had left . Under a Government thus organized they continued until the year 1835 , when a military revolution broke out in the City of Mexico which entirely subverted the federal and State constitutions and placed a military dictator at the head of the Government . By a sweeping decree of a Congress subservient to the will of the Dictator the several State constitutions were abolished and the States themselves converted into mere departments of the central Government . The people of Texas were unwilling to submit to this usurpation . Resistance to such tyranny became a high duty . Texas was fully absolved from all allegiance to the central Government of Mexico from the moment that Government had abolished her State constitution and in its place substituted an arbitrary and despotic central government . Such were the principal causes of the Texan revolution . The people of Texas at once determined upon resistance and flew to arms . In the midst of these important and exciting events , however , they did not omit to place their liberties upon a secure and permanent foundation . They elected members to a convention , who in the month of March , 1836 , issued a formal declaration that their political connection with the Mexican nation has forever ended , and that the people of Texas do now constitute a free , sovereign , and independent Republic , and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to independent nations . They also adopted for their government a liberal republican constitution . About the same time Santa Anna , then the Dictator of Mexico , invaded Texas with a numerous army for the purpose of subduing her people and enforcing obedience to his arbitrary and despotic Government . On the 21st of April , 1836 , he was met by the Texan citizen soldiers , and on that day was achieved by them the memorable victory of San Jacinto , by which they conquered their independence . Considering the numbers engaged on the respective sides , history does not record a more brilliant achievement . Santa Anna himself was among the captives . In the month of May , 1836 , Santa Anna acknowledged by a treaty with the Texan authorities in the most solumn form the full , entire , and perfect independence of the Republic of Texas . It is true he was then a prisoner of war , but it is equally true that he had failed to reconquer Texas , and had met with signal defeat that his authority had not been revoked , and that by virtue of this treaty he obtained his personal release . By it hostilities were suspended , and the army which had invaded Texas under his command returned in pursuance of this arrangement unmolested to Mexico . From the day that the battle of San Jacinto was fought until the present hour Mexico has never possessed the power to reconquer Texas . In the language of the Secretary of State of the United States in a dispatch to our minister in Mexico under date of the 8th of July , 1842 Mexico may have chosen to consider , and may still choose to consider , Texas as having been at all times since 1835 , and as still continuing , a rebellious province but the world has been obliged to take a very different view of the matter . From the time of the battle of San Jacinto , in April , 1836 , to the present moment , Texas has exhibited the same external signs of national independence as Mexico herself , and with quite as much stability of government . Practically free and independent , acknowledged as a political sovereignty by the principal powers of the world , no hostile foot finding rest within her territory for six or seven years , and Mexico herself refraining for all that period from any further attempt to reestablish her own authority over that territory , it can not but be surprising to find De Bocanegra the secretary of foreign affairs of Mexico complaining that for that whole period citizens of the United States or its Government have been favoring the rebels of Texas and supplying them with vessels , ammunition , and money , as if the war for the reduction of the Province of Texas had been constantly prosecuted by Mexico , and her success prevented by these influences from abroad . In the same dispatch the Secretary of State affirms that Since 1837 the United States have regarded Texas as an independent sovereignty as much as Mexico , and that trade and commerce with citizens of a government at war with Mexico can not on that account be regarded as an intercourse by which assistance and succor are given to Mexican rebels . The whole current of De Bocanegra s remarks runs in the same direction , as if the independence of Texas had not been acknowledged . It has been acknowledged it was acknowledged in 1837 against the remonstrance and protest of Mexico , and most of the acts of any importance of which De Bocanegra complains flow necessarily from that recognition . He speaks of Texas as still being an integral part of the territory of the Mexican Republic , but he can not but understand that the United States do not so regard it . The real complaint of Mexico , therefore , is in substance neither more nor less than a complaint against the recognition of Texan independence . It may be thought rather late to repeat that complaint , and not quite just to confine it to the United States to the exemption of England , France , and Belgium , unless the United States , having been the first to acknowledge the independence of Mexico herself , are to be blamed for setting an example for the recognition of that of Texas . And he added that The Constitution , public treaties , and the laws oblige the President to regard Texas as an independent state , and its territory as no part of the territory of Mexico . Texas had been an independent state , with an organized government , defying the power of Mexico to overthrow or reconquer her , for more than ten years before Mexico commenced the present war against the United States . Texas had given such evidence to the world of her ability to maintain her separate existence as an independent nation that she had been formally recognized as such not only by the United States , but by several of the principal powers of Europe . These powers had entered into treaties of amity , commerce , and navigation with her . They had received and accredited her ministers and other diplomatic agents at their respective courts , and they had commissioned ministers and diplomatic agents on their part to the Government of Texas . If Mexico , notwithstanding all this and her utter inability to subdue or reconquer Texas , still stubbornly refused to recognize her as an independent nation , she was none the less so on that account . Mexico herself had been recognized as an independent nation by the United States and by other powers many years before Spain , of which before her revolution she had been a colony , would agree to recognize her as such and yet Mexico was at that time in the estimation of the civilized world , and in fact , none the less an independent power because Spain still claimed her as a colony . If Spain had continued until the present period to assert that Mexico was one of her colonies in rebellion against her , this would not have made her so or changed the fact of her independent existence . Texas at the period of her annexation to the United States bore the same relation to Mexico that Mexico had borne to Spain for many years before Spain acknowledged her independence , with this important difference , that before the annexation of Texas to the United States was consummated Mexico herself , by a formal act of her Government , had acknowledged the independence of Texas as a nation . It is true that in the act of recognition she prescribed a condition which she had no power or authority to impose that Texas should not annex herself to any other power but this could not detract in any degree from the recognition which Mexico then made of her actual independence . Upon this plain statement of facts , it is absurd for Mexico to allege as a pretext for commencing hostilities against the United States that Texas is still a part of her territory . But there are those who , conceding all this to be true , assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces instead of the Rio Grande , and that therefore in marching our Army to the east bank of the latter river we passed the Texan line and invaded the territory of Mexico . A simple statement of facts known to exist will conclusively refute such an assumption . Texas , as ceded to the United States by France in 1803 , has been always claimed as extending west to the Rio Grande or Rio Bravo . This fact is established by the authority of our most eminent statesmen at a period when the question was as well , if not better , understood than it is at present . During Jefferson s Administration Monroe and Pinckney , who had been sent on a special mission to Madrid , charged among other things with the adjustment of boundary between the two countries , in a note addressed to the Spanish minister of foreign affairs under date of the 28th of January , 1805 , assert that the boundaries of Louisiana , as ceded to the United States by France , are the river Perdido on the east and the river Bravo on the west , and they add that the facts and principles which justify this conclusion are so satisfactory to our Government as to convince it that the United States have not a better right to the island of New Orleans under the cession referred to than they have to the whole district of territory which is above described . Down to the conclusion of the Florida treaty , in February , 1819 , by which this territory was ceded to Spain , the United States asserted and maintained their territorial rights to this extent . In the month of June , 1818 , during Monroe s Administration , information having been received that a number of foreign adventurers had landed at Galveston with the avowed purpose of forming a settlement in that vicinity , a special messenger was dispatched by the Government of the United States with instructions from the Secretary of State to warn them to desist , should they be found there , or any other place north of the Rio Bravo , and within the territory claimed by the United States . He was instructed , should they be found in the country north of that river , to make known to them the surprise with which the President has seen possession thus taken , without authority from the United States , of a place within their territorial limits , and upon which no lawful settlement can be made without their sanction . He was instructed to call upon them to avow under what national authority they profess to act , and to give them due warning that the place is within the United States , who will suffer no permanent settlement to be made there under any authority other than their own . As late as the 8th of July , 1842 , the Secretary of State of the United States , in a note addressed to our minister in Mexico , maintains that by the Florida treaty of 1819 the territory as far west as the Rio Grande was confirmed to Spain . In that note he states that By the treaty of the 22d of February , 1819 , between the United States and Spain , the Sabine was adopted as the line of boundary between the two powers . Up to that period no considerable colonization had been effected in Texas but the territory between the Sabine and the Rio Grande being confirmed to Spain by the treaty , applications were made to that power for grants of land , and such grants or permissions of settlement were in fact made by the Spanish authorities in favor of citizens of the United States proposing to emigrate to Texas in numerous families before the declaration of independence by Mexico . The Texas which was ceded to Spain by the Florida treaty of 1819 embraced all the country now claimed by the State of Texas between the Nueces and the Rio Grande . The Republic of Texas always claimed this river as her western boundary , and in her treaty made with Santa Anna in May , 1836 , he recognized it as such . By the constitution which Texas adopted in March , 1836 , senatorial and representative districts were organized extending west of the Nueces . The Congress of Texas on the 19th of December , 1836 , passed An act to define the boundaries of the Republic of Texas , in which they declared the Rio Grande from its mouth to its source to be their boundary , and by the said act they extended their civil and political jurisdiction over the country up to that boundary . During a period of more than nine years which intervened between the adoption of her constitution and her annexation as one of the States of our Union Texas asserted and exercised many acts of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants west of the Nueces . She organized and defined the limits of counties extending to the Rio Grande she established courts of justice and extended her judicial system over the territory she established a custom house and collected duties , and also post offices and post roads , in it she established a land office and issued numerous grants for land within its limits a senator and a representative residing in it were elected to the Congress of the Republic and served as such before the act of annexation took place . In both the Congress and convention of Texas which gave their assent to the terms of annexation to the United States proposed by our Congress were representatives residing west of the Nueces , who took part in the act of annexation itself . This was the Texas which by the act of our Congress of the 29th of December , 1845 , was admitted as one of the States of our Union . That the Congress of the United States understood the State of Texas which they admitted into the Union to extend beyond the Nueces is apparent from the fact that on the 31st of December , 1845 , only two days after the act of admission , they passed a law to establish a collection district in the State of Texas , by which they created a port of delivery at Corpus Christi , situated west of the Nueces , and being the same point at which the Texas custom house under the laws of that Republic had been located , and directed that a surveyor to collect the revenue should be appointed for that port by the President , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . A surveyor was accordingly nominated , and confirmed by the Senate , and has been ever since in the performance of his duties . All these acts of the Republic of Texas and of our Congress preceded the orders for the advance of our Army to the east bank of the Rio Grande . Subsequently Congress passed an act establishing certain post routes extending west of the Nueces . The country west of that river now constitutes a part of one of the Congressional districts of Texas and is represented in the House of Representatives . The Senators from that State were chosen by a legislature in which the country west of that river was represented . In view of all these facts it is difficult to conceive upon what ground it can be maintained that in occupying the country west of the Nueces with our Army , with a view solely to its security and defense , we invaded the territory of Mexico . But it would have been still more difficult to justify the Executive , whose duty it is to see that the laws be faithfully executed , if in the face of all these proceedings , both of the Congress of Texas and of the United States , he had assumed the responsibility of yielding up the territory west of the Nueces to Mexico or of refusing to protect and defend this territory and its inhabitants , including Corpus Christi as well as the remainder of Texas , against the threatened Mexican invasion . But Mexico herself has never placed the war which she has waged upon the ground that our Army occupied the intermediate territory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande . Her refuted pretension that Texas was not in fact an independent state , but a rebellious province , was obstinately persevered in , and her avowed purpose in commencing a war with the United States was to reconquer Texas and to restore Mexican authority over the whole territory not to the Nueces only , but to the Sabine . In view of the proclaimed menaces of Mexico to this effect , I deemed it my duty , as a measure of precaution and defense , to order our Army to occupy a position on our frontier as a military post , from which our troops could best resist and repel any attempted invasion which Mexico might make . Our Army had occupied a position at Corpus Christi , west of the Nueces , as early as August , 1845 , without complaint from any quarter . Had the Nueces been regarded as the true western boundary of Texas , that boundary had been passed by our Army many months before it advanced to the eastern bank of the Rio Grande . In my annual message of December last I informed Congress that upon the invitation of both the Congress and convention of Texas I had deemed it proper to order a strong squadron to the coasts of Mexico and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of Texas to protect and defend the inhabitants against the menaced invasion of Mexico . In that message I informed Congress that the moment the terms of annexation offered by the United States were accepted by Texas the latter became so far a part of our own country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defense , and that for that purpose our squadron had been ordered to the Gulf and our Army to take a position between the Nueces and the Del Norte or Rio Grande and to repel any invasion of the Texan territory which might be attempted by the Mexican forces . It was deemed proper to issue this order , because soon after the President of Texas , in April , 1845 , had issued his proclamation convening the Congress of that Republic for the purpose of submitting to that body the terms of annexation proposed by the United States the Government of Mexico made serious threats of invading the Texan territory . These threats became more imposing as it became more apparent in the progress of the question that the people of Texas would decide in favor of accepting the terms of annexation , and finally they had assumed such a formidable character as induced both the Congress and convention of Texas to request that a military force should be sent by the United States into her territory for the purpose of protecting and defending her against the threatened invasion . It would have been a violation of good faith toward the people of Texas to have refused to afford the aid which they desired against a threatened invasion to which they had been exposed by their free determination to annex themselves to our Union in compliance with the overture made to them by the joint resolution of our Congress . Accordingly , a portion of the Army was ordered to advance into Texas . Corpus Christi was the position selected by General Taylor . He encamped at that place in August , 1845 , and the Army remained in that position until the 11th of March , 1846 , when it moved westward , and on the 28th of that month reached the east bank of the Rio Grande opposite to Matamoras . This movement was made in pursuance of orders from the War Department , issued on the 13th of January , 1846 . Before these orders were issued the dispatch of our minister in Mexico transmitting the decision of the council of government of Mexico advising that he should not be received , and also the dispatch of our consul residing in the City of Mexico , the former bearing date on the 17th and the latter on the 18th of December , 1845 , copies of both of which accompanied my message to Congress of the 11th of May last , were received at the Department of State . These communications rendered it highly probable , if not absolutely certain , that our minister would not be received by the Government of General Herrera . It was also well known that but little hope could be entertained of a different result from General Paredes in case the revolutionary movement which he was prosecuting should prove successful , as was highly probable . The partisans of Paredes , as our minister in the dispatch referred to states , breathed the fiercest hostility against the United States , denounced the proposed negotiation as treason , and openly called upon the troops and the people to put down the Government of Herrera by force . The reconquest of Texas and war with the United States were openly threatened . These were the circumstances existing when it was deemed proper to order the Army under the command of General Taylor to advance to the western frontier of Texas and occupy a position on or near the Rio Grande . The apprehensions of a contemplated Mexican invasion have been since fully justified by the event . The determination of Mexico to rush into hostilities with the United States was afterwards manifested from the whole tenor of the note of the Mexican minister of foreign affairs to our minister bearing date on the 12th of March , 1846 . Paredes had then revolutionized the Government , and his minister , after referring to the resolution for the annexation of Texas which had been adopted by our Congress in March , 1845 , proceeds to declare that A fact such as this , or , to speak with greater exactness , so notable an act of usurpation , created an imperious necessity that Mexico , for her own honor , should repel it with proper firmness and dignity . The supreme Government had beforehand declared that it would look upon such an act as a casus belli , and as a consequence of this declaration negotiation was by its very nature at an end , and war was the only recourse of the Mexican Government . It appears also that on the 4th of April following General Paredes , through his minister of war , issued orders to the Mexican general in command on the Texan frontier to attack our Army by every means which war permits . To this General Paredes had been pledged to the army and people of Mexico during the military revolution which had brought him into power . On the 18th of April , 1846 , General Paredes addressed a letter to the commander on that frontier in which he stated to him At the present date I suppose you , at the head of that valiant army , either fighting already or preparing for the operations of a campaign and , Supposing you already on the theater of operations and with all the forces assembled , it is indispensable that hostilities be commenced , yourself taking the initiative against the enemy . The movement of our Army to the Rio Grande was made by the commanding general under positive orders to abstain from all aggressive acts toward Mexico or Mexican citizens , and to regard the relations between the two countries as peaceful unless Mexico should declare war or commit acts of hostility indicative of a state of war , and these orders he faithfully executed . Whilst occupying his position on the east bank of the Rio Grande , within the limits of Texas , then recently admitted as one of the States of our Union , the commanding general of the Mexican forces , who , in pursuance of the orders of his Government , had collected a large army on the opposite shore of the Rio Grande , crossed the river , invaded our territory , and commenced hostilities by attacking our forces . Thus , after all the injuries which we had received and borne from Mexico , and after she had insultingly rejected a minister sent to her on a mission of peace , and whom she had solemnly agreed to receive , she consummated her long course of outrage against our country by commencing an offensive war and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil . The United States never attempted to acquire Texas by conquest . On the contrary , at an early period after the people of Texas had achieved their independence they sought to be annexed to the United States . At a general election in September , 1836 , they decided with great unanimity in favor of annexation , and in November following the Congress of the Republic authorized the appointment of a minister to bear their request to this Government . This Government , however , having remained neutral between Texas and Mexico during the war between them , and considering it due to the honor of our country and our fair fame among the nations of the earth that we should not at this early period consent to annexation , nor until it should be manifest to the whole world that the reconquest of Texas by Mexico was impossible , refused to accede to the overtures made by Texas . On the 12th of April , 1844 , after more than seven years had elapsed since Texas had established her independence , a treaty was concluded for the annexation of that Republic to the United States , which was rejected by the Senate . Finally , on the 1st of March , 1845 , Congress passed a joint resolution for annexing her to the United States upon certain preliminary conditions to which her assent was required . The solemnities which characterized the deliberations and conduct of the Government and people of Texas on the deeply interesting questions presented by these resolutions are known to the world . The Congress , the Executive , and the people of Texas , in a convention elected for that purpose , accepted with great unanimity the proposed terms of annexation , and thus consummated on her part the great act of restoring to our Federal Union a vast territory which had been ceded to Spain by the Florida treaty more than a quarter of a century before . After the joint resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United States had been passed by our Congress the Mexican minister at Washington addressed a note to the Secretary of State , bearing date on the 6th of March , 1845 , protesting against it as an act of aggression the most unjust which can be found recorded in the annals of modern history , namely , that of despoiling a friendly nation like Mexico of a considerable portion of her territory , and protesting against the resolution of annexation as being an act whereby the Province of Texas , an integral portion of the Mexican territory , is agreed and admitted into the American Union and he announced that as a consequence his mission to the United States had terminated , and demanded his passports , which were granted . It was upon the absurd pretext , made by Mexico herself indebted for her independence to a successful revolution , that the Republic of Texas still continued to be , notwithstanding all that had passed , a Province of Mexico that this step was taken by the Mexican minister . Every honorable effort has been used by me to avoid the war which followed , but all have proved vain . All our attempts to preserve peace have been met by insult and resistance on the part of Mexico . My efforts to this end commenced in the note of the Secretary of State of the 10th of March , 1845 , in answer to that of the Mexican minister . Whilst declining to reopen a discussion which had already been exhausted , and proving again what was known to the whole world , that Texas had long since achieved her independence , the Secretary of State expressed the regret of this Government that Mexico should have taken offense at the resolution of annexation passed by Congress , and gave assurance that our most strenuous efforts shall be devoted to the amicable adjustment of every cause of complaint between the two Governments and to the cultivation of the kindest and most friendly relations between the sister Republics . That I have acted in the spirit of this assurance will appear from the events which have since occurred . Notwithstanding Mexico had abruptly terminated all diplomatic intercourse with the United States , and ought , therefore , to have been the first to ask for its resumption , yet , waiving all ceremony , I embraced the earliest favorable opportunity to ascertain from the Mexican Government whether they would receive an envoy from the United States intrusted with full power to adjust all the questions in dispute between the two Governments . In September , 1845 , I believed the propitious moment for such an overture had arrived . Texas , by the enthusiastic and almost unanimous will of her people , had pronounced in favor of annexation . Mexico herself had agreed to acknowledge the independence of Texas , subject to a condition , it is true , which she had no right to impose and no power to enforce . The last lingering hope of Mexico , if she still could have retained any , that Texas would ever again become one of her Provinces , must have been abandoned . The consul of the United States at the City of Mexico was therefore instructed by the Secretary of State on the 15th of September , 1845 , to make the inquiry of the Mexican Government . The inquiry was made , and on the 15th of October , 1845 , the minister of foreign affairs of the Mexican Government , in a note addressed to our consul , gave a favorable response , requesting at the same time that our naval force might be withdrawn from Vera Cruz while negotiations should be pending . Upon the receipt of this note our naval force was promptly withdrawn from Vera Cruz . A minister was immediately appointed , and departed to Mexico . Everything bore a promising aspect for a speedy and peaceful adjustment of all our difficulties . At the date of my annual message to Congress in December last no doubt was entertained but that he would be received by the Mexican Government , and the hope was cherished that all cause of misunderstanding between the two countries would be speedily removed . In the confident hope that such would be the result of his mission , I informed Congress that I forbore at that time to recommend such ulterior measures of redress for the wrongs and injuries we had so long borne as it would have been proper to make had no such negotiation been instituted . To my surprise and regret the Mexican Government , though solemnly pledged to do so , upon the arrival of our minister in Mexico refused to receive and accredit him . When he reached Vera Cruz , on the 30th of November , 1845 , he found that the aspect of affairs had undergone an unhappy change . The Government of General Herrera , who was at that time President of the Republic , was tottering to its fall . General Paredes , a military leader , had manifested his determination to overthrow the Government of Herrera by a military revolution , and one of the principal means which he employed to effect his purpose and render the Government of Herrera odious to the army and people of Mexico was by loudly condemning its determination to receive a minister of peace from the United States , alleging that it was the intention of Herrera , by a treaty with the United States , to dismember the territory of Mexico by ceding away the department of Texas . The Government of Herrera is believed to have been well disposed to a pacific adjustment of existing difficulties , but probably alarmed for its own security , and in order to ward off the danger of the revolution led by Paredes , violated its solemn agreement and refused to receive or accredit our minister and this although informed that he had been invested with full power to adjust all questions in dispute between the two Governments . Among the frivolous pretexts for this refusal , the principal one was that our minister had not gone upon a special mission confined to the question of Texas alone , leaving all the outrages upon our flag and our citizens unredressed . The Mexican Government well knew that both our national honor and the protection due to our citizens imperatively required that the two questions of boundary and indemnity should be treated of together , as naturally and inseparably blended , and they ought to have seen that this course was best calculated to enable the United States to extend to them the most liberal justice . On the 30th of December , 1845 , General Herrera resigned the Presidency and yielded up the Government to General Paredes without a struggle . Thus a revolution was accomplished solely by the army commanded by Paredes , and the supreme power in Mexico passed into the hands of a military usurper who was known to be bitterly hostile to the United States . Although the prospect of a pacific adjustment with the new Government was unpromising from the known hostility of its head to the United States , yet , determined that nothing should be left undone on our part to restore friendly relations between the two countries , our minister was instructed to present his credentials to the new Government and ask to be accredited by it in the diplomatic character in which he had been commissioned . These instructions he executed by his note of the 1st of March , 1846 , addressed to the Mexican minister of foreign affairs , but his request was insultingly refused by that minister in his answer of the 12th of the same month . No alternative remained for our minister but to demand his passports and return to the United States . Thus was the extraordinary spectacle presented to the civilized world of a Government , in violation of its own express agreement , having twice rejected a minister of peace invested with full powers to adjust all the existing differences between the two countries in a manner just and honorable to both . I am not aware that modern history presents a parallel case in which in time of peace one nation has refused even to hear propositions from another for terminating existing difficulties between them . Scarcely a hope of adjusting our difficulties , even at a remote day , or of preserving peace with Mexico , could be cherished while Paredes remained at the head of the Government . He had acquired the supreme power by a military revolution and upon the most solemn pledges to wage war against the United States and to reconquer Texas , which he claimed as a revolted province of Mexico . He had denounced as guilty of treason all those Mexicans who considered Texas as no longer constituting a part of the territory of Mexico and who were friendly to the cause of peace . The duration of the war which he waged against the United States was indefinite , because the end which he proposed of the reconquest of Texas was hopeless . Besides , there was good reason to believe from all his conduct that it was his intention to convert the Republic of Mexico into a monarchy and to call a foreign European prince to the throne . Preparatory to this end , he had during his short rule destroyed the liberty of the press , tolerating that portion of it only which openly advocated the establishment of a monarchy . The better to secure the success of his ultimate designs , he had by an arbitrary decree convoked a Congress , not to be elected by the free voice of the people , but to be chosen in a manner to make them subservient to his will and to give him absolute control over their deliberations . Under all these circumstances it was believed that any revolution in Mexico founded upon opposition to the ambitious projects of Paredes would tend to promote the cause of peace as well as prevent any attempted European interference in the affairs of the North American continent , both objects of deep interest to the United States . Any such foreign interference , if attempted , must have been resisted by the United States . My views upon that subject were fully communicated to Congress in my last annual message . In any event , it was certain that no change whatever in the Government of Mexico which would deprive Paredes of power could be for the worse so far as the United States were concerned , while it was highly probable that any change must be for the better . This was the state of affairs existing when Congress , on the 13th of May last , recognized the existence of the war which had been commenced by the Government of Paredes and it became an object of much importance , with a view to a speedy settlement of our difficulties and the restoration of an honorable peace , that Paredes should not retain power in Mexico . Before that time there were symptoms of a revolution in Mexico , favored , as it was understood to be , by the more liberal party , and especially by those who were opposed to foreign interference and to the monarchical form of government . Santa Anna was then in exile in Havana , having been expelled from power and banished from his country by a revolution which occurred in December , 1844 but it was known that he had still a considerable party in his favor in Mexico . It was also equally well known that no vigilance which could be exerted by our squadron would in all probability have prevented him from effecting a landing somewhere on the extensive Gulf coast of Mexico if he desired to return to his country . He had openly professed an entire change of policy , had expressed his regret that he had subverted the federal constitution of 1824 , and avowed that he was now in favor of its restoration . He had publicly declared his hostility , in strongest terms , to the establishment of a monarchy and to European interference in the affairs of his country . Information to this effect had been received , from sources believed to be reliable , at the date of the recognition of the existence of the war by Congress , and was afterwards fully confirmed by the receipt of the dispatch of our consul in the City of Mexico , with the accompanying documents , which are herewith transmitted . Besides , it was reasonable to suppose that he must see the ruinous consequences to Mexico of a war with the United States , and that it would be his interest to favor peace . It was under these circumstances and upon these considerations that it was deemed expedient not to obstruct his return to Mexico should he attempt to do so . Our object was the restoration of peace , and , with that view , no reason was perceived why we should take part with Paredes and aid him by means of our blockade in preventing the return of his rival to Mexico . On the contrary , it was believed that the intestine divisions which ordinary sagacity could not but anticipate as the fruit of Santa Anna s return to Mexico , and his contest with Paredes , might strongly tend to produce a disposition with both parties to restore and preserve peace with the United States . Paredes was a soldier by profession and a monarchist in principle . He had but recently before been successful in a military revolution , by which he had obtained power . He was the sworn enemy of the United States , with which he had involved his country in the existing war . Santa Anna had been expelled from power by the army , was known to be in open hostility to Paredes , and publicly pledged against foreign intervention and the restoration of monarchy in Mexico . In view of these facts and circumstances it was that when orders were issued to the commander of our naval forces in the Gulf , on the 13th day of May last , the same day on which the existence of the war was recognized by Congress , to place the coasts of Mexico under blockade , he was directed not to obstruct the passage of Santa Anna to Mexico should he attempt to return . A revolution took place in Mexico in the early part of August following , by which the power of Paredes was overthrown , and he has since been banished from the country , and is now in exile . Shortly afterwards Santa Anna returned . It remains to be seen whether his return may not yet prove to be favorable to a pacific adjustment of the existing difficulties , it being manifestly his interest not to persevere in the prosecution of a war commenced by Paredes to accomplish a purpose so absurd as the reconquest of Texas to the Sabine . Had Paredes remained in power , it is morally certain that any pacific adjustment would have been hopeless . Upon the commencement of hostilities by Mexico against the United States the indignant spirit of the nation was at once aroused . Congress promptly responded to the expectations of the country , and by the act of the 13th of May last recognized the fact that war existed , by the act of Mexico , between the United States and that Republic , and granted the means necessary for its vigorous prosecution . Being involved in a war thus commenced by Mexico , and for the justice of which on our part we may confidently appeal to the whole world , I resolved to prosecute it with the utmost vigor . Accordingly the ports of Mexico on the Gulf and on the Pacific have been placed under blockade and her territory invaded at several important points . The reports from the Departments of War and of the Navy will inform you more in detail of the measures adopted in the emergency in which our country was placed and of the gratifying results which have been accomplished . The various columns of the Army have performed their duty under great disadvantages with the most distinguished skill and courage . The victories of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and of Monterey , won against greatly superior numbers and against most decided advantages in other respects on the part of the enemy , were brilliant in their execution , and entitle our brave officers and soldiers to the grateful thanks of their country . The nation deplores the loss of the brave officers and men who have gallantly fallen while vindicating and defending their country s rights and honor . It is a subject of pride and satisfaction that our volunteer citizen soldiers , who so promptly responded to their country s call , with an experience of the discipline of a camp of only a few weeks , have borne their part in the hard fought battle of Monterey with a constancy and courage equal to that of veteran troops and worthy of the highest admiration . The privations of long marches through the enemy s country and through a wilderness have been borne without a murmur . By rapid movements the Province of New Mexico , with Santa Fe , its capital , has been captured without bloodshed . The Navy has cooperated with the Army and rendered important services if not so brilliant , it is because the enemy had no force to meet them on their own element and because of the defenses which nature has interposed in the difficulties of the navigation on the Mexican coast . Our squadron in the Pacific , with the cooperation of a gallant officer of the Army and a small force hastily collected in that distant country , has acquired bloodless possession of the Californias , and the American flag has been raised at every important point in that Province . I congratulate you on the success which has thus attended our military and naval operations . In less than seven months after Mexico commenced hostilities , at a time selected by herself , we have taken possession of many of her principal ports , driven back and pursued her invading army , and acquired military possession of the Mexican Provinces of New Mexico , New Leon , Coahuila , Tamaulipas , and the Californias , a territory larger in extent than that embraced in the original thirteen States of the Union , inhabited by a considerable population , and much of it more than 1 , 000 miles from the points at which we had to collect our forces and commence our movements . By the blockade the import and export trade of the enemy has been cut off . Well may the American people be proud of the energy and gallantry of our regular and volunteer officers and soldiers . The events of these few months afford a gratifying proof that our country can under any emergency confidently rely for the maintenance of her honor and the defense of her rights on an effective force , ready at all times voluntarily to relinquish the comforts of home for the perils and privations of the camp . And though such a force may be for the time expensive , it is in the end economical , as the ability to command it removes the necessity of employing a large standing army in time of peace , and proves that our people love their institutions and are ever ready to defend and protect them . While the war was in a course of vigorous and successful prosecution , being still anxious to arrest its evils , and considering that after the brilliant victories of our arms on the 8th and 9th of May last the national honor could not be compromitted by it , another overture was made to Mexico , by my direction , on the 27th of July last to terminate hostilities by a peace just and honorable to both countries . On the 31st of August following the Mexican Government declined to accept this friendly overture , but referred it to the decision of a Mexican Congress to be assembled in the early part of the present month . I communicate to you herewith a copy of the letter of the Secretary of State proposing to reopen negotiations , of the answer of the Mexican Government , and of the reply thereto of the Secretary of State , The war will continue to be prosecuted with vigor as the best means of securing peace . It is hoped that the decision of the Mexican Congress , to which our last overture has been referred , may result in a speedy and honorable peace . With our experience , however , of the unreasonable course of the Mexican authorities , it is the part of wisdom not to relax in the energy of our military operations until the result is made known . In this view it is deemed important to hold military possession of all the Provinces which have been taken until a definitive treaty of peace shall have been concluded and ratified by the two countries . The war has not been waged with a view to conquest , but , having been commenced by Mexico , it has been carried into the enemy s country and will be vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable peace , and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war , as well as to our much injured citizens , who hold large pecuniary demands against Mexico . By the laws of nations a conquered country is subject to be governed by the conqueror during his military possession and until there is either a treaty of peace or he shall voluntarily withdraw from it . The old civil government being necessarily superseded , it is the right and duty of the conqueror to secure his conquest and to provide for the maintenance of civil order and the rights of the inhabitants . This right has been exercised and this duty performed by our military and naval commanders by the establishment of temporary governments in some of the conquered Provinces of Mexico , assimilating them as far as practicable to the free institutions of our own country . In the Provinces of New Mexico and of the Californias little , if any , further resistance is apprehended from the inhabitants to the temporary governments which have thus , from the necessity of the case and according to the laws of war , been established . It may be proper to provide for the security of these important conquests by making an adequate appropriation for the purpose of erecting fortifications and defraying the expenses necessarily incident to the maintenance of our possession and authority over them . Near the close of your last session , for reasons communicated to Congress , I deemed it important as a measure for securing a speedy peace with Mexico , that a sum of money should be appropriated and placed in the power of the Executive , similar to that which had been made upon two former occasions during the Administration of President Jefferson . On the 26th of February , 1803 , an appropriation of 2 , 000 . 000 was made and placed at the disposal of the President . Its object is well known . It was at that time in contemplation to acquire Louisiana from France , and it was intended to be applied as a part of the consideration which might be paid for that territory . On the 13th of February , 1806 , the same sum was in like manner appropriated , with a view to the purchase of the Floridas from Spain . These appropriations were made to facilitate negotiations and as a means to enable the President to accomplish the important objects in view . Though it did not become necessary for the President to use these appropriations , yet a state of things might have arisen in which it would have been highly important for him to do so , and the wisdom of making them can not be doubted . It is believed that the measure recommended at your last session met with the approbation of decided majorities in both Houses of Congress . Indeed , in different forms , a bill making an appropriation of 2 , 000 , 000 passed each House , and it is much to be regretted that it did not become a law . The reasons which induced me to recommend the measure at that time still exist , and I again submit the subject for your consideration and suggest the importance of early action upon it . Should the appropriation be made and be not needed , it will remain in the Treasury should it be deemed proper to apply it in whole or in part , it will be accounted for as other public expenditures . Immediately after Congress had recognized the existence of the war with Mexico my attention was directed to the danger that privateers might be fitted out in the ports of Cuba and Porto Rico to prey upon the commerce of the United States , and I invited the special attention of the Spanish Government to the fourteenth article of our treaty with that power of the 27th of October , 1795 , under which the citizens and subjects of either nation who shall take commissions or letters of marque to act as privateers against the other shall be punished as pirates . It affords me pleasure to inform you that I have received assurances from the Spanish Government that this article of the treaty shall be faithfully observed on its part . Orders for this purpose were immediately transmitted from that Government to the authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico to exert their utmost vigilance in preventing any attempts to fit out privateers in those islands against the United States . From the good faith of Spain I am fully satisfied that this treaty will be executed in its spirit as well as its letter , whilst the United States will on their part faithfully perform all the obligations which it imposes on them . Information has been recently received at the Department of State that the Mexican Government has sent to Havana blank commissions to privateers and blank certificates of naturalization signed by General Salas , the present head of the Mexican Government . There is also reason to apprehend that similar documents have been transmitted to other parts of the world . Copies of these papers , in translation , are herewith transmitted . As the preliminaries required by the practice of civilized nations for commissioning privateers and regulating their conduct appear not to have been observed , and as these commissions are in blank , to be filled up with the names of citizens and subjects of all nations who may be willing to purchase them , the whole proceeding can only be construed as an invitation to all the freebooters upon earth who are willing to pay for the privilege to cruise against American commerce . It will be for our courts of justice to decide whether under such circumstances these Mexican letters of marque and reprisal shall protect those who accept them , and commit robberies upon the high seas under their authority , from the pains and penalties of piracy . If the certificates of naturalization thus granted be intended by Mexico to shield Spanish subjects from the guilt and punishment of pirates under our treaty with Spain , they will certainly prove unavailing . Such a subterfuge would be but a weak device to defeat the provisions of a solemn treaty . I recommend that Congress should immediately provide by law for the trial and punishment as pirates of Spanish subjects who , escaping the vigilance of their Government , shall be found guilty of privateering against the United States . I do not apprehend serious danger from these privateers . Our Navy will be constantly on the alert to protect our commerce . Besides , in case prizes should be made of American vessels , the utmost vigilance will be exerted by our blockading squadron to prevent the captors from taking them into Mexican ports , and it is not apprehended that any nation will violate its neutrality by suffering such prizes to be condemned and sold within its jurisdiction . I recommend that Congress should immediately provide by law for granting letters of marque and reprisal against vessels under the Mexican flag . It is true that there are but few , if any , commercial vessels of Mexico upon the high seas , and it is therefore not probable that many American privateers would be fitted out in case a law should pass authorizing this mode of warfare . It is , notwithstanding , certain that such privateers may render good service to the commercial interests of the country by recapturing our merchant ships should any be taken by armed vessels under the Mexican flag , as well as by capturing these vessels themselves . Every means within our power should be rendered available for the protection of our commerce . The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit a detailed statement of the condition of the finances . The imports for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of the value of 121 , 691 , 797 , of which the amount exported was 11 , 346 , 623 , leaving the amount retained in the country for domestic consumption 110 , 345 , 174 . The value of the exports for the same period was 113 , 488 , 516 , of which 102 , 141 , 893 consisted of domestic productions and 11 , 346 , 623 of foreign articles . The receipts into the Treasury for the same year were 29 , 499 , 247 . 06 , of which there was derived from customs 26 , 712 , 667 . 87 , from the sales of public lands 2 , 694 , 452 . 48 , and from incidental and miscellaneous sources 92 , 126 . 71 . The expenditures for the same period were 28 , 031 , 114 . 20 , and the balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July last was 9 , 126 , 439 . 08 . The amount of the public debt , including Treasury notes , on the 1st of the present month was 24 , 256 , 494 . 60 , of which the sum of 17 , 788 , 799 . 62 was outstanding on the 4th of March , 1845 , leaving the amount incurred since that time 6 , 467 , 694 . 98 . In order to prosecute the war with Mexico with vigor and energy , as the best means of bringing it to a speedy and honorable termination , a further loan will be necessary to meet the expenditures for the present and the next fiscal year . If the war should be continued until the 30th of June , 1848 , being the end of the next fiscal year , it is estimated that an additional loan of 23 , 000 , 000 will be required . This estimate is made upon the assumption that it will be necessary to retain constantly in the Treasury 4 , 000 , 000 to guard against contingencies . If such surplus were not required to be retained , then a loan of 19 , 000 , 000 would be sufficient . If , however , Congress should at the present session impose a revenue duty on the principal articles now embraced in the free list , it is estimated that an additional annual revenue of about two millions and a half , amounting , it is estimated , on the 30th of June , 1848 , to 4 , 000 , 000 , would be derived from that source , and the loan required would be reduced by that amount . It is estimated also that should Congress graduate and reduce the price of such of the public lands as have been long in the market the additional revenue derived from that source would be annually , for several years to come , between half a million and a million dollars and the loan required may be reduced by that amount also . Should these measures be adopted , the loan required would not probably exceed 18 , 000 , 000 or 19 , 000 , 000 , leaving in the Treasury a constant surplus of 4 , 000 , 000 . The loan proposed , it is estimated , will be sufficient to cover the necessary expenditures both for the war and for all other purposes up to the 30th of June , 1848 , and an amount of this loan not exceeding one half may be required during the present fiscal year , and the greater part of the remainder during the first half of the fiscal year succeeding . In order that timely notice may be given and proper measures taken to effect the loan , or such portion of it as may be required , it is important that the authority of Congress to make it be given at an early period of your present session . It is suggested that the loan should be contracted for a period of twenty years , with authority to purchase the stock and pay it off at an earlier period at its market value out of any surplus which may at any time be in the Treasury applicable to that purpose . After the establishment of peace with Mexico , it is supposed that a considerable surplus will exist , and that the debt may be extinguished in a much shorter period than that for which it may be contracted . The period of twenty years , as that for which the proposed loan may be contracted , in preference to a shorter period , is suggested , because all experience , both at home and abroad , has shown that loans are effected upon much better terms upon long time than when they are reimbursable at short dates . Necessary as this measure is to sustain the honor and the interests of the country engaged in a foreign war , it is not doubted but that Congress will promptly authorize it . The balance in the Treasury on the 1st July last exceeded 9 , 000 , 000 , notwithstanding considerable expenditures had been made for the war during the months of May and June preceding . But for the war the whole public debt could and would have been extinguished within a short period and it was a part of my settled policy to do so , and thus relieve the people from its burden and place the Government in a position which would enable it to reduce the public expenditures to that economical standard which is most consistent with the general welfare and the pure and wholesome progress of our institutions . Among our just causes of complaint against Mexico arising out of her refusal to treat for peace , as well before as since the war so unjustly commenced on her part , are the extraordinary expenditures in which we have been involved . Justice to our own people will make it proper that Mexico should be held responsible for these expenditures . Economy in the public expenditures is at all times a high duty which all public functionaries of the Government owe to the people . This duty becomes the more imperative in a period of war , when large and extraordinary expenditures become unavoidable . During the existence of the war with Mexico all our resources should be husbanded , and no appropriations made except such as are absolutely necessary for its vigorous prosecution and the due administration of the Government . Objects of appropriation which in peace may be deemed useful or proper , but which are not indispensable for the public service , may when the country is engaged in a foreign war be well postponed to a future period . By the observance of this policy at your present session large amounts may be saved to the Treasury and be applied to objects of pressing and urgent necessity , and thus the creation of a corresponding amount of public debt may be avoided . It is not meant to recommend that the ordinary and necessary appropriations for the support of Government should be withheld but it is well known that at every session of Congress appropriations are proposed for numerous objects which may or may not be made without materially affecting the public interests , and these it is recommended should not be granted . The act passed at your last session reducing the duties on imports not having gone into operation until the 1st of the present month , there has not been time for its practical effect upon the revenue and the business of the country to be developed . It is not doubted , however , that the just policy which it adopts will add largely to our foreign trade and promote the general prosperity . Although it can not be certainly foreseen what amount of revenue it will yield , it is estimated that it will exceed that produced by the act of 1842 , which it superseded . The leading principles established by it are to levy the taxes with a view to raise revenue and to impose them upon the articles imported according to their actual value . The act of 1842 , by the excessive rates of duty which it imposed on many articles , either totally excluded them from importation or greatly reduced the amount imported , and thus diminished instead of producing revenue . By it the taxes were imposed not for the legitimate purpose of raising revenue , but to afford advantages to favored classes at the expense of a large majority of their fellow citizens . Those employed in agriculture , mechanical pursuits , commerce , and navigation were compelled to contribute from their substance to swell the profits and overgrown wealth of the comparatively few who had invested their capital in manufactures . The taxes were not levied in proportion to the value of the articles upon which they were imposed , but , widely departing from this just rule , the lighter taxes were in many cases levied upon articles of luxury and high price and the heavier taxes on those of necessity and low price , consumed by the great mass of the people . It was a system the inevitable effect of which was to relieve favored classes and the wealthy few from contributing their just proportion for the support of Government , and to lay the burden on the labor of the many engaged in other pursuits than manufactures . A system so unequal and unjust has been superseded by the existing law , which imposes duties not for the benefit or injury of classes or pursuits , but distributes and , as far as practicable , equalizes the public burdens among all classes and occupations . The favored classes who under the unequal and unjust system which has been repealed have heretofore realized large profits , and many of them amassed large fortunes at the expense of the many who have been made tributary to them , will have no reason to complain if they shall be required to bear their just proportion of the taxes necessary for the support of Government . So far from it , it will be perceived by an examination of the existing law that discriminations in the rates of duty imposed within the revenue principle have been retained in their favor . The incidental aid against foreign competition which they still enjoy gives them an advantage which no other pursuits possess , but of this none others will complain , because the duties levied are necessary for revenue . These revenue duties , including freights and charges , which the importer must pay before he can come in competition with the home manufacturer in our markets , amount on nearly all our leading branches of manufacture to more than one third of the value of the imported article , and in some cases to almost one half its value . With such advantages it is not doubted that our domestic manufacturers will continue to prosper , realizing in well conducted establishments even greater profits than can be derived from any other regular business . Indeed , so far from requiring the protection of even incidental revenue duties , our manufacturers in several leading branches are extending their business , giving evidence of great ingenuity and skill and of their ability to compete , with increased prospect of success , for the open market of the world . Domestic manufactures to the value of several millions of dollars , which can not find a market at home , are annually exported to foreign countries . With such rates of duty as those established by the existing law the system will probably be permanent , and capitalists who are made or shall hereafter make their investments in manufactures will know upon what to rely . The country will be satisfied with these rates , because the advantages which the manufacturers still enjoy result necessarily from the collection of revenue for the support of Government . High protective duties , from their unjust operation upon the masses of the people , can not fail to give rise to extensive dissatisfaction and complaint and to constant efforts to change or repeal them , rendering all investments in manufactures uncertain and precarious . Lower and more permanent rates of duty , at the same time that they will yield to the manufacturer fair and remunerating profits , will secure him against the danger of frequent changes in the system , which can not fail to ruinously affect his interests . Simultaneously with the relaxation of the restrictive policy by the United States , Great Britain , from whose example we derived the system , has relaxed hers . She has modified her corn laws and reduced many other duties to moderate revenue rates . After ages of experience the statesmen of that country have been constrained by a stern necessity and by a public opinion having its deep foundation in the sufferings and wants of impoverished millions to abandon a system the effect of which was to build up immense fortunes in the hands of the few and to reduce the laboring millions to pauperism and misery . Nearly in the same ratio that labor was depressed capital was increased and concentrated by the British protective policy . The evils of the system in Great Britain were at length rendered intolerable , and it has been abandoned , but not without a severe struggle on the part of the protected and favored classes to retain the unjust advantages which they have so long enjoyed . It was to be expected that a similar struggle would be made by the same classes in the United States whenever an attempt was made to modify or abolish the same unjust system here . The protective policy had been in operation in the United States for a much shorter period , and its pernicious effects were not , therefore , so clearly perceived and felt . Enough , however , was known of these effects to induce its repeal . It would be strange if in the face of the example of Great Britain , our principal foreign customer , and of the evils of a system rendered manifest in that country by long and painful experience , and in the face of the immense advantages which under a more liberal commercial policy we are already deriving , and must continue to derive , by supplying her starving population with food , the United States should restore a policy which she has been compelled to abandon , and thus diminish her ability to purchase from us the food and other articles which she so much needs and we so much desire to sell . By the simultaneous abandonment of the protective policy by Great Britain and the United States new and important markets have already been opened for our agricultural and other products , commerce and navigation have received a new impulse , labor and trade have been released from the artificial trammels which have so long fettered them , and to a great extent reciprocity in the exchange of commodities has been introduced at the same time by both countries , and greatly for the benefit of both . Great Britain has been forced by the pressure of circumstances at home to abandon a policy which has been upheld for ages , and to open her markets for our immense surplus of breadstuffs , and it is confidently believed that other powers of Europe will ultimately see the wisdom , if they be not compelled by the pauperism and sufferings of their crowded population , to pursue a similar policy . Our farmers are more deeply interested in maintaining the just and liberal policy of the existing law than any other class of our citizens . They constitute a large majority of our population , and it is well known that when they prosper all other pursuits prosper also . They have heretofore not only received none of the bounties or favors of Government , but by the unequal operations of the protective policy have been made by the burdens of taxation which it imposed to contribute to the bounties which have enriched others . When a foreign as well as a home market is opened to them , they must receive , as they are now receiving , increased prices for their products . They will find a readier sale , and at better prices , for their wheat , flour , rice , Indian corn , beef , pork , lard , butter , cheese , and other articles which they produce . The home market alone is inadequate to enable them to dispose of the immense surplus of food and other articles which they are capable of producing , even at the most reduced prices , for the manifest reason that they can not be consumed in the country . The United States can from their immense surplus supply not only the home demand , but the deficiencies of food required by the whole world . That the reduced production of some of the chief articles of food in Great Britain and other parts of Europe may have contributed to increase the demand for our breadstuffs and provisions is not doubted , but that the great and efficient cause of this increased demand and of increased prices consists in the removal of artificial restrictions heretofore imposed is deemed to be equally certain . That our exports of food , already increased and increasing beyond former example under the more liberal policy which has been adopted , will be still vastly enlarged unless they be checked or prevented by a restoration of the protective policy can not be doubted . That our commercial and navigating interests will be enlarged in a corresponding ratio with the increase of our trade is equally certain , while our manufacturing interests will still be the favored interests of the country and receive the incidental protection afforded them by revenue duties and more than this they can not justly demand . In my annual message of December last a tariff of revenue duties based upon the principles of the existing law was recommended , and I have seen no reason to change the opinions then expressed . In view of the probable beneficial effects of that law , I recommend that the policy established by it be maintained . It has but just commenced to operate , and to abandon or modify it without giving it a fair trial would be inexpedient and unwise . Should defects in any of its details be ascertained by actual experience to exist , these may be hereafter corrected but until such defects shall become manifest the act should be fairly tested . It is submitted for your consideration whether it may not be proper , as a war measure , to impose revenue duties on some of the articles now embraced in the free list . Should it be deemed proper to impose such duties with a view to raise revenue to meet the expenses of the war with Mexico or to avoid to that extent the creation of a public debt , they may be repealed when the emergency which gave rise to them shall cease to exist , and constitute no part of the permanent policy of the country . The act of the 6th of August last , to provide for the better organization of the Treasury and for the collection , safe keeping , transfer , and disbursement of the public revenue , has been carried into execution as rapidly as the delay necessarily arising out of the appointment of new officers , taking and approving their bonds , and preparing and securing proper places for the safe keeping of the public money would permit . It is not proposed to depart in any respect from the principles or policy on which this great measure is rounded . There are , however , defects in the details of the measure , developed by its practical operation , which are fully set forth in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury , to which the attention of Congress is invited . These defects would impair to some extent the successful operation of the law at all times , but are especially embarrassing when the country is engaged in a war , when the expenditures are greatly increased , when loans are to be effected and the disbursements are to be made at points many hundred miles distant , in some cases , from any depository , and a large portion of them in a foreign country . The modifications suggested in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury are recommended to your favorable consideration . In connection with this subject I invite your attention to the importance of establishing a branch of the Mint of the United States at New York . Two thirds of the revenue derived from customs being collected at that point , the demand for specie to pay the duties will be large , and a branch mint where foreign coin and bullion could be immediately converted into American coin would greatly facilitate the transaction of the public business , enlarge the circulation of gold and silver , and be at the same time a safe depository of the public money . The importance of graduating and reducing the price of such of the public lands as have been long offered in the market at the minimum rate authorized by existing laws , and remain unsold , induces me again to recommend the subject to your favorable consideration . Many millions of acres of these lands have been offered in the market for more than thirty years and larger quantities for more than ten or twenty years , and , being of an inferior quality , they must remain unsalable for an indefinite period unless the price at which they may be purchased shall be reduced . To place a price upon them above their real value is not only to prevent their sale , and thereby deprive the Treasury of any income from that source , but is unjust to the States in which they lie , because it retards their growth and increase of population , and because they have no power to levy a tax upon them as upon other lands within their limits , held by other proprietors than the United States , for the support of their local governments . The beneficial effects of the graduation principle have been realized by some of the States owning the lands within their limits in which it has been adopted . They have been demonstrated also by the United States acting as the trustee of the Chickasaw tribe of Indians in the sale of their lands lying within the States of Mississippi and Alabama . The Chickasaw lands , which would not command in the market the minimum price established by the laws of the United States for the sale of their lands , were , in pursuance of the treaty of 1834 with that tribe , subsequently offered for sale at graduated and reduced rates for limited periods . The result was that large quantities of these lands were purchased which would otherwise have remained unsold . The lands were disposed of at their real value , and many persons of limited means were enabled to purchase small tracts , upon which they have settled with their families . That similar results would be produced by the adoption of the graduation policy by the United States in all the States in which they are the owners of large bodies of lands which have been long in the market can not be doubted . It can not be a sound policy to withhold large quantities of the public lands from the use and occupation of our citizens by fixing upon them prices which experience has shown they will not command . On the contrary , it is a wise policy to afford facilities to our citizens to become the owners at low and moderate rates of freeholds of their own instead of being the tenants and dependents of others . If it be apprehended that these lands if reduced in price would be secured in large quantities by speculators or capitalists , the sales may be restricted in limited quantities to actual settlers or persons purchasing for purposes of cultivation . In my last annual message I submitted for the consideration of Congress the present system of managing the mineral lands of the United States , and recommended that they should be brought into market and sold upon such terms and under such restrictions as Congress might prescribe . By the act of the 11th of July last the reserved lead mines and contiguous lands in the States of Illinois and Arkansas and Territories of Wisconsin and Iowa were authorized to be sold . The act is confined in its operation to lead mines and contiguous lands . A large portion of the public lands , containing copper and other ores , is represented to be very valuable , and I recommend that provision be made authorizing the sale of these lands upon such terms and conditions as from their supposed value may in the judgment of Congress be deemed advisable , having due regard to the interests of such of our citizens as may be located upon them . It will be important during your present session to establish a Territorial government and to extend the jurisdiction and laws of the United States over the Territory of Oregon . Our laws regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains should be extended to the Pacific Ocean and for the purpose of executing them and preserving friendly relations with the Indian tribes within our limits , an additional number of Indian agencies will be required , and should be authorized by law . The establishment of custom houses and of post offices and post roads and provision for the transportation of the mail on such routes as the public convenience will suggest require legislative authority . It will be proper also to establish a surveyor general s office in that Territory and to make the necessary provision for surveying the public lands and bringing them into market . As our citizens who now reside in that distant region have been subjected to many hardships , privations , and sacrifices in their emigration , and by their improvements have enhanced the value of the public lands in the neighborhood of their settlements , it is recommended that liberal grants be made to them ot such portions of these lands as they may occupy , and that similar grants or rights of preemption be made to all who may emigrate thither within a limited period , prescribed by law . The report of the Secretary of War contains detailed information relative to the several branches of the public service connected with that Department . The operations of the Army have been of a satisfactory and highly gratifying character . I recommend to your early and favorable consideration the measures proposed by the Secretary of War for speedily filling up the rank and file of the Regular Army , for its greater efficiency in the field , and for raising an additional force to serve during the war with Mexico . Embarrassment is likely to arise for want of legal provision authorizing compensation to be made to the agents employed in the several States and Territories to pay the Revolutionary and other pensioners the amounts allowed them by law . Your attention is invited to the recommendations of the Secretary of War on this subject . These agents incur heavy responsibilities and perform important duties , and no reason exists why they should not be placed on the same footing as to compensation with other disbursing officers . Our relations with the various Indian tribes continue to be of a pacific character . The unhappy dissensions which have existed among the Cherokees for many years past have been healed . Since my last annual message important treaties have been negotiated with some of the tribes , by which the Indian title to large tracts of valuable land within the limits of the States and Territories has been extinguished and arrangements made for removing them to the country west of the Mississippi . Between 3 , 000 and 4 , 000 of different tribes have been removed to the country provided for them by treaty stipulations , and arrangements have been made for others to follow . In our intercourse with the several tribes particular attention has been given to the important subject of education . The number of schools established among them has been increased , and additional means provided not only for teaching them the rudiments of education , but of instructing them in agriculture and the mechanic arts . I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a satisfactory view of the operations of the Department under his charge during the past year . It is gratifying to perceive that while the war with Mexico has rendered it necessary to employ an unusual number of our armed vessels on her coasts , the protection due to our commerce in other quarters of the world has not proved insufficient . No means will be spared to give efficiency to the naval service in the prosecution of the war and I am happy to know that the officers and men anxiously desire to devote themselves to the service of their country in any enterprise , however difficult of execution . I recommend to your favorable consideration the proposition to add to each of our foreign squadrons an efficient sea steamer , and , as especially demanding attention , the establishment at Pensacola of the necessary means of repairing and refitting the vessels of the Navy employed in the Gulf of Mexico . There are other suggestions in the report which deserve and I doubt not will receive your consideration . The progress and condition of the mail service for the past year are fully presented in the report of the Postmaster General . The revenue for the year ending on the 30th of June last amounted to 3 , 487 , 199 , which is 802 , 642 . 45 less than that of the preceding year . The payments for that Department during the same time amounted to 4 , 084 , 297 . 22 . Of this sum 597 , 097 . 80 have been drawn from the Treasury . The disbursements for the year were 236 , 434 . 77 less than those of the preceding year . While the disbursements have been thus diminished , the mail facilities have been enlarged by new mail routes of 5 , 739 miles , an increase of transportation of 1 , 764 , 145 miles , and the establishment of 418 new post offices . Contractors , postmasters , and others engaged in this branch of the service have performed their duties with energy and faithfulness deserving commendation . For many interesting details connected with the operations of this establishment you are referred to the report of the Postmaster General , and his suggestions for improving its revenues are recommended to your favorable consideration . I repeat the opinion expressed in my last annual message that the business of this Department should be so regulated that the revenues derived from it should be made to equal the expenditures , and it is believed that this may be done by proper modifications of the present laws , as suggested in the report of the Postmaster General , without changing the present rates of postage . With full reliance upon the wisdom and patriotism of your deliberations , it will be my duty , as it will be my anxious desire , to cooperate with you in every constitutional effort to promote the welfare and maintain the honor of our common country .<speech_sep>Whereas a treaty of peace , friendship , limits , and settlement between the United States of America and the Mexican Republic was concluded and signed at the city of Guadalupe Hidalgo on the 2d day of February , 1848 , which treaty , as amended by the Senate of the United States , and being in the English and Spanish languages , is word for word as follows Here follows the treaty .

Done at the city of Washington , this 4th day of July , 1848 , and of the Independence of the United States the seventy third . JAMES POLK . By the President JAMES BUCHANASecretary of State .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States When the President has given his official sanction to a bill which has passed Congress , usage requires that he shall notify the House in which it originated of that fact . The mode of giving this notification has been by an oral message delivered by his private secretary . Having this day approved and signed an act entitled An act to establish the Territorial government of Oregon , I deem it proper , under the existing circumstances , to communicate the fact in a more solemn form . The deeply interesting and protracted discussions which have taken place in both Houses of Congress and the absorbing interest which the subject has excited throughout the country justify , in my judgment , this departure from the form of notice observed in other cases . In this communication with a coordinate branch of the Government , made proper by the considerations referred to , I shall frankly and without reserve express the reasons which have constrained me not to withhold my signature from the bill to establish a government over Oregon , even though the two territories of New Mexico and California are to be left for the present without governments . None doubt that it is proper to establish a government in Oregon . Indeed , it has been too long delayed . I have made repeated recommendations to Congress to this effect . The petitions of the people of that distant region have been presented to the Government , and ought not to be disregarded . To give to them a regularly organized government and the protection of our laws , which , as citizens of the United States , they claim , is a high duty on our part , and one which we are bound to perform , unless there be controlling reasons to prevent it . In the progress of all governments questions of such transcendent importance occasionally arise as to cast in the shade all those of a mere party character . But one such question can now be agitated in this country , and this may endanger our glorious Union , the source of our greatness and all our political blessings . This question is slavery . With the slaveholding States this does not embrace merely the rights of property , however valuable , but it ascends far higher , and involves the domestic peace and security of every family . The fathers of the Constitution , the wise and patriotic men who laid the foundation of our institutions , foreseeing the danger from this quarter , acted in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession on this dangerous and delicate subject , and their wisdom ought to be the guide of their successors . Whilst they left to the States exclusively the question of domestic slavery within their respective limits , they provided that slaves who might escape into other States not recognizing the institution of slavery shall be delivered up on the claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . Upon this foundation the matter rested until the Missouri question arose . In December , 1819 , application was made to Congress by the people of the Missouri Territory for admission into the Union as a State . The discussion upon the subject in Congress involved the question of slavery , and was prosecuted with such violence as to produce excitements alarming to every patriot in the Union . But the good genius of conciliation , which presided at the birth of our institutions , finally prevailed , and the Missouri compromise was adopted . The eighth section of the act of Congress of the 6th of March , 1820 , To authorize the people of the Missouri Territory to form a constitution and State government etc . , provides That in all that territory ceded by France to the United States under the name of Louisiana which lies north of 36 degree 30 north latitude , not included within the limits of the State contemplated by this act , slavery and involuntary servitude , otherwise than in the punishment of crimes , whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted , shall be , and is hereby , forever prohibited Provided always , That any person escaping into the same from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any State or Territory of the United States , such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid . This compromise had the effect of calming the troubled waves and restoring peace and good will throughout the States of the Union . The Missouri question had excited intense agitation of the public mind , and threatened to divide the country into geographical parties , alienating the feelings of attachment which each portion of our Union should bear to every other . The compromise allayed the excitement , tranquilized the popular mind , and restored confidence and fraternal feelings . Its authors were hailed as public benefactors . I do not doubt that a similar adjustment of the questions which now agitate the public mind would produce the same happy results . If the legislation of Congress on the subject of the other Territories shall not be adopted in a spirit of conciliation and compromise , it is impossible that the country can be satisfied or that the most disastrous consequences shall fail to ensue . When Texas was admitted into the Union , the same spirit of compromise which guided our predecessors in the admission of Missouri a quarter of a century before prevailed without any serious opposition . The joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United States , approved March 1 , 1845 , provides that Such States as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying south of 36 deg 30 north latitude , commonly known as the Missouri compromise line , shall be admitted into the Union with or without slavery , as the people of each State asking admission may desire and in such State or States as shall be formed out of said territory north of the Missouri compromise line slavery or involuntary servitude except for crime shall be prohibited . The Territory of Oregon lies far north of 36 deg 30 , the Missouri and Texas compromise line . Its southern boundary is the parallel of 42 deg , leaving the intermediate distance to be 330 geographical miles . And it is because the provisions of this bill are not inconsistent with the laws of the Missouri compromise , if extended from the Rio Grande to the Pacific Ocean , that I have not felt at liberty to withhold my sanction . Had it embraced territories south of that compromise , the question presented for my consideration would have been of a far different character , and my action upon it must have corresponded with my convictions . Ought we now to disturb the Missouri and Texas compromises Ought we at this late day , in attempting to annul what has been so long established and acquiesced in , to excite sectional divisions and jealousies , to alienate the people of different portions of the Union from each other , and to endanger the existence of the Union itself From the adoption of the Federal Constitution , during a period of sixty years , our progress as a nation has been without example in the annals of history . Under the protection of a bountiful Providence , we have advanced with giant strides in the career of wealth and prosperity . We have enjoyed the blessings of freedom to a greater extent than any other people , ancient or modern , under a Government which has preserved order and secured to every citizen life , liberty , and property . We have now become an example for imitation to the whole world . The friends of freedom in every clime point with admiration to our institutions . Shall we , then , at the moment when the people of Europe are devoting all their energies in the attempt to assimilate their institutions to our own , peril all our blessings by despising the lessons of experience and refusing to tread in the footsteps which our fathers have trodden And for what cause would we endanger our glorious Union The Missouri compromise contains a prohibition of slavery throughout all that vast region extending twelve and a half degrees along the Pacific , from the parallel of 36 deg 30 to that of 49 deg , and east from that ocean to and beyond the summit of the Rocky Mountains . Why , then , should our institutions be endangered because it is proposed to submit to the people of the remainder of our newly acquired territory lying south of 36 deg 30 , embracing less than four degrees of latitude , the question whether , in the language of the Texas compromise , they shall be admitted as a State into the Union with or without slavery . Is this a question to be pushed to such extremities by excited partisans on the one side or the other , in regard to our newly acquired distant possessions on the Pacific , as to endanger the Union of thirty glorious States , which constitute our Confederacy I have an abiding confidence that the sober reflection and sound patriotism of the people of all the States will bring them to the conclusion that the dictate of wisdom is to follow the example of those who have gone before us , and settle this dangerous question on the Missouri compromise , or some other equitable compromise which would respect the rights of all and prove satisfactory to the different portions of the Union . Holding as a sacred trust the Executive authority for the whole Union , and bound to guard the rights of all , I should be constrained by a sense of duty to withhold my official sanction from any measure which would conflict with these important objects . I can not more appropriately close this message than by quoting from the Farewell Address of the Father of his Country . His warning voice can never be heard in vain by the American people . If the spirit of prophecy had distinctly presented to his view more than a half century ago the present distracted condition of his country , the language which he then employed could not have been more appropriate than it is to the present occasion . He declared The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you . It is justly so , for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence , the support of your tranquillity at home , your peace abroad , of your safety , of your prosperity , of that very liberty which you so highly prize . But as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken , many artifices employed , to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth , as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively though often covertly and insidiously directed , it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial , habitual , and immovable attachment to it accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned , and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts . For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest . Citizens by birth or choice of a common country , that country has a right to concentrate your affections . The name of American , which belongs to you in your national capacity , must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations . With slight shades of difference , you have the same religion , manners , habits , and political principles . You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together . The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts , of common dangers , sufferings , and successes . With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country , while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability , there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its hands . In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations Northern and Southern , Atlantic and Western whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views . One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts . You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives of the United States In reply to the resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 5th instant , I communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of State , accompanied with all the documents and correspondence relating to the treaty of peace concluded between the United States and Mexico at Guadalupe Hidalgo on the 2d February , 1848 , and to the amendments of the Senate thereto , as requested by the House in the said resolutions . Amongst the documents transmitted will be found a copy of the instructions given to the commissioners of the United States who took to Mexico the treaty as amended by the Senate and ratified by the President of the United States . In my message to the House of Representatives of the 29th of July , 1848 , I gave as my reason for declining to furnish these instructions in compliance with a resolution of the House that in my opinion it would be inconsistent with the public interests to give publicity to them at the present time . Although it may still be doubted whether giving them publicity in our own country , and , as a necessary consequence , in Mexico , may not have a prejudicial influence on our public interests , yet , as they have been again called for by the House , and called for in connection with other documents , to the correct understanding of which they are indispensable , I have deemed it my duty to transmit them . I still entertain the opinion expressed in the message referred to , that As a general rule applicable to all our important negotiations with foreign powers , it could not fail to be prejudicial to the public interests to publish the instructions to our ministers until some time had elapsed after the conclusion of such negotiations . In these instructions of the 18th of March , 1848 , it will be perceived that The task was assigned to the commissioners of the United States of consummating the treaty of peace , which was signed at Guadalupe Hidalgo on the 2d day of February last , between the United States and the Mexican Republic , and which on the 10th of March last was ratified by the Senate with amendments . They were informed that This brief statement will indicate to you clearly the line of your duty . You are not sent to Mexico for the purpose of negotiating any new treaty , or of changing in any particular the ratified treaty which you will bear with you . None of the amendments adopted by the Senate can be rejected or modified except by the authority of that body . Your whole duty will , then , consist in using every honorable effort to obtain from the Mexican Government a ratification of the treaty in the form in which it has been ratified by the Senate , and this with the least practicable delay . For this purpose it may , and most probably will , become necessary that you should explain to the Mexican minister for foreign affairs , or to the authorized agents of the Mexican Government , the reasons which have influenced the Senate in adopting these several amendments to the treaty . This duty you will perform as much as possible by personal conferences . Diplomatic notes are to be avoided unless in case of necessity . These might lead to endless discussions and indefinite delay . Besides , they could not have any practical result , as your mission is confined to procuring a ratification from the Mexican Government of the treaty as it came from the Senate , and does not extend to the slightest modification in any of its provisions . The commissioners were sent to Mexico to procure the ratification of the treaty as amended by the Senate . Their instructions confined them to this point . It was proper that the amendments to the treaty adopted by the United States should be explained to the Mexican Government , and explanations were made by the Secretary of State in his letter of the 18th of March , 1848 , to the Mexican minister for foreign affairs , under my direction . This dispatch was communicated to Congress with my message of the 6th of July last , communicating the treaty of peace , and published by their order . This dispatch was transmitted by our commissioners from the City of Mexico to the Mexican Government , then at Queretaro , on the 17th of April , 1848 , and its receipt acknowledged on the 19th of the same month . During the whole time that the treaty , as amended , was before the Congress of Mexico these explanations of the Secretary of State , and these alone , were before them . The President of Mexico , on these explanations , on the 8th day of May , 1848 , submitted the amended treaty to the Mexican Congress , and on the 25th of May that Congress approved the treaty as amended , without modification or alteration . The final action of the Mexican Congress had taken place before the commissioners of the United States had been officially received by the Mexican authorities , or held any conference with them , or had any other communication on the subject of the treaty except to transmit the letter of the Secretary of State . In their dispatch transmitted to Congress with my message of the 6th of July last , communicating the treaty of peace , dated City of Queretaro , May 25 , 1848 , 9 of the clock p . m . , the commissioners say We have the satisfaction to inform you that we reached this city this afternoon at about 5 of the clock , and that the treaty , as amended by the Senate of the United States , passed the Mexican Senate about the hour of our arrival by a vote of 33 to 5 . It having previously passed the House of Deputies , nothing now remains but to exchange the ratifications of the treaty . On the next day the 26th of May the commissioners were for the first time presented to the President of the Republic and their credentials placed in his hands . On this occasion the commissioners delivered an address to the President of Mexico , and he replied . In their dispatch of the 30th of May the commissioners say We inclose a copy of our address to the President , and also a copy of his reply . Several conferences afterwards took place between Rosa , Cuevas , Conto , and ourselves , which it is not thought necessary to recapitulate , as we inclose a copy of the protocol , which contains the substance of the conversations . We have now the satisfaction to announce that the exchange of ratifications was effected to day . This dispatch was communicated with my message of the 6th of July last , and published by order of Congress . The treaty , as amended by the Senate of the United States , with the accompanying papers and the evidence that in that form it had been ratified by Mexico , was received at Washington on the 4th day of July , 1848 , and immediately proclaimed as the supreme law of the land . On the 6th of July I communicated to Congress the ratified treaty , with such accompanying documents as were deemed material to a full understanding of the subject , to the end that Congress might adopt the legislation necessary and proper to carry the treaty into effect . Neither the address of the commissioners , nor the reply of the President of Mexico on the occasion of their presentation , nor the memorandum of conversations embraced in the paper called a protocol , nor the correspondence now sent , were communicated , because they were not regarded as in any way material and in this I conformed to the practice of our Government . It rarely , if ever , happens that all the correspondence , and especially the instructions to our ministers , is communicated . Copies of these papers are now transmitted , as being within the resolutions of the House calling for all such correspondence as appertains to said treaty . When these papers were received at Washington , peace had been restored , the first installment of three millions paid to Mexico , the blockades were raised , the City of Mexico evacuated , and our troops on their return home . The war was at an end , and the treaty , as ratified by the United States , was binding on both parties , and already executed in a great degree . In this condition of things it was not competent for the President alone , or for the President and Senate , or for the President , Senate , and House of Representatives combined , to abrogate the treaty , to annul the peace and restore a state of war , except by a solemn declaration of war . Had the protocol varied the treaty as amended by the Senate of the United States , it would have had no binding effect . It was obvious that the commissioners of the United States did not regard the protocol as in any degree a part of the treaty , nor as modifying or altering the treaty as amended by the Senate . They communicated it as the substance of conversations held after the Mexican Congress had ratified the treaty , and they knew that the approval of the Mexican Congress was as essential to the validity of a treaty in all its parts as the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States . They knew , too , that they had no authority to alter or modify the treaty in the form in which it had been ratified by the United States , but that , if failing to procure the ratification of the Mexican Government otherwise than with amendments , their duty , imposed by express instructions , was to ask of Mexico to send without delay a commissioner to Washington to exchange ratifications here if the amendments of the treaty proposed by Mexico , on being submitted , should be adopted by the Senate of the United States . I was equally well satisfied that the Government of Mexico had agreed to the treaty as amended by the Senate of the United States , and did not regard the protocol as modifying , enlarging , or diminishing its terms or effect . The President of that Republic , in submitting the amended treaty to the Mexican Congress , in his message on the 8th day of May , 1848 , said If the treaty could have been submitted to your deliberation precisely as it came from the hands of the plenipotentiaries , my satisfaction at seeing the war at last brought to an end would not have been lessened as it this day is in consequence of the modifications introduced into it by the Senate of the United States , and which have received the sanction of the President . At present it is sufficient for us to say to you that if in the opinion of the Government justice had not been evinced on the part of the Senate and Government of the United States in introducing such modifications , it is presumed , on the other hand , that they are not of such importance that they should set aside the treaty . I believe , on the contrary , that it ought to be ratified upon the same terms in which it has already received the sanction of the American Government . My opinion is also greatly strengthened by the fact that a new negotiation is neither expected nor considered possible . Much less could another be brought forward upon a basis more favorable for the Republic . The deliberations of the Mexican Congress , with no explanation before that body from the United States except the letter of the Secretary of State , resulted in the ratification of the treaty , as recommended by the President of that Republic , in the form in which it had been amended and ratified by the United States . The conversations embodied in the paper called a protocol took place after the action of the Mexican Congress was complete , and there is no reason to suppose that the Government of Mexico ever submitted the protocol to the Congress , or ever treated or regarded it as in any sense a new negotiation , or as operating any modification or change of the amended treaty . If such had been its effect , it was a nullity until approved by the Mexican Congress and such approval was never made or intimated to the United States . In the final consummation of the ratification of the treaty by the President of Mexico no reference is made to it . On the contrary , this ratification , which was delivered to the commissioners of the United States , and is now in the State Department , contains a full and explicit recognition of the amendments of the Senate just as they had been communicated to that Government by the Secretary of State and been afterwards approved by the Mexican Congress . It declares that Having seen and examined the said treaty and the modifications made by the Senate of the United States of America , and having given an account thereof to the General Congress , conformably to the requirement in the fourteenth paragraph of the one hundred and tenth article of the federal constitution of these United States , that body has thought proper to approve of the said treaty , with the modifications thereto , in all their parts and in consequence thereof , exerting the power granted to me by the constitution , I accept , ratify , and confirm the said treaty with its modifications , and promise , in the name of the Mexican Republic , to fulfill and observe it , and to cause it to be fulfilled and observed . Upon an examination of this protocol , when it was received with the ratified treaty , I did not regard it as material or as in any way attempting to modify or change the treaty as it had been amended by the Senate of the United States . The first explanation which it contains is That the American Government , by suppressing the ninth article of the treaty of Guadalupe and substituting the third article of the treaty of Louisiana , did not intend to diminish in any way what was agreed upon by the aforesaid article ninth in favor of the inhabitants of the territories ceded by Mexico . Its understanding is that all of that agreement is contained in the third article of the treaty of Louisiana . In consequence , all the privileges and guaranties civil , political , and religious which would have been possessed by the inhabitants of the ceded territories if the ninth article of the treaty had been retained will be enjoyed by them without any difference under the article which has been substituted . The ninth article of the original treaty stipulated for the incorporation of the Mexican inhabitants of the ceded territories and their admission into the Union as soon as possible , according to the principles of the Federal Constitution , to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States . It provided also that in the meantime they should be maintained in the enjoyment of their liberty , their property , and their civil rights now vested in them according to the Mexican laws . It secured to them similar political rights with the inhabitants of the other Territories of the United States , and at least equal to the inhabitants of Louisiana and Florida when they were in a Territorial condition . It then proceeded to guarantee that ecclesiastics and religious corporations should be protected in the discharge of the offices of their ministry and the enjoyment of their property of every kind , whether individual or corporate , and , finally , that there should be a free communication between the Catholics of the ceded territories and their ecclesiastical authorities even although such authority should reside within the limits of the Mexican Republic as defined by this treaty . The ninth article of the treaty , as adopted by the Senate , is much more comprehensive in its terms and explicit in its meaning , and it clearly embraces in comparatively few words all the guaranties inserted in the original article . It is as follows Mexicans who , in the territories aforesaid , shall not preserve the character of citizens of the Mexican Republic , conformably with what is stipulated in the preceding article , shall be incorporated into the Union of the United States and be admitted at the proper time to be judged of by the Congress of the United States to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States , according to the principles of the Constitution , and in the meantime shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction . This article , which was substantially copied from the Louisiana treaty , provides equally with the original article for the admission of these inhabitants into the Union , and in the meantime , whilst they shall remain in a Territorial state , by one sweeping provision declares that they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction . This guaranty embraces every kind of property , whether held by ecclesiastics or laymen , whether belonging to corporations or individuals . It secures to these inhabitants the free exercise of their religion without restriction , whether they choose to place themselves under the spiritual authority of pastors resident within the Mexican Republic or the ceded territories . It was , it is presumed , to place this construction beyond all question that the Senate superadded the words without restriction to the religious guaranty contained in the corresponding article of the Louisiana treaty . Congress itself does not possess the power under the Constitution to make any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion . If the ninth article of the treaty , whether in its original or amended form , had been entirely omitted in the treaty , all the rights and privileges which either of them confers would have been secured to the inhabitants of the ceded territories by the Constitution and laws of the United States . The protocol asserts that the American Government , by suppressing the tenth article of the treaty of Guadalupe , did not in any way intend to annul the grants of lands made by Mexico in the ceded territories that these grants , notwithstanding the suppression of the article of the treaty , preserve the legal value which they may possess and the grantees may cause their legitimate titles to be acknowledged before the American tribunals and then proceeds to state that , conformably to the law of the United States , legitimate titles to every description of property , personal and real , existing in the ceded territories are those which were legitimate titles under the Mexican law in California and New Mexico up to the 13th of May , 1846 , and in Texas up to the 2d of March , 1836 . The former was the date of the declaration of war against Mexico and the latter that of the declaration of independence by Texas . The objection to the tenth article of the original treaty was not that it protected legitimate titles , which our laws would have equally protected without it , but that it most unjustly attempted to resuscitate grants which had become a mere nullity by allowing the grantees the same period after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty to which they had been originally entitled after the date of their grants for the purpose of performing the conditions on which they had been made . In submitting the treaty to the Senate I had recommended the rejection of this article . That portion of it in regard to lands in Texas did not receive a single vote in the Senate . This information was communicated by the letter of the Secretary of State to the minister for foreign affairs of Mexico , and was in possession of the Mexican Government during the whole period the treaty was before the Mexican Congress and the article itself was reprobated in that letter in the strongest terms . Besides , our commissioners to Mexico had been instructed that Neither the President nor the Senate of the United States can ever consent to ratify any treaty containing the tenth article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , in favor of grantees of land in Texas or elsewhere . And again Should the Mexican Government persist in retaining this article , then all prospect of immediate peace is ended and of this you may give them an absolute assurance . On this point the language of the protocol is free from ambiguity , but if it were otherwise is there any individual American or Mexican who would place such a construction upon it as to convert it into a vain attempt to revive this article , which had been so often and so solemnly condemned Surely no person could for one moment suppose that either the commissioners of the United States or the Mexican minister for foreign affairs ever entertained the purpose of thus setting at naught the deliberate decision of the President and Senate , which had been communicated to the Mexican Government with the assurance that their abandonment of this obnoxious article was essential to the restoration of peace . But the meaning of the protocol is plain . It is simply that the nullification of this article was not intended to destroy valid , legitimate titles to land which existed and were in full force independently of the provisions and without the aid of this article . Notwithstanding it has been expunged from the treaty , these grants were to preserve the legal value which they may possess . The refusal to revive grants which had become extinct was not to invalidate those which were in full force and vigor . That such was the clear understanding of the Senate of the United States , and this in perfect accordance with the protocol , is manifest from the fact that whilst they struck from the treaty this unjust article , they at the same time sanctioned and ratified the last paragraph of the eighth article of the treaty , which declares that In the said territories property of every kind now belonging to Mexicans not established there shall be inviolably respected . The present owners , the heirs of these , and all Mexicans who may hereafter acquire said property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it guaranties equally ample as if the same belonged to citizens of the United States . Without any stipulation in the treaty to this effect , all such valid titles under the Mexican Government would have been protected under the Constitution and laws of the United States . The third and last explanation contained in the protocol is that The Government of the United States , by suppressing the concluding paragraph of article 12 of the treaty , did not intend to deprive the Mexican Republic of the free and unrestrained faculty of ceding , conveying , or transferring at any time as it may judge best the sum of the 12 , 000 , 000 which the same Government of the United States is to deliver in the places designated by the amended article . The concluding paragraph of the original twelfth article , thus suppressed by the Senate , is in the following language Certificates in proper form for the said installments , respectively , in such sums as shall be desired by the Mexican Government , and transferable by it , shall be delivered to the said Government by that of the United States . From this bare statement of facts the meaning of the protocol is obvious . Although the Senate had declined to create a Government stock for the 12 , 000 , 000 , and issue transferable certificates for the amount in such sums as the Mexican Government might desire , yet they could not have intended thereby to deprive that Government of the faculty which every creditor possesses of transferring for his own benefit the obligation of his debtor , whatever this may be worth , according to his will and pleasure . It can not be doubted that the twelfth article of the treaty as it now stands contains a positive obligation , in consideration of the extension acquired by the boundaries of the United States , to pay to the Mexican Republic 12 , 000 , 000 in four equal annual installments of three millions each . This obligation may be assigned by the Mexican Government to any person whatever , but the assignee in such case would stand in no better condition than the Government . The amendment of the Senate prohibiting the issue of a Government transferable stock for the amount produces this effect and no more . The protocol contains nothing from which it can be inferred that the assignee could rightfully demand the payment of the money in case the consideration should fail , which is stated on the face of the obligation . With this view of the whole protocol , and considering that the explanations which it contained were in accordance with the treaty , I did not deem it necessary to take any action upon the subject . Had it varied from the terms of the treaty as amended by the Senate , although it would even then have been a nullity in itself , yet duty might have required that I should make this fact known to the Mexican Government . This not being the case , I treated it in the same manner I would have done had these explanations been made verbally by the commissioners to the Mexican minister for foreign affairs and communicated in a dispatch to the State Department .<speech_sep>
