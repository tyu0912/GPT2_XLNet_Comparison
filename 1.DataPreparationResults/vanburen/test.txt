Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives The act of the 23d of June , 1836 , regulating the deposits of the public money and directing the employment of State , District , and Territorial banks for that purpose , made it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to discontinue the use of such of them as should at any time refuse to redeem their notes in specie , and to substitute other banks , provided a sufficient number could be obtained to receive the public deposits upon the terms and conditions therein prescribed . The general and almost simultaneous suspension of specie payments by the banks in May last rendered the performance of this duty imperative in respect to those which had been selected under the act , and made it at the same time impracticable to employ the requisite number of others upon the prescribed conditions . The specific regulations established by Congress for the deposit and safe keeping of the public moneys having thus unexpectedly become inoperative , I felt it to be my duty to afford you an early opportunity for the exercise of your supervisory powers over the subject . I was also led to apprehend that the suspension of specie payments , increasing the embarrassments before existing in the pecuniary affairs of the country , would so far diminish the public revenue that the accruing receipts into the Treasury would not , with the reserved five millions , be sufficient to defray the unavoidable expenses of the Government until the usual period for the meeting of Congress , whilst the authority to call upon the States for a portion of the sums deposited with them was too restricted to enable the Department to realize a sufficient amount from that source . These apprehensions have been justified by subsequent results , which render it certain that this deficiency will occur if additional means be not provided by Congress . The difficulties experienced by the mercantile interest in meeting their engagements induced them to apply to me previously to the actual suspension of specie payments for indulgence upon their bonds for duties , and all the relief authorized by law was promptly and cheerfully granted . The dependence of the Treasury upon the avails of these bonds to enable it to make the deposits with the States required by law led me in the outset to limit this indulgence to the 1st of September , but it has since been extended to the 1st of October , that the matter might be submitted to your further direction . Questions were also expected to arise in the recess in respect to the October installment of those deposits requiring the interposition of Congress . A provision of another act , passed about the same time , and intended to secure a faithful compliance with the obligation of the United States to satisfy all demands upon them in specie or its equivalent , prohibited the offer of any bank note not convertible on the spot into gold or silver at the will of the holder and the ability of the Government , with millions on deposit , to meet its engagements in the manner thus required by law was rendered very doubtful by the event to which I have referred . Sensible that adequate provisions for these unexpected exigencies could only be made by Congress convinced that some of them would be indispensably necessary to the public service before the regular period of your meeting , and desirous also to enable you to exercise at the earliest moment your full constitutional powers for the relief of the country , I could not with propriety avoid subjecting you to the inconvenience of assembling at as early a day as the state of the popular representation would permit . I am sure that I have done but justice to your feelings in believing that this inconvenience will be cheerfully encountered in the hope of rendering your meeting conducive to the good of the country . During the earlier stages of the revulsion through which we have just passed much acrimonious discussion arose and great diversity of opinion existed as to its real causes . This was not surprising . The operations of credit are so diversified and the influences which affect them so numerous , and often so subtle , that even impartial and well informed persons are seldom found to agree in respect to them . To inherent difficulties were also added other tendencies which were by no means favorable to the discovery of truth . It was hardly to be expected that those who disapproved the policy of the Government in relation to the currency would , in the excited state of public feeling produced by the occasion , fail to attribute to that policy any extensive embarrassment in the monetary affairs of the country . The matter thus became connected with the passions and conflicts of party opinions were more or less affected by political considerations , and differences were prolonged which might otherwise have been determined by an appeal to facts , by the exercise of reason , or by mutual concession . It is , however , a cheering reflection that circumstances of this nature can not prevent a community so intelligent as ours from ultimately arriving at correct conclusions . Encouraged by the firm belief of this truth , I proceed to state my views , so far as may be necessary to a clear understanding of the remedies I feel it my duty to propose and of the reasons by which I have been led to recommend them . The history of trade in the United States for the last three or four years affords the most convincing evidence that our present condition is chiefly to be attributed to overaction in all the departments of business an over action deriving , perhaps , its first impulses from antecedent causes , but stimulated to its destructive consequences by excessive issues of bank paper and by other facilities for the acquisition and enlargement of credit . At the commencement of the year 1834 the banking capital of the United States , including that of the national bank , then existing , amounted to about 200 , 000 , 000 , the bank notes then in circulation to about ninety five millions , and the loans and discounts of the banks to three hundred and twenty four millions . Between that time and the 1st of January , 1836 , being the latest period to which accurate accounts have been received , our banking capital was increased to more than two hundred and fifty one millions , our paper circulation to more than one hundred and forty millions , and the loans and discounts to more than four hundred and fifty seven millions . To this vast increase are to be added the many millions of credit acquired by means of foreign loans , contracted by the States and State institutions , and , above all , by the lavish accommodations extended by foreign dealers to our merchants . The consequences of this redundancy of credit and of the spirit of reckless speculation engendered by it were a foreign debt contracted by our citizens estimated in March last at more than 30 , 000 , 000 the extension to traders in the interior of our country of credits for supplies greatly beyond the wants of the people the investment of 39 , 500 , 000 in unproductive public lands in the years 1835 and 1836 , whilst in the preceding year the sales amounted to only four and a half millions the creation of debts , to an almost countless amount , for real estate in existing or anticipated cities and villages , equally unproductive , and at prices now seen to have been greatly disproportionate to their real value the expenditure of immense sums in improvements which in many cases have been found to be ruinously improvident the diversion to other pursuits of much of the labor that should have been applied to agriculture , thereby contributing to the expenditure of large sums in the importation of grain from Europe an expenditure which , amounting in 1834 to about 250 , 000 , was in the first two quarters of the present year increased to more than 2 , 000 , 000 and finally , without enumerating other injurious results , the rapid growth among all classes , and especially in our great commercial towns , of luxurious habits founded too often on merely fancied wealth , and detrimental alike to the industry , the resources , and the morals of our people . It was so impossible that such a state of things could long continue that the prospect of revulsion was present to the minds of considerate men before it actually came . None , however , had correctly anticipated its severity . A concurrence of circumstances inadequate of themselves to produce such widespread and calamitous embarrassments tended so greatly to aggravate them that they can not be overlooked in considering their history . Among these may be mentioned , as most prominent , the great loss of capital sustained by our commercial emporium in the fire of December , 1835 a loss the effects of which were underrated at the time because postponed for a season by the great facilities of credit then existing the disturbing effects in our commercial cities of the transfers of the public moneys required by the deposit law of June , 1836 , and the measures adopted by the foreign creditors of our merchants to reduce their debts and to withdraw from the United States a large portion of our specie . However unwilling any of our citizens may heretofore have been to assign to these causes the chief instrumentality in producing the present state of things , the developments subsequently made and the actual condition of other commercial countries must , as it seems to me , dispel all remaining doubts upon the subject . It has since appeared that evils similar to those suffered by ourselves have been experienced in Great Britain , on the Continent , and , indeed , throughout the commercial world , and that in other countries as well as in our own they have been uniformly preceded by an undue enlargement of the boundaries of trade , prompted , as with us , by unprecedented expansions of the systems of credit . A reference to the amount of banking capital and the issues of paper credits put in circulation in Great Britain , by banks and in other ways , during the years 1834 , 1835 , and 1836 will show an augmentation of the paper currency there as much disproportioned to the real wants of trade as in the United States . With this redundancy of the paper currency there arose in that country also a spirit of adventurous speculation embracing the whole range of human enterprise . Aid was profusely given to projected improvements large investments were made in foreign stocks and loans credits for goods were granted with unbounded liberality to merchants in foreign countries , and all the means of acquiring and employing credit were put in active operation and extended in their effects to every department of business and to every quarter of the globe . The reaction was proportioned in its violence to the extraordinary character of the events which preceded it . The commercial community of Great Britain were subjected to the greatest difficulties , and their debtors in this country were not only suddenly deprived of accustomed and expected credits , but called upon for payments which in the actual posture of things here could only be made through a general pressure and at the most ruinous sacrifices . In view of these facts it would seem impossible for sincere inquirers after truth to resist the conviction that the causes of the revulsion in both countries have been substantially the same . Two nations , the most commercial in the world , enjoying but recently the highest degree of apparent prosperity and maintaining with each other the closest relations , are suddenly , in a time of profound peace and without any great national disaster , arrested in their career and plunged into a state of embarrassment and distress . In both countries we have witnessed the same redundancy of paper money and other facilities of credit the same spirit of speculation the same partial successes the same difficulties and reverses , and at length nearly the same overwhelming catastrophe . The most material difference between the results in the two countries has only been that with us there has also occurred an extensive derangement in the fiscal affairs of the Federal and State Governments , occasioned by the suspension of specie payments by the banks . The history of these causes and effects in Great Britain and the United States is substantially the history of the revulsion in all other commercial countries . The present and visible effects of these circumstances on the operations of the Government and on the industry of the people point out the objects which call for your immediate attention . They are , to regulate by law the safe keeping , transfer , and disbursement of the public moneys to designate the funds to be received and paid by the Government to enable the Treasury to meet promptly every demand upon it to prescribe the terms of indulgence and the mode of settlement to be adopted , as well in collecting from individuals the revenue that has accrued as in withdrawing it from former depositories and to devise and adopt such further measures , within the constitutional competency of Congress , as will be best calculated to revive the enterprise and to promote the prosperity of the country . For the deposit , transfer , and disbursement of the revenue national and State banks have always , with temporary and limited exceptions , been heretofore employed but although advocates of each system are still to be found , it is apparent that the events of the last few months have greatly augmented the desire , long existing among the people of the United States , to separate the fiscal operations of the Government from those of individuals or corporations . Again to create a national bank as a fiscal agent would be to disregard the popular will , twice solemnly and unequivocally expressed . On no question of domestic policy is there stronger evidence that the sentiments of a large majority are deliberately fixed , and I can not concur with those who think they see in recent events a proof that these sentiments are , or a reason that they should be , changed . Events similar in their origin and character have heretofore frequently occurred without producing any such change , and the lessons of experience must be forgotten if we suppose that the present overthrow of credit would have been prevented by the existence of a national bank . Proneness to excessive issues has ever been the vice of the banking system a vice as prominent in national as in State institutions . This propensity is as subservient to the advancement of private interests in the one as in the other , and those who direct them both , being principally guided by the same views and influenced by the same motives , will be equally ready to stimulate extravagance of enterprise by improvidence of credit . How strikingly is this conclusion sustained by experience The Bank of the United States , with the vast powers conferred on it by Congress , did not or could not prevent former and similar embarrassments , nor has the still greater strength it has been said to possess under its present charter enabled it in the existing emergency to check other institutions or even to save itself . In Great Britain , where it has been seen the same causes have been attended with the same effects , a national bank possessing powers far greater than are asked for by the warmest advocates of such an institution here has also proved unable to prevent an undue expansion of credit and the evils that flow from it . Nor can I find any tenable ground for the reestablishment of a national bank in the derangement alleged at present to exist in the domestic exchanges of the country or in the facilities it may be capable of affording them . Although advantages of this sort were anticipated when the first Bank of the United States was created , they were regarded as an incidental accommodation , not one which the Federal Government was bound or could be called upon to furnish . This accommodation is now , indeed , after the lapse of not many years , demanded from it as among its first duties , and an omission to aid and regulate commercial exchange is treated as a ground of loud and serious complaint . Such results only serve to exemplify the constant desire among some of our citizens to enlarge the powers of the Government and extend its control to subjects with which it should not interfere . They can never justify the creation of an institution to promote such objects . On the contrary , they justly excite among the community a more diligent inquiry into the character of those operations of trade toward which it is desired to extend such peculiar favors . The various transactions which bear the name of domestic exchanges differ essentially in their nature , operation , and utility . One class of them consists of bills of exchange drawn for the purpose of transferring actual capital from one part of the country to another , or to anticipate the proceeds of property actually transmitted . Bills of this description are highly useful in the movements of trade and well deserve all the encouragement which can rightfully be given to them . Another class is made up of bills of exchange not drawn to transfer actual capital nor on the credit of property transmitted , but to create fictitious capital , partaking at once of the character of notes discounted in bank and of bank notes in circulation , and swelling the mass of paper credits to a vast extent in the most objectionable manner . These bills have formed for the last few years a large proportion of what are termed the domestic exchanges of the country , serving as the means of usurious profit and constituting the most unsafe and precarious paper in circulation . This species of traffic , instead of being upheld , ought to be discountenanced by the Government and the people . In transferring its funds from place to place the Government is on the same footing with the private citizen and may resort to the same legal means . It may do so through the medium of bills drawn by itself or purchased from others and in these operations it may , in a manner undoubtedly constitutional and legitimate , facilitate and assist exchanges of individuals founded on real transactions of trade . The extent to which this may be done and the best means of effecting it are entitled to the fullest consideration . This has been bestowed by the Secretary of the Treasury , and his views will be submitted to you in his report . But it was not designed by the Constitution that the Government should assume the management of domestic or foreign exchange . It is indeed authorized to regulate by law the commerce between the States and to provide a general standard of value or medium of exchange in gold and silver , but it is not its province to aid individuals in the transfer of their funds otherwise than through the facilities afforded by the Post Office Department . As justly might it be called on to provide for the transportation of their merchandise . These are operations of trade . They ought to be conducted by those who are interested in them in the same manner that the incidental difficulties of other pursuits are encountered by other classes of citizens . Such aid has not been deemed necessary in other countries . Throughout Europe the domestic as well as the foreign exchanges are carried on by private houses , often , if not generally , without the assistance of banks yet they extend throughout distinct sovereignties , and far exceed in amount the real exchanges of the United States . There is no reason why our own may not be conducted in the same manner with equal cheapness and safety . Certainly this might be accomplished if it were favored by those most deeply interested and few can doubt that their own interest , as well as the general welfare of the country , would be promoted by leaving such a subject in the hands of those to whom it properly belongs . A system founded on private interest , enterprise , and competition , without the aid of legislative grants or regulations by law , would rapidly prosper it would be free from the influence of political agitation and extend the same exemption to trade itself , and it would put an end to those complaints of neglect , partiality , injustice , and oppression which are the unavoidable results of interference by the Government in the proper concerns of individuals . All former attempts on the part of the Government to carry its legislation in this respect further than was designed by the Constitution have in the end proved injurious , and have served only to convince the great body of the people more and more of the certain dangers of blending private interests with the operations of public business and there is no reason to suppose that a repetition of them now would be more successful . It can not be concealed that there exists in our community opinions and feelings on this subject in direct opposition to each other . A large portion of them , combining great intelligence , activity , and influence , are no doubt sincere in their belief that the operations of trade ought to be assisted by such a connection they regard a national bank as necessary for this purpose , and they are disinclined to every measure that does not tend sooner or later to the establishment of such an institution . On the other hand , a majority of the people are believed to be irreconcilably opposed to that measure they consider such a concentration of power dangerous to their liberties , and many of them regard it as a violation of the Constitution . This collision of opinion has doubtless caused much of the embarrassment to which the commercial transactions of the country have lately been exposed . Banking has become a political topic of the highest interest , and trade has suffered in the conflict of parties . A speedy termination of this state of things , however desirable , is scarcely to be expected . We have seen for nearly half a century that those who advocate a national bank , by whatever motive they may be influenced , constitute a portion of our community too numerous to allow us to hope for an early abandonment of their favorite plan . On the other hand , they must indeed form an erroneous estimate of the intelligence and temper of the American people who suppose that they have continued on slight or insufficient grounds their persevering opposition to such an institution , or that they can be induced by pecuniary pressure or by any other combination of circumstances to surrender principles they have so long and so inflexibly maintained My own views of the subject are unchanged . They have been repeatedly and unreservedly announced to my fellow citizens , who with full knowledge of them conferred upon me the two highest offices of the Government . On the last of these occasions I felt it due to the people to apprise them distinctly that in the event of my election I would not be able to cooperate in the reestablishment of a national bank . To these sentiments I have now only to add the expression of an increased conviction that the reestablishment of such a bank in any form , whilst it would not accomplish the beneficial purpose promised by its advocates , would impair the rightful supremacy of the popular will , injure the character and diminish the influence of our political system , and bring once more into existence a concentrated moneyed power , hostile to the spirit and threatening the permanency of our republican institutions . Local banks have been employed for the deposit and distribution of the revenue at all times partially and on three different occasions exclusively First , anterior to the establishment of the first Bank of the United States secondly , in the interval between the termination of that institution and the charter of its successor and thirdly , during the limited period which has now so abruptly closed . The connection thus repeatedly attempted proved unsatisfactory on each successive occasion , notwithstanding the various measures which were adopted to facilitate or insure its success . On the last occasion , in the year 1833 , the employment of the State banks was guarded especially , in every way which experience and caution could suggest . Personal security was required for the safe keeping and prompt payment of the moneys to be received , and full returns of their condition were from time to time to be made by the depositories . In the first stages the measure was eminently successful , notwithstanding the violent opposition of the Bank of the United States and the unceasing efforts made to overthrow it . The selected banks performed with fidelity and without any embarrassment to themselves or to the community their engagements to the Government , and the system promised to be permanently useful but when it became necessary , under the act of June , 1836 , to withdraw from them the public money for the purpose of placing it in additional institutions or of transferring it to the States , they found it in many cases inconvenient to comply with the demands of the Treasury , and numerous and pressing applications were made for indulgence or relief . As the installments under the deposit law became payable their own embarrassments and the necessity under which they lay of curtailing their discounts and calling in their debts increased the general distress and contributed , with other causes , to hasten the revulsion in which at length they , in common with the other banks , were fatally involved . Under these circumstances it becomes our solemn duty to inquire whether there are not in any connection between the Government and banks of issue evils of great magnitude , inherent in its very nature and against which no precautions can effectually guard . Unforeseen in the organization of the Government and forced on the Treasury by early necessities , the practice of employing banks was in truth from the beginning more a measure of emergency than of sound policy . When we started into existence as a nation , in addition to the burdens of the new Government we assumed all the large but honorable load of debt which was the price of our liberty but we hesitated to weigh down the infant industry of the country by resorting to adequate taxation for the necessary revenue . The facilities of banks , in return for the privileges they acquired , were promptly offered , and perhaps too readily received by an embarrassed Treasury . During the long continuance of a national debt and the intervening difficulties of a foreign war the connection was continued from motives of convenience but these causes have long since passed away . We have no emergencies that make banks necessary to aid the wants of the Treasury we have no load of national debt to provide for , and we have on actual deposit a large surplus . No public interest , therefore , now requires the renewal of a connection that circumstances have dissolved . The complete organization of our Government , the abundance of our resources , the general harmony which prevails between the different States and with foreign powers , all enable us now to select the system most consistent with the Constitution and most conducive to the public welfare . Should we , then , connect the Treasury for a fourth time with the local banks , it can only be under a conviction that past failures have arisen from accidental , not inherent , defects . A danger difficult , if not impossible , to be avoided in such an arrangement is made strikingly evident in the very event by which it has now been defeated . A sudden act of the banks intrusted with the funds of the people deprives the Treasury , without fault or agency of the Government , of the ability to pay its creditors in the currency they have by law a right to demand . This circumstance no fluctuation of commerce could have produced if the public revenue had been collected in the legal currency and kept in that form by the officers of the Treasury . The citizen whose money was in bank receives it back since the suspension at a sacrifice in its amount , whilst he who kept it in the legal currency of the country and in his own possession pursues without loss the current of his business . The Government , placed in the situation of the former , is involved in embarrassments it could not have suffered had it pursued the course of the latter . These embarrassments are , moreover , augmented by those salutary and just laws which forbid it to use a depreciated currency , and by so doing take from the Government the ability which individuals have of accommodating their transactions to such a catastrophe . A system which can in a time of profound peace , when there is a large revenue laid by , thus suddenly prevent the application and the use of the money of the people in the manner and for the objects they have directed can not be wise but who can think without painful reflection that under it the same unforeseen events might have befallen us in the midst of a war and taken from us at the moment when most wanted the use of those very means which were treasured up to promote the national welfare and guard our national rights To such embarrassments and to such dangers will this Government be always exposed whilst it takes the moneys raised for and necessary to the public service out of the hands of its own officers and converts them into a mere right of action against corporations intrusted with the possession of them . Nor can such results be effectually guarded against in such a system without investing the Executive with a control over the banks themselves , whether State or national , that might with reason be objected to . Ours is probably the only Government in the world that is liable in the management of its fiscal concerns to occurrences like these . But this imminent risk is not the only danger attendant on the surrender of the public money to the custody and control of local corporations . Though the object is aid to the Treasury , its effect may be to introduce into the operations of the Government influences the most subtle , founded on interests the most selfish . The use by the banks , for their own benefit , of the money deposited with them has received the sanction of the Government from the commencement of this connection . The money received from the people , instead of being kept till it is needed for their use , is , in consequence of this authority , a fund on which discounts are made for the profit of those who happen to be owners of stock in the banks selected as depositories . The supposed and often exaggerated advantages of such a boon will always cause it to be sought for with avidity . I will not stop to consider on whom the patronage incident to it is to be conferred . Whether the selection and control be trusted to Congress or to the Executive , either will be subjected to appeals made in every form which the sagacity of interest can suggest . The banks under such a system are stimulated to make the most of their fortunate acquisition the deposits are treated as an increase of capital loans and circulation are rashly augmented , and when the public exigencies require a return it is attended with embarrassments not provided for nor foreseen . Thus banks that thought themselves most fortunate when the public funds were received find themselves most embarrassed when the season of payment suddenly arrives . Unfortunately , too , the evils of the system are not limited to the banks . It stimulates a general rashness of enterprise and aggravates the fluctuations of commerce and the currency . This result was strikingly exhibited during the operations of the late deposit system , and especially in the purchases of public lands . The order which ultimately directed the payment of gold and silver in such purchases greatly checked , but could not altogether prevent , the evil . Specie was indeed more difficult to be procured than the notes which the banks could themselves create at pleasure but still , being obtained from them as a loan and returned as a deposit , which they were again at liberty to use , it only passed round the circle with diminished speed . This operation could not have been performed had the funds of the Government gone into the Treasury to be regularly disbursed , and not into banks to be loaned out for their own profit while they were permitted to substitute for it a credit in account . In expressing these sentiments I desire not to undervalue the benefits of a salutary credit to any branch of enterprise . The credit bestowed on probity and industry is the just reward of merit and an honorable incentive to further acquisition . None oppose it who love their country and understand its welfare . But when it is unduly encouraged when it is made to inflame the public mind with the temptations of sudden and unsubstantial wealth when it turns industry into paths that lead sooner or later to disappointment and distress , it becomes liable to censure and needs correction . Far from helping probity and industry , the ruin to which it leads falls most severely on the great laboring classes , who are thrown suddenly out of employment , and by the failure of magnificent schemes never intended to enrich them are deprived in a moment of their only resource . Abuses of credit and excesses in speculation will happen in despite of the most salutary laws no government , perhaps , can altogether prevent them , but surely every government can refrain from contributing the stimulus that calls them into life . Since , therefore , experience has shown that to lend the public money to the local banks is hazardous to the operations of the Government , at least of doubtful benefit to the institutions themselves , and productive of disastrous derangement in the business and currency of the country , is it the part of wisdom again to renew the connection It is true that such an agency is in many respects convenient to the Treasury , but it is not indispensable . A limitation of the expenses of the Government to its actual wants , and of the revenue to those expenses , with convenient means for its prompt application to the purposes for which it was raised , are the objects which we should seek to accomplish . The collection , safe keeping , transfer , and disbursement of the public money can , it is believed , be well managed by officers of the Government . Its collection , and to a great extent its disbursement also , have indeed been hitherto conducted solely by them , neither national nor State banks , when employed , being required to do more than keep it safely while in their custody , and transfer and pay it in such portions and at such times as the Treasury shall direct . Surely banks are not more able than the Government to secure the money in their possession against accident , violence , or fraud . The assertion that they are so must assume that a vault in a bank is stronger than a vault in the Treasury , and that directors , cashiers , and clerks not selected by the Government nor under its control are more worthy of confidence than officers selected from the people and responsible to the Government officers bound by official oaths and bonds for a faithful performance of their duties , and constantly subject to the supervision of Congress . The difficulties of transfer and the aid heretofore rendered by banks have been less than is usually supposed . The actual accounts show that by far the larger portion of payments is made within short or convenient distances from the places of collection and the whole number of warrants issued at the Treasury in the yeas 1834 a year the result of which will , it is believed , afford a safe test for the future fell short of 5 , 000 , or an average of less than 1 daily for each State in the city of New York they did not average more than 2 a day , and at the city of Washington only 4 . The difficulties heretofore existing are , moreover , daily lessened by an increase in the cheapness and facility of communication , and it may be asserted with confidence that the necessary transfers , as well as the safe keeping and disbursements of the public moneys , can be with safety and convenience accomplished through the agencies of Treasury officers . This opinion has been in some degree confirmed by actual experience since the discontinuance of the banks as fiscal agents in May last a period which from the embarrassments in commercial intercourse presented obstacles as great as any that may be hereafter apprehended . The manner of keeping the public money since that period is fully stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury . That officer also suggests the propriety of assigning by law certain additional duties to existing establishments and officers , which , with the modifications and safeguards referred to by him , will , he thinks , enable the Department to continue to perform this branch of the public service without any material addition either to their number or to the present expense . The extent of the business to be transacted has already been stated and in respect to the amount of money with which the officers employed would be intrusted at any one time , it appears that , assuming a balance of five millions to be at all times kept in the Treasury , and the whole of it left in the hands of the collectors and receivers , the proportion of each would not exceed an average of 30 , 000 but that , deducting one million for the use of the Mint and assuming the remaining four millions to be in the hands of one half of the present number of officers a supposition deemed more likely to correspond with the fact the sum in the hands of each would still be less than the amount of most of the bonds now taken from the receivers of public money . Every apprehension , however , on the subject , either in respect to the safety of the money or the faithful discharge of these fiscal transactions , may , it appears to me , be effectually removed by adding to the present means of the Treasury the establishment by law at a few important points of offices for the deposit and disbursement of such portions of the public revenue as can not with obvious safety and convenience be left in the possession of the collecting officers until paid over by them to the public creditors . Neither the amounts retained in their hands nor those deposited in the offices would in an ordinary condition of the revenue be larger in most cases than those often under the control of disbursing officers of the Army and Navy , and might be made entirely safe by requiring such securities and exercising such controlling supervision as Congress may by law prescribe . The principal officers whose appointments would become necessary under this plan , taking the largest number suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury , would not exceed ten , nor the additional expenses , at the same estimate , 60 , 000 a year . There can be no doubt of the obligation of those who are intrusted with the affairs of Government to conduct them with as little cost to the nation as is consistent with the public interest and it is for Congress , and ultimately for the people , to decide whether the benefits to be derived from keeping our fiscal concerns apart and severing the connection which has hitherto existed between the Government and banks offer sufficient advantages to justify the necessary expenses . If the object to be accomplished is deemed important to the future welfare of the country , I can not allow myself to believe that the addition to the public expenditure of comparatively so small an amount as will be necessary to effect it will be objected to by the people . It will be seen by the report of the Postmaster General herewith communicated that the fiscal affairs of that Department have been successfully conducted since May last upon the principle of dealing only in the legal currency of the United States , and that it needs no legislation to maintain its credit and facilitate the management of its concerns , the existing laws being , in the opinion of that officer , ample for those objects . Difficulties will doubtless be encountered for a season and increased services required from the public functionaries such are usually incident to the commencement of every system , but they will be greatly lessened in the progress of its operations . The power and influence supposed to be connected with the custody and disbursement of the public money are topics on which the public mind is naturally , and with great propriety , peculiarly sensitive . Much has been said on them in reference to the proposed separation of the Government from the banking institutions and surely no one can object to any appeals or animadversions on the subject which are consistent with facts and evince a proper respect for the intelligence of the people . If a Chief Magistrate may be allowed to speak for himself on such a point , I can truly say that to me nothing would be more acceptable than the withdrawal from the Executive , to the greatest practicable extent , of all concern in the custody and disbursement of the public revenue not that I would shrink from any responsibility cast upon me by the duties of my office , but because it is my firm belief that its capacity for usefulness is in no degree promoted by the possession of any patronage not actually necessary to the performance of those duties . But under our present form of government the intervention of the executive officers in the custody and disbursement of the public money seems to be unavoidable and before it can be admitted that the influence and power of the Executive would be increased by dispensing with the agency of banks the nature of that intervention in such an agency must be carefully regarded , and a comparison must be instituted between its extent in the two cases . The revenue can only be collected by officers appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate . The public moneys in the first instance must therefore in all cases pass through hands selected by the Executive . Other officers appointed in the same way , or , as in some cases , by the President alone , must also be intrusted with them when drawn for the purpose of disbursement . It is thus seen that even when banks are employed the public funds must twice pass through the hands of executive officers . Besides this , the head of the Treasury Department , who also holds office at the pleasure of the President , and some other officers of the same Department , must necessarily be invested with more or less power in the selection , continuance , and supervision of the banks that may be employed . The question is then narrowed to the single point whether in the intermediate stage between the collection and disbursement of the public money the agency of banks is necessary to avoid a dangerous extension of the patronage and influence of the Executive . But is it clear that the connection of the Executive with powerful moneyed institutions , capable of ministering to the interests of men in points where they are most accessible to corruption , is less liable to abuse than his constitutional agency in the appointment and control of the few public officers required by the proposed plan Will the public money when in their hands be necessarily exposed to any improper interference on the part of the Executive May it not be hoped that a prudent fear of public jealousy and disapprobation in a matter so peculiarly exposed to them will deter him from any such interference , even if higher motives be found inoperative May not Congress so regulate by law the duty of those officers and subject it to such supervision and publicity as to prevent the possibility of any serious abuse on the part of the Executive And is there equal room for such supervision and publicity in a connection with banks , acting under the shield of corporate immunities and conducted by persons irresponsible to the Government and the people It is believed that a considerate and candid investigation of these questions will result in the conviction that the proposed plan is far less liable to objection on the score of Executive patronage and control than any bank agency that has been or can be devised . With these views I leave to Congress the measures necessary to regulate in the present emergency the safe keeping and transfer of the public moneys . In the performance of constitutional duty I have stated to them without reserve the result of my own reflections . The subject is of great importance , and one on which we can scarcely expect to be as united in sentiment as we are in interest . It deserves a full and free discussion , and can not fail to be benefited by a dispassionate comparison of opinions . Well aware myself of the duty of reciprocal concession among the coordinate branches of the Government , I can promise a reasonable spirit of cooperation , so far as it can be indulged in without the surrender of constitutional objections which I believe to be well founded . Any system that may be adopted should be subjected to the fullest legal provision , so as to leave nothing to the Executive but what is necessary to the discharge of the duties imposed on him and whatever plan may be ultimately established , my own part shall be so discharged as to give to it a fair trial and the best prospect of success . The character of the funds to be received and disbursed in the transactions of the Government likewise demands your most careful consideration . There can be no doubt that those who framed and adopted the Constitution , having in immediate view the depreciated paper of the Confederacy of which 500 in paper were at times only equal to 1 in coin intended to prevent the recurrence of similar evils , so far at least as related to the transactions of the new Government . They gave to Congress express powers to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin they refused to give it power to establish corporations the agents then as now chiefly employed to create a paper currency they prohibited the States from making anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts and the First Congress directed by positive law that the revenue should be received in nothing but gold and silver . Public exigency at the outset of the Government , without direct legislative authority , led to the use of banks as fiscal aids to the Treasury . In admitted deviation from the law , at the same period and under the same exigency , the Secretary of the Treasury received their notes in payment of duties . The sole ground on which the practice thus commenced was then or has since been justified is the certain , immediate , and convenient exchange of such notes for specie . The Government did , indeed , receive the inconvertible notes of State banks during the difficulties of war , and the community submitted without a murmur to the unequal taxation and multiplied evils of which such a course was productive . With the war this indulgence ceased , and the banks were obliged again to redeem their notes in gold and silver . The Treasury , in accordance with previous practice , continued to dispense with the currency required by the act of 1789 , and took the notes of banks in full confidence of their being paid in specie on demand and Congress , to guard against the slightest violation of this principle , have declared by law that if notes are paid in the transactions of the Government it must be under such circumstances as to enable the holder to convert them into specie without depreciation or delay . Of my own duties under the existing laws , when the banks suspended specie payments , I could not doubt . Directions were immediately given to prevent the reception into the Treasury of anything but gold and silver , or its equivalent , and every practicable arrangement was made to preserve the public faith by similar or equivalent payments to the public creditors . The revenue from lands had been for some time substantially so collected under the order issued by directions of my predecessor . The effects of that order had been so salutary and its forecast in regard to the increasing insecurity of bank paper had become so apparent that even before the catastrophe I had resolved not to interfere with its operation . Congress is now to decide whether the revenue shall continue to be so collected or not . The receipt into the Treasury of bank notes not redeemed in specie on demand will not , I presume , be sanctioned . It would destroy without the excuse of war or public distress that equality of imposts and identity of commercial regulation which lie at the foundation of our Confederacy , and would offer to each State a direct temptation to increase its foreign trade by depreciating the currency received for duties in its ports . Such a proceeding would also in a great degree frustrate the policy so highly cherished of infusing into our circulation a larger proportion of the precious metals a policy the wisdom of which none can doubt , though there may be different opinions as to the extent to which it should be carried . Its results have been already too auspicious and its success is too closely interwoven with the future prosperity of the country to permit us for a moment to contemplate its abandonment . We have seen under its influence our specie augmented beyond eighty millions , our coinage increased so as to make that of gold amount , between August , 1834 , and December , 1836 , to 10 , 000 , 000 , exceeding the whole coinage at the Mint during the thirty one previous years . The prospect of further improvement continued without abatement until the moment of the suspension of specie payments . This policy has now , indeed , been suddenly checked , but is still far from being overthrown . Amidst all conflicting theories , one position is undeniable the precious metals will invariably disappear when there ceases to be a necessity for their use as a circulating medium . It was in strict accordance with this truth that whilst in the month of May last they were everywhere seen and were current for all ordinary purposes they disappeared from circulation the moment the payment of specie was refused by the banks and the community tacitly agreed to dispense with its employment . Their place was supplied by a currency exclusively of paper , and in many cases of the worst description . Already are the bank notes now in circulation greatly depreciated , and they fluctuate in value between one place and another , thus diminishing and making uncertain the worth of property and the price of labor , and failing to subserve , except at a heavy loss , the purposes of business . With each succeeding day the metallic currency decreases by some it is hoarded in the natural fear that once parted with it can not be replaced , while by others it is diverted from its more legitimate uses for the sake of gain . Should Congress sanction this condition of things by making irredeemable paper money receivable in payment of public dues , a temporary check to a wise and salutary policy will in all probability be converted into its absolute destruction . It is true that bank notes actually convertible into specie may be received in payment of the revenue without being liable to all these objections , and that such a course may to some extent promote individual convenience an object always to be considered where it does not conflict with the principles of our Government or the general welfare of the country . If such notes only were received , and always under circumstances allowing their early presentation for payment , and if at short and fixed periods they were converted into specie to be kept by the officers of the Treasury , some of the most serious obstacles to their reception would perhaps be removed . To retain the notes in the Treasury would be to renew under another form the loans of public money to the banks , and the evils consequent thereon . It is , however , a mistaken impression that any large amount of specie is required for public payments . Of the seventy or eighty millions now estimated to be in the country , ten millions would be abundantly sufficient for that purpose provided an accumulation of a large amount of revenue beyond the necessary wants of the Government be hereafter prevented . If to these considerations be added the facilities which will arise from enabling the Treasury to satisfy the public creditors by its drafts or notes receivable in payment of the public dues , it may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizen requires the reception of bank paper . To say that the refusal of paper money by the Government introduces an unjust discrimination between the currency received by it and that used by individuals in their ordinary affairs is , in my judgment , to view it in a very erroneous light . The Constitution prohibits the States from making anything but gold and silver a tender in the payment of debts , and thus secures to every citizen a right to demand payment in the legal currency . To provide by law that the Government will only receive its dues in gold and silver is not to confer on it any peculiar privilege , but merely to place it on an equality with the citizen by reserving to it a right secured to him by the Constitution . It is doubtless for this reason that the principle has been sanctioned by successive laws from the time of the first Congress under the Constitution down to the last . Such precedents , never objected to and proceeding from such sources , afford a decisive answer to the imputation of inequality or injustice . But in fact the measure is one of restriction , not of favor . To forbid the public agent to receive in payment any other than a certain kind of money is to refuse him a discretion possessed by every citizen . It may be left to those who have the management of their own transactions to make their own terms , but no such discretion should be given to him who acts merely as an agent of the people who is to collect what the law requires and to pay the appropriations it makes . When bank notes are redeemed on demand , there is then no discrimination in reality , for the individual who receives them may at his option substitute the specie for them he takes them from convenience or choice . When they are not so redeemed , it will scarcely be contended that their receipt and payment by a public officer should be permitted , though none deny that right to an individual if it were , the effect would be most injurious to the public , since their officer could make none of those arrangements to meet or guard against the depreciation which an individual is at liberty to do . Nor can inconvenience to the community be alleged as an objection to such a regulation . Its object and motive are their convenience and welfare . If at a moment of simultaneous and unexpected suspension by the banks it adds something to the many embarrassments of that proceeding , yet these are far overbalanced by its direct tendency to produce a wider circulation of gold and silver , to increase the safety of bank paper , to improve the general currency , and thus to prevent altogether such occurrences and the other and far greater evils that attend them . It may indeed be questioned whether it is not for the interest of the banks themselves that the Government should not receive their paper . They would be conducted with more caution and on sounder principles . By using specie only in its transactions the Government would create a demand for it , which would to a great extent prevent its exportation , and by keeping it in circulation maintain a broader and safer basis for the paper currency . That the banks would thus be rendered more sound and the community more safe can not admit of a doubt . The foregoing views , it seems to me , do but fairly carry out the provisions of the Federal Constitution in relation to the currency , as far as relates to the public revenue . At the time that instrument was framed there were but three or four banks in the United States , and had the extension of the banking system and the evils growing out of it been foreseen they would probably have been specially guarded against . The same policy which led to the prohibition of bills of credit by the States would doubtless in that event have also interdicted their issue as a currency in any other form . The Constitution , however , contains no such prohibition and since the States have exercised for nearly half a century the power to regulate the business of banking , it is not to be expected that it will be abandoned . The whole matter is now under discussion before the proper tribunal the people of the States . Never before has the public mind been so thoroughly awakened to a proper sense of its importance never has the subject in all its bearings been submitted to so searching an inquiry . It would be distrusting the intelligence and virtue of the people to doubt the speedy and efficient adoption of such measures of reform as the public good demands . All that can rightfully be done by the Federal Government to promote the accomplishment of that important object will without doubt be performed . In the meantime it is our duty to provide all the remedies against a depreciated paper currency which the Constitution enables us to afford . The Treasury Department on several former occasions has suggested the propriety and importance of a uniform law concerning bankruptcies of corporations and other bankers . Through the instrumentality of such a law a salutary check may doubtless be imposed on the issues of paper money and an effectual remedy given to the citizen in a way at once equal in all parts of the Union and fully authorized by the Constitution . The indulgence granted by Executive authority in the payment of bonds for duties has been already mentioned . Seeing that the immediate enforcement of these obligations would subject a large and highly respectable portion of our citizens to great sacrifices , and believing that a temporary postponement could be made without detriment to other interests and with increased certainty of ultimate payment , I did not hesitate to comply with the request that was made of me . The terms allowed are to the full extent as liberal as any that are to be found in the practice of the executive department . It remains for Congress to decide whether a further postponement may not with propriety be allowed and if so , their legislation upon the subject is respectfully invited . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit the condition of these debts , the extent and effect of the present indulgence , the probable result of its further extension on the state of the Treasury , and every other fact necessary to a full consideration of the subject . Similar information is communicated in regard to such depositories of the public moneys as are indebted to the Government , in order that Congress may also adopt the proper measures in regard to them . The receipts and expenditures for the first half of the year and an estimate of those for the residue will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury . In his report of December last it was estimated that the current receipts would fall short of the expenditures by about 3 , 000 , 000 . It will be seen that the difference will be much greater . This is to be attributed not only to the occurrence of greater pecuniary embarrassments in the business of the country than those which were then predicted , and consequently a greater diminution in the revenue , but also to the fact that the appropriations exceeded by nearly six millions the amount which was asked for in the estimates then submitted . The sum necessary for the service of the year , beyond the probable receipts and the amount which it was intended should be reserved in the Treasury at the commencement of the year , will be about six millions . If the whole of the reserved balance be not at once applied to the current expenditures , but four millions be still kept in the Treasury , as seems most expedient for the uses of the Mint and to meet contingencies , the sum needed will be ten millions . In making this estimate the receipts are calculated on the supposition of some further extension of the indulgence granted in the payment of bonds for duties , which will affect the amount of the revenue for the present year to the extent of two and a half millions . It is not proposed to procure the required amount by loans or increased taxation . There are now in the Treasury 9 , 367 , 214 , directed by the act of the 23d of June , 1836 , to be deposited with the States in October next . This sum , if so deposited , will be subject under the law to be recalled if needed to defray existing appropriations and as it is now evident that the whole , or the principal part , of it will be wanted for that purpose , it appears most proper that the deposit should be withheld . Until the amount can be collected from the banks , Treasury notes may be temporarily issued , to be gradually redeemed as it is received . I am aware that this course may be productive of inconvenience to many of the States . Relying upon the acts of Congress which held out to them the strong probability , if not the certainty , of receiving this installment , they have in some instances adopted measures with which its retention may seriously interfere . That such a condition of things should have occurred is much to be regretted . It is not the least among the unfortunate results of the disasters of the times and it is for Congress to devise a fit remedy , if there be one . The money being indispensable to the wants of the Treasury , it is difficult to conceive upon what principle of justice or expediency its application to that object can be avoided . To recall any portion of the sums already deposited with the States would be more inconvenient and less efficient . To burden the country with increased taxation when there is in fact a large surplus revenue would be unjust and unwise to raise moneys by loans under such circumstances , and thus to commence a new national debt , would scarcely be sanctioned by the American people . The plan proposed will be adequate to all our fiscal operations during the remainder of the year . Should it be adopted , the Treasury , aided by the ample resources of the country , will be able to discharge punctually every pecuniary obligation . For the future all that is needed will be that caution and forbearance in appropriations which the diminution of the revenue requires and which the complete accomplishment or great forwardness of many expensive national undertakings renders equally consistent with prudence and patriotic liberality . The preceding suggestions and recommendations are submitted in the belief that their adoption by Congress will enable the executive department to conduct our fiscal concerns with success so far as their management has been committed to it . Whilst the objects and the means proposed to attain them are within its constitutional powers and appropriate duties , they will at the same time , it is hoped , by their necessary operation , afford essential aid in the transaction of individual concerns , and thus yield relief to the people at large in a form adapted to the nature of our Government . Those who look to the action of this Government for specific aid to the citizen to relieve embarrassments arising from losses by revulsion in commerce and credit lose sight of the ends for which it was created and the powers with which it is clothed . It was established to give security to us all in our lawful and honorable pursuits , under the lasting safeguard of republican institutions . It was not intended to confer special favors on individuals or on any classes of them , to create systems of agriculture , manufactures , or trade , or to engage in them either separately or in connection with individual citizens or organized associations . If its operations were to be directed for the benefit of any one class , equivalent favors must in justice be extended to the rest , and the attempt to bestow such favors with an equal hand , or even to select those who should most deserve them , would never be successful . All communities are apt to look to government for too much . Even in our own country , where its powers and duties are so strictly limited , we are prone to do so , especially at periods of sudden embarrassment and distress . But this ought not to be . The framers of our excellent Constitution and the people who approved it with calm and sagacious deliberation acted at the time on a sounder principle . They wisely judged that the less government interferes with private pursuits the better for the general prosperity . It is not its legitimate object to make men rich or to repair by direct grants of money or legislation in favor of particular pursuits losses not incurred in the public service . This would be substantially to use the property of some for the benefit of others . But its real duty that duty the performance of which makes a good government the most precious of human blessings is to enact and enforce a system of general laws commensurate with , but not exceeding , the objects of its establishment , and to leave every citizen and every interest to reap under its benign protection the rewards of virtue , industry , and prudence . I can not doubt that on this as on all similar occasions the Federal Government will find its agency most conducive to the security and happiness of the people when limited to the exercise of its conceded powers . In never assuming , even for a well meant object , such powers as were not designed to be conferred upon it , we shall in reality do most for the general welfare . To avoid every unnecessary intereference with the pursuits of the citizen will result in more benefit than to adopt measures which could only assist limited interests , and are eagerly , but perhaps naturally , sought for under the pressure of temporary circumstances . If , therefore , I refrain from suggesting to Congress any specific plan for regulating the exchanges of the country , relieving mercantile embarrassments , or interfering with the ordinary operations of foreign or domestic commerce , it is from a conviction that such measures are not within the constitutional provinces of the General Government , and that their adoption would not promote the real and permanent welfare of those they might be designed to aid . The difficulties and distresses of the times , though unquestionably great , are limited in their extent , and can not be regarded as affecting the permanent prosperity of the nation . Arising in a great degree from the transactions of foreign and domestic commerce , it is upon them that they have chiefly fallen . The great agricultural interest has in many parts of the country suffered comparatively little , and , as if Providence intended to display the munifence of its goodness at the moment of our greatest need , and in direct contrast to the evils occasioned by the waywardness of man , we have been blessed throughout our extended territory with a season of general health and of uncommon fruitfulness . The proceeds of our great staples will soon furnish the means of liquidating debts at home and abroad , and contribute equally to the revival of commercial activity and the restoration of commercial credit . The banks , established avowedly for its support , deriving their profits from it , and resting under obligations to it which can not be overlooked , will feel at once the necessity and justice of uniting their energies with those of the mercantile interest . The suspension of specie payments at such a time and under such circumstances as we have lately witnessed could not be other than a temporary measure , and we can scarcely err in believing that the period must soon arrive when all that are solvent will redeem their issues in gold and silver . Dealings abroad naturally depend on resources and prosperity at home . If the debt of our merchants has accumulated or their credit is impaired , these are fluctuations always incident to extensive or extravagant mercantile transactions . But the ultimate security of such obligations does not admit of question . They are guaranteed by the resources of a country the fruits of whose indutry afford abundant means of ample liquidation , and by the evident interest of every merchant to sustain a credit hitherto high by promptly applying these means for its preservation . I deeply regret that events have occurred which require me to ask your consideration of such serious topics . I could have wished that in making my first communication to the assembled representatives of my country I had nothing to dwell upon but the history of her unalloyed prosperity . Since it is otherwise , we can only feel more deeply the responsibility of the respective trusts that have been confided to us , and under the pressure of difficulties unite in invoking the guidance and aid of the Supreme Ruler of Nations and in laboring with zealous resolution to overcome the difficulties by which we are environed . It is under such circumstances a high gratification to know by long experience that we act for a people to whom the truth , however unpromising , can always be spoken with safety for the trial of whose patriotism no emergency is too severe , and who are sure never to desert a public functionary honestly laboring for the public good . It seems just that they should receive without delay any aid in their embarrassments which your deliberations can afford . Coming directly from the midst of them , and knowing the course of events in every section of our country , from you may best be learnt as well the extent and nature of these embarrassments as the most desirable measures of relief . I am aware , however , that it is not proper to detain you at present longer than may be demanded by the special objects for which you are convened . To them , therefore , I have confined my communication and believing it will not be your own wish now to extend your deliberations beyond them , I reserve till the usual period of your annual meeting that general information on the state of the Union which the Constitution requires me to give . VAN BUREN<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives I regret that I can not on this occasion congratulate you that the past year has been one of unalloyed prosperity . The ravages of fire and disease have painfully afflicted otherwise flourishing portions of our country , and serious embarrassments yet derange the trade of many of our cities . But notwithstanding these adverse circumstances , that general prosperity which has been heretofore so bountifully bestowed upon us by the Author of All Good still continues to call for our warmest gratitude . Especially have we reason to rejoice in the exuberant harvests which have lavishly recompensed well directed industry and given to it that sure reward which is vainly sought in visionary speculations . I cannot , indeed , view without peculiar satisfaction the evidences afforded by the past season of the benefits that spring from the steady devotion of the husbandman to his honorable pursuit . No means of individual comfort is more certain and no source of national prosperity is so sure . Nothing can compensate a people for a dependence upon others for the bread they eat , and that cheerful abundance on which the happiness of everyone so much depends is to be looked for nowhere with such sure reliance as in the industry of the agriculturist and the bounties of the earth . With foreign countries our relations exhibit the same favorable aspect which was presented in my last annual message , and afford continued proof of the wisdom of the pacific , just , and forbearing policy adopted by the first Administration of the Federal Government and pursued by its successors . The extraordinary powers vested in me by an act of Congress for the defense of the country in an emergency , considered so far probable as to require that the Executive should possess ample means to meet it , have not been exerted . They have therefore been attended with no other result than to increase , by the confidence thus reposed in me , my obligations to maintain with religious exactness the cardinal principles that govern our intercourse with other nations . Happily , in our pending questions with Great Britain , out of which this unusual grant of authority arose , nothing has occurred to require its exertion , and as it is about to return to the Legislature I trust that no future necessity may call for its exercise by them or its delegation to another Department of the Government . For the settlement of our northeastern boundary the proposition promised by Great Britain for a commission of exploration and survey has been received , and a counter project , including also a provision for the certain and final adjustment of the limits in dispute , is now before the British Government for its consideration . A just regard to the delicate state of this question and a proper respect for the natural impatience of the State of Maine , not less than a conviction that the negotiation has been already protracted longer than is prudent on the part of either Government , have led me to believe that the present favorable moment should on no account be suffered to pass without putting the question forever at rest . I feel confident that the Government of Her Britannic Majesty will take the same view of this subject , as I am persuaded it is governed by desires equally strong and sincere for the amicable termination of the controversy . To the intrinsic difficulties of questions of boundary lines , especially those described in regions unoccupied and but partially known , is to be added in our country the embarrassment necessarily arising out of our Constitution by which the General Government is made the organ of negotiating and deciding upon the particular interests of the States on whose frontiers these lines are to be traced . To avoid another controversy in which a State government might rightfully claim to have her wishes consulted previously to the conclusion of conventional arrangements concerning her rights of jurisdiction or territory , I have thought it necessary to call the attention of the Government of Great Britain to another portion of our conterminous dominion of which the division still remains to be adjusted I refer to the line from the entrance of Lake Superior to the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods , stipulations for the settlement of which are to be found in the seventh article of the treaty of Ghent . The commissioners appointed under that article by the two Governments having differed in their opinions , made separate reports , according to its stipulations , upon the points of disagreement , and these differences are now to be submitted to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign or state . The disputed points should be settled and the line designated before the Territorial government of which it is one of the boundaries takes its place in the Union as a State , and I rely upon the cordial cooperation of the British Government to effect that object . There is every reason to believe that disturbances like those which lately agitated the neighboring British Provinces will not again prove the sources of border contentions or interpose obstacles to the continuance of that good understanding which it is the mutual interest of Great Britain and the United States to preserve and maintain . Within the Provinces themselves tranquillity is restored , and on our frontier that misguided sympathy in favor of what was presumed to be a general effort in behalf of popular rights , and which in some instances misled a few of our more inexperienced citizens , has subsided into a rational conviction strongly opposed to all intermeddling with the internal affairs of our neighbors . The people of the United States feel , as it is hoped they always will , a warm solicitude for the success of all who are sincerely endeavoring to improve the political condition of mankind . This generous feeling they cherish toward the most distant nations , and it was natural , therefore , that it should be awakened with more than common warmth in behalf of their immediate neighbors but it does not belong to their character as a community to seek the gratification of those feelings in acts which violate their duty as citizens , endanger the peace of their country , and tend to bring upon it the stain of a violated faith toward foreign nations . If , zealous to confer benefits on others , they appear for a moment to lose sight of the permanent obligations imposed upon them as citizens , they are seldom long misled . From all the information I receive , confirmed to some extent by personal observation , I am satisfied that no one can now hope to engage in such enterprises without encountering public indignation , in addition to the severest penalties of the law . Recent information also leads me to hope that the emigrants from Her Majesty s Provinces who have sought refuge within our boundaries are disposed to become peaceable residents and to abstain from all attempts to endanger the peace of that country which has afforded them an asylum . On a review of the occurrences on both sides of the line it is satisfactory to reflect that in almost every complaint against our country the offense may be traced to emigrants from the Provinces who have sought refuge here . In the few instances in which they were aided by citizens of the United States the acts of these misguided men were not only in direct contravention of the laws and well known wishes of their own Government , but met with the decided disapprobation of the people of the United States . I regret to state the appearance of a different spirit among Her Majesty s subjects in the Canadas . The sentiments of hostility to our people and institutions which have been so frequently expressed there , and the disregard of our rights which has been manifested on some occasions , have , I am sorry to say , been applauded and encouraged by the people , and even by some of the subordinate local authorities , of the Provinces . The chief officers in Canada , fortunately , have not entertained the same feeling , and have probably prevented excesses that must have been fatal to the peace of the two countries . I look forward anxiously to a period when all the transactions which have grown out of this condition of our affairs , and which have been made the subjects of complaint and remonstrance by the two Governments , respectively , shall be fully examined , and the proper satisfaction given where it is due from either side . Nothing has occurred to disturb the harmony of our intercourse with Austria , Belgium , Denmark , France , Naples , Portugal , Prussia , Russia , or Sweden . The internal state of Spain has sensibly improved , and a well grounded hope exists that the return of peace will restore to the people of that country their former prosperity and enable the Government to fulfill all its obligations at home and abroad . The Government of Portugal , I have the satisfaction to state , has paid in full the eleventh and last installment due to our citizens for the claims embraced in the settlement made with it on the 3d of March , 1837 . I lay before you treaties of commerce negotiated with the Kings of Sardinia and of the Netherlands , the ratifications of which have been exchanged since the adjournment of Congress . The liberal principles of these treaties will recommend them to your approbation . That with Sardinia is the first treaty of commerce formed by that Kingdom , and it will , I trust , answer the expectations of the present Sovereign by aiding the development of the resources of his country and stimulating the enterprise of his people . That with the Netherlands happily terminates a long existing subject of dispute and removes from our future commercial intercourse all apprehension of embarrassment . The King of the Netherlands has also , in further illustration of his character for justice and of his desire to remove every cause of dissatisfaction , made compensation for an American vessel captured in 1800 by a French privateer , and carried into Curacoa , where the proceeds were appropriated to the use of the colony , then , and for a short time after , under the dominion of Holland . The death of the late Sultan has produced no alteration in our relations with Turkey . Our newly appointed minister resident has reached Constantinople , and I have received assurances from the present ruler that the obligations of our treaty and those of friendship will be fulfilled by himself in the same spirit that actuated his illustrious father . I regret to be obliged to inform you that no convention for the settlement of the claims of our citizens upon Mexico has yet been ratified by the Government of that country . The first convention formed for that purpose was not presented by the President of Mexico for the approbation of its Congress , from a belief that the King of Prussia , the arbitrator in case of disagreement in the joint commission to be appointed by the United States and Mexico , would not consent to take upon himself that friendly office . Although not entirely satisfied with the course pursued by Mexico , I felt no hesitation in receiving in the most conciliatory spirit the explanation offered , and also cheerfully consented to a new convention , in order to arrange the payments proposed to be made to our citizens in a manner which , while equally just to them , was deemed less onerous and inconvenient to the Mexican Government . Relying confidently upon the intentions of that Government , Ellis was directed to repair to Mexico , and diplomatic intercourse has been resumed between the two countries . The new convention has , he informs us , been recently submitted by the President of that Republic to its Congress under circumstances which promise a speedy ratification , a result which I can not allow myself to doubt . Instructions have been given to the commissioner of the United States under our convention with Texas for the demarcation of the line which separates us from that Republic . The commissioners of both Governments met in New Orleans in August last . The joint commission was organized , and adjourned to convene at the same place on the 12th of October . It is presumed to be now in the performance of its duties . The new Government of Texas has shown its desire to cultivate friendly relations with us by a prompt reparation for injuries complained of in the cases of two vessels of the United States . With Central America a convention has been concluded for the renewal of its former treaty with the United States . This was not ratified before the departure of our late charge d affaires from that country , and the copy of it brought by him was not received before the adjournment of the Senate at the last session . In the meanwhile , the period limited for the exchange of ratifications having expired , I deemed it expedient , in consequence of the death of the charge d affaires , to send a special agent to Central America to close the affairs of our mission there and to arrange with the Government an extension of the time for the exchange of ratifications . The commission created by the States which formerly composed the Republic of Colombia for adjusting the claims against that Government has by a very unexpected construction of the treaty under which it acts decided that no provision was made for those claims of citizens of the United States which arose from captures by Colombian privateers and were adjudged against the claimants in the judicial tribunals . This decision will compel the United States to apply to the several Governments formerly united for redress . With all these New Granada , Venezuela , and Ecuador a perfectly good understanding exists . Our treaty with Venezuela is faithfully carried into execution , and that country , in the enjoyment of tranquillity , is gradually advancing in prosperity under the guidance of its present distinguished President , General Paez . With Ecuador a liberal commercial convention has lately been concluded , which will be transmitted to the Senate at an early day . With the great American Empire of Brazil our relations continue unchanged , as does our friendly intercourse with the other Governments of South America the Argentine Republic and the Republics of Uruguay , Chili , Peru , and Bolivia . The dissolution of the Peru Bolivian Confederation may occasion some temporary inconvenience to our citizens in that quarter , but the obligations on the new Governments which have arisen out of that Confederation to observe its treaty stipulations will no doubt be soon understood , and it is presumed that no indisposition will exist to fulfill those which it contracted with the United States . The financial operations of the Government during the present year have , I am happy to say , been very successful . The difficulties under which the Treasury Department has labored , from known defects in the existing laws relative to the safe keeping of the public moneys , aggravated by the suspension of specie payments by several of the banks holding public deposits or indebted to public officers for notes received in payment of public dues , have been surmounted to a very gratifying extent . The large current expenditures have been punctually met , and the faith of the Government in all its pecuniary concerns has been scrupulously maintained . The nineteen millions of Treasury notes authorized by the act of Congress of 1837 , and the modifications thereof with a view to the indulgence of merchants on their duty bonds and of the deposit banks in the payment of public moneys held by them , have been so punctually redeemed as to leave less than the original ten millions outstanding at any one time , and the whole amount unredeemed now falls short of three millions . Of these the chief portion is not due till next year , and the whole would have been already extinguished could the Treasury have realized the payments due to it from the banks . If those due from them during the next year shall be punctually made , and if Congress shall keep the appropriations within the estimates , there is every reason to believe that all the outstanding Treasury notes can be redeemed and the ordinary expenses defrayed without imposing on the people any additional burden , either of loans or increased taxes . To avoid this and to keep the expenditures within reasonable bounds is a duty second only in importance to the preservation of our national character and the protection of our citizens in their civil and political rights . The creation in time of peace of a debt likely to become permanent is an evil for which there is no equivalent . The rapidity with which many of the States are apparently approaching to this condition admonishes us of our own duties in a manner too impressive to be disregarded . One , not the least important , is to keep the Federal Government always in a condition to discharge with ease and vigor its highest functions should their exercise be required by any sudden conjuncture of public affairs a condition to which we are always exposed and which may occur when it is least expected . To this end it is indispensable that its finances should be untrammeled and its resources as far as practicable unencumbered . No circumstance could present greater obstacles to the accomplishment of these vitally important objects than the creation of an onerous national debt . Our own experience and also that of other nations have demonstrated the unavoidable and fearful rapidity with which a public debt is increased when the Government has once surrendered itself to the ruinous practice of supplying its supposed necessities by new loans . The struggle , therefore , on our part to be successful must be made at the threshold . To make our efforts effective , severe economy is necessary . This is the surest provision for the national welfare , and it is at the same time the best preservative of the principles on which our institutions rest . Simplicity and economy in the affairs of state have never failed to chasten and invigorate republican principles , while these have been as surely subverted by national prodigality , under whatever specious pretexts it may have been introduced or fostered . These considerations can not be lost upon a people who have never been inattentive to the effect of their policy upon the institutions they have created for themselves , but at the present moment their force is augmented by the necessity which a decreasing revenue must impose . The check lately given to importations of articles subject to duties , the derangements in the operations of internal trade , and especially the reduction gradually taking place in our tariff of duties , all tend materially to lessen our receipts indeed , it is probable that the diminution resulting from the last cause alone will not fall short of 5 , 000 , 000 in the year 1842 , as the final reduction of all duties to 20 per cent then takes effect . The whole revenue then accruing from the customs and from the sales of public lands , if not more , will undoubtedly be wanted to defray the necessary expenses of the Government under the most prudent administration of its affairs . These are circumstances that impose the necessity of rigid economy and require its prompt and constant exercise . With the Legislature rest the power and duty of so adjusting the public expenditure as to promote this end . By the provisions of the Constitution it is only in consequence of appropriations made by law that money can be drawn from the Treasury . No instance has occurred since the establishment of the Government in which the Executive , though a component part of the legislative power , has interposed an objection to an appropriation bill on the sole ground of its extravagance . His duty in this respect has been considered fulfilled by requesting such appropriations only as the public service may be reasonably expected to require . In the present earnest direction of the public mind toward this subject both the Executive and the Legislature have evidence of the strict responsibility to which they will be held and while I am conscious of my own anxious efforts to perform with fidelity this portion of my public functions , it is a satisfaction to me to be able to count on a cordial cooperation from you . At the time I entered upon my present duties our ordinary disbursements , without including those on account of the public debt , the Post Office , and the trust funds in charge of the Government , had been largely increased by appropriations for the removal of the Indians , for repelling Indian hostilities , and for other less urgent expenses which grew out of an overflowing Treasury . Independent of the redemption of the public debt and trusts , the gross expenditures of seventeen and eighteen millions in 1834 and 1835 had by these causes swelled to twenty nine millions in 1836 , and the appropriations for 1837 , made previously to the 4th of March , caused the expenditure to rise to the very large amount of thirty three millions . We were enabled during the year 1838 , notwithstanding the continuance of our Indian embarrassments , somewhat to reduce this amount , and that for the present year 1839 will not in all probability exceed twenty six millions , or six millions less than it was last year . With a determination , so far as depends on me , to continue this reduction , I have directed the estimates for 1840 to be subjected to the severest scrutiny and to be limited to the absolute requirements of the public service . They will be found less than the expenditures of 1839 by over 5 , 000 , 000 . The precautionary measures which will be recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury to protect faithfully the public credit under the fluctuations and contingencies to which our receipts and expenditures are exposed , and especially in a commercial crisis like the present , are commended to your early attention . On a former occasion your attention was invited to various considerations in support of a preemption law in behalf of the settlers on the public lands , and also of a law graduating the prices for such lands as had long been in the market unsold in consequence of their inferior quality . The execution of the act which was passed on the first subject has been attended with the happiest consequences in quieting titles and securing improvements to the industrious , and it has also to a very gratifying extent been exempt from the frauds which were practiced under previous preemption laws . It has at the same time , as was anticipated , contributed liberally during the present year to the receipts of the Treasury . The passage of a graduation law , with the guards before recommended , would also , I am persuaded , add considerably to the revenue for several years , and prove in other respects just and beneficial . Your early consideration of the subject is therefore once more earnestly requested . The present condition of the defenses of our principal seaports and navy yards , as represented by the accompanying report of the Secretary of War , calls for the early and serious attention of Congress and , as connecting itself intimately with this subject , I can not recommend too strongly to your consideration the plan submitted by that officer for the organization of the militia of the United States . In conformity with the expressed wishes of Congress , an attempt was made in the spring to terminate the Florida war by negotiation . It is to be regretted that these humane intentions should have been frustrated and that the effort to bring these unhappy difficulties to a satisfactory conclusion should have failed but after entering into solemn engagements with the commanding general , the Indians , without any provocation , recommenced their acts of treachery and murder . The renewal of hostilities in that Territory renders it necessary that I should recommend to your favorable consideration the plan which will be submitted to you by the Secretary of War , in order to enable that Department to conduct them to a successful issue . Having had an opportunity of personally inspecting a portion of the troops during the last summer , it gives me pleasure to bear testimony to the success of the effort to improve their discipline by keeping them together in as large bodies as the nature of our service will permit . I recommend , therefore , that commodious and permanent barracks be constructed at the several posts designated by the Secretary of War . Notwithstanding the high state of their discipline and excellent police , the evils resulting to the service from the deficiency of company officers were very apparent , and I recommend that the staff officers be permanently separated from the line . The Navy has been usefully and honorably employed in protecting the rights and property of our citizens wherever the condition of affairs seemed to require its presence . With the exception of one instance , where an outrage , accompanied by murder , was committed on a vessel of the United States while engaged in a lawful commerce , nothing is known to have occurred to impede or molest the enterprise of our citizens on that element , where it is so signally displayed . On learning this daring act of piracy , Commodore Reed proceeded immediately to the spot , and receiving no satisfaction , either in the surrender of the murderers or the restoration of the plundered property , inflicted severe and merited chastisement on the barbarians . It will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Navy respecting the disposition of our ships of war that it has been deemed necessary to station a competent force on the coast of Africa to prevent a fraudulent use of our flag by foreigners . Recent experience has shown that the provisions in our existing laws which relate to the sale and transfer of American vessels while abroad are extremely defective . Advantage has been taken of these defects to give to vessels wholly belonging to foreigners and navigating the ocean an apparent American ownership . This character has been so well simulated as to afford them comparative security in prosecuting the slave trade a traffic emphatically denounced in our statutes , regarded with abhorrence by our citizens , and of which the effectual suppression is nowhere more sincerely desired than in the United States . These circumstances make it proper to recommend to your early attention a careful revision of these laws , so that without impeding the freedom and facilities of our navigation or impairing an important branch of our industry connected with it the integrity and honor of our flag may be carefully preserved . Information derived from our consul at Havana showing the necessity of this was communicated to a committee of the Senate near the close of the last session , but too late , as it appeared , to be acted upon . It will be brought to your notice by the proper Department , with additional communications from other sources . The latest accounts from the exploring expedition represent it as proceeding successfully in its objects and promising results no less useful to trade and navigation than to science . The extent of post roads covered by mail service on the 1st of July last was about 133 , 999 miles and the rate of annual transportation upon them 34 , 496 , 878 miles . The number of post offices on that day was 12 , 780 and on the 30th ultimo 13 , 028 . The revenue of the Post Office Department for the year ending with the 30th of June last was 4 , 476 , 638 , exhibiting an increase over the preceding year of 241 , 560 . The engagements and liabilities of the Department for the same period are 4 , 624 , 117 . The excess of liabilities over the revenue for the last two years has been met out of the surplus which had previously accumulated . The cash on hand on the 30th ultimo was about 206 , 701 . 95 and the current income of the Department varies very little from the rate of current expenditures . Most of the service suspended last year has been restored , and most of the new routes established by the act of 7th July , 1838 , have been set in operation , at an annual cost of 136 , 963 . Notwithstanding the pecuniary difficulties of the country , the revenue of the Department appears to be increasing , and unless it shall be seriously checked by the recent suspension of payment by so many of the banks it will be able not only to maintain the present mail service , but in a short time to extend it . It is gratifying to witness the promptitude and fidelity with which the agents of this Department in general perform their public duties . Some difficulties have arisen in relation to contracts for the transportation of the mails by railroad and steamboat companies . It appears that the maximum of compensation provided by Congress for the transportation of the mails upon railroads is not sufficient to induce some of the companies to convey them at such hours as are required for the accommodation of the public . It is one of the most important duties of the General Government to provide and maintain for the use of the people of the States the best practicable mail establishment . To arrive at that end it is indispensable that the Post Office Department shall be enabled to control the hours at which the mails shall be carried over railroads , as it now does over all other roads . Should serious inconveniences arise from the inadequacy of the compensation now provided by law , or from unreasonable demands by any of the railroad companies , the subject is of such general importance as to require the prompt attention of Congress . In relation to steamboat lines , the most efficient remedy is obvious and has been suggested by the Postmaster General . The War and Navy Departments already employ steamboats in their service and although it is by no means desirable that the Government should undertake the transportation of passengers or freight as a business , there can be no reasonable objection to running boats , temporarily , whenever it may be necessary to put down attempts at extortion , to be discontinued as soon as reasonable contracts can be obtained . The suggestions of the Postmaster General relative to the inadequacy of the legal allowance to witnesses in cases of prosecutions for mail depredations merit your serious consideration . The safety of the mails requires that such prosecutions shall be efficient , and justice to the citizen whose time is required to be given to the public demands not only that his expenses shall be paid , but that he shall receive a reasonable compensation . The reports from the War , Navy , and Post Office Departments will accompany this communication , and one from the Treasury Department will be presented to Congress in a few days . For various details in respect to the matters in charge of these Departments I would refer you to those important documents , satisfied that you will find in them many valuable suggestions which will be found well deserving the attention of the Legislature . From a report made in December of last year by the Secretary of State to the Senate , showing the trial docket of each of the circuit courts and the number of miles each judge has to travel in the performance of his duties , a great inequality appears in the amount of labor assigned to each judge . The number of terms to be held in each of the courts composing the ninth circuit , the distances between the places at which they sit and from thence to the seat of Government , are represented to be such as to render it impossible for the judge of that circuit to perform in a manner corresponding with the public exigencies his term and circuit duties . A revision , therefore , of the present arrangement of the circuit seems to be called for and is recommended to your notice . I think it proper to call your attention to the power assumed by Territorial legislatures to authorize the issue of bonds by corporate companies on the guaranty of the Territory . Congress passed a law in 1836 providing that no act of a Territorial legislature incorporating banks should have the force of law until approved by Congress , but acts of a very exceptionable character previously passed by the legislature of Florida were suffered to remain in force , by virtue of which bonds may be issued to a very large amount by those institutions upon the faith of the Territory . A resolution , intending to be a joint one , passed the Senate at the same session , expressing the sense of Congress that the laws in question ought not to be permitted to remain in force unless amended in many material respects but it failed in the House of Representatives for want of time , and the desired amendments have not been made . The interests involved are of great importance , and the subject deserves your early and careful attention . The continued agitation of the question relative to the best mode of keeping and disbursing the public money still injuriously affects the business of the country . The suspension of specie payments in 1837 rendered the use of deposit banks as prescribed by the act of 1836 a source rather of embarrassment than aid , and of necessity placed the custody of most of the public money afterwards collected in charge of the public officers . The new securities for its safety which this required were a principal cause of my convening an extra session of Congress , but in consequence of a disagreement between the two Houses neither then nor at any subsequent period has there been any legislation on the subject . The effort made at the last session to obtain the authority of Congress to punish the use of public money for private purposes as a crime a measure attended under other governments with signal advantage was also unsuccessful , from diversities of opinion in that body , notwithstanding the anxiety doubtless felt by it to afford every practicable security . The result of this is still to leave the custody of the public money without those safeguards which have been for several years earnestly desired by the Executive , and as the remedy is only to be found in the action of the Legislature it imposes on me the duty of again submitting to you the propriety of passing a law providing for the safe keeping of the public moneys , and especially to ask that its use for private purposes by any officers intrusted with it may be declared to be a felony , punishable with penalties proportioned to the magnitude of the offense . These circumstances , added to known defects in the existing laws and unusual derangement in the general operations of trade , have during the last three years much increased the difficulties attendant on the collection , keeping , and disbursement of the revenue , and called forth corresponding exertions from those having them in charge . Happily these have been successful beyond expectation . Vast sums have been collected and disbursed by the several Departments with unexpected cheapness and ease , transfers have been readily made to every part of the Union , however distant , and defalcations have been far less than might have been anticipated from the absence of adequate legal restraints . Since the officers of the Treasury and Post Office Departments were charged with the custody of most of the public moneys received by them there have been collected 66 , 000 , 000 , and , excluding the case of the late collector at New York , the aggregate amount of losses sustained in the collection can not , it is believed , exceed 60 , 000 . The defalcation of the late collector at that city , of the extent and circumstances of which Congress have been fully informed , ran through all the modes of keeping the public money that have been hitherto in use , and was distinguished by an aggravated disregard of duty that broke through the restraints of every system , and can not , therefore , be usefully referred to as a test of the comparative safety of either . Additional information will also be furnished by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury , in reply to a call made upon that officer by the House of Representatives at the last session requiring detailed information on the subject of defaults by public officers or agents under each Administration from 1789 to 1837 . This document will be submitted to you in a few days . The general results independent of the Post Office , which is kept separately and will be stated by itself , so far as they bear upon this subject , are that the losses which have been and are likely to be sustained by any class of agents have been the greatest by banks , including , as required in the resolution , their depreciated paper received for public dues that the next largest have been by disbursing officers , and the least by collectors and receivers . If the losses on duty bonds are included , they alone will be threefold those by both collectors and receivers . Our whole experience , therefore , furnishes the strongest evidence that the desired legislation of Congress is alone wanting to insure in those operations the highest degree of security and facility . Such also appears to have been the experience of other nations . From the results of inquiries made by the Secretary of the Treasury in regard to the practice among them I am enabled to state that in twenty two out of twenty seven foreign governments from which undoubted information has been obtained the public moneys are kept in charge of public officers . This concurrence of opinion in favor of that system is perhaps as great as exists on any question of internal administration . In the modes of business and official restraints on disbursing officers no legal change was produced by the suspension of specie payments . The report last referred to will be found to contain also much useful information in relation to this subject . I have heretofore assigned to Congress my reasons for believing that the establishment of an independent National Treasury , as contemplated by the Constitution , is necessary to the safe action of the Federal Government . The suspension of specie payments in 1837 by the banks having the custody of the public money showed in so alarming a degree our dependence on those institutions for the performance of duties required by law that I then recommended the entire dissolution of that connection . This recommendation has been subjected , as I desired it should be , to severe scrutiny and animated discussion , and I allow myself to believe that notwithstanding the natural diversities of opinion which may be anticipated on all subjects involving such important considerations , it has secured in its favor as general a concurrence of public sentiment as could be expected on one of such magnitude . Recent events have also continued to develop new objections to such a connection . Seldom is any bank , under the existing system and practice , able to meet on demand all its liabilities for deposits and notes in circulation . It maintains specie payments and transacts a profitable business only by the confidence of the public in its solvency , and whenever this is destroyed the demands of its depositors and note holders , pressed more rapidly than it can make collections from its debtors , force it to stop payment . This loss of confidence , with its consequences , occurred in 1837 , and afforded the apology of the banks for their suspension . The public then acquiesced in the validity of the excuse , and while the State legislatures did not exact from them their forfeited charters , Congress , in accordance with the recommendation of the Executive , allowed them time to pay over the public money they held , although compelled to issue Treasury notes to supply the deficiency thus created . It now appears that there are other motives than a want of public confidence under which the banks seek to justify themselves in a refusal to meet their obligations . Scarcely were the country and Government relieved in a degree from the difficulties occasioned by the general suspension of 1837 when a partial one , occurring within thirty months of the former , produced new and serious embarrassments , though it had no palliation in such circumstances as were alleged in justification of that which had previously taken place . There was nothing in the condition of the country to endanger a well managed banking institution commerce was deranged by no foreign war every branch of manufacturing industry was crowned with rich rewards , and the more than usual abundance of our harvests , after supplying our domestic wants , had left our granaries and storehouses filled with a surplus for exportation . It is in the midst of this that an irredeemable and depreciated paper currency is entailed upon the people by a large portion of the banks . They are not driven to it by the exhibition of a loss of public confidence or of a sudden pressure from their depositors or note holders , but they excuse themselves by alleging that the current of business and exchange with foreign countries , which draws the precious metals from their vaults , would require in order to meet it a larger curtailment of their loans to a comparatively small portion of the community than it will be convenient for them to bear or perhaps safe for the banks to exact . The plea has ceased to be one of necessity . Convenience and policy are now deemed sufficient to warrant these institutions in disregarding their solemn obligations . Such conduct is not merely an injury to individual creditors , but it is a wrong to the whole community , from whose liberality they hold most valuable privileges , whose rights they violate , whose business they derange , and the value of whose property they render unstable and insecure . It must be evident that this new ground for bank suspensions , in reference to which their action is not only disconnected with , but wholly independent of , that of the public , gives a character to their suspensions more alarming than any which they exhibited before , and greatly increases the impropriety of relying on the banks in the transactions of the Government . A large and highly respectable portion of our banking institutions are , it affords me unfeigned pleasure to state , exempted from all blame on account of this second delinquency . They have , to their great credit , not only continued to meet their engagements , but have even repudiated the grounds of suspension now resorted to . It is only by such a course that the confidence and good will of the community can be preserved , and in the sequel the best interests of the institutions themselves promoted New dangers to the banks are also daily disclosed from the extension of that system of extravagant credit of which they are the pillars . Formerly our foreign commerce was principally rounded on an exchange of commodities , including the precious metals , and leaving in its transactions but little foreign debt . Such is not now the case . Aided by the facilities afforded by the banks , mere credit has become too commonly the basis of trade . Many of the banks themselves , not content with largely stimulating this system among others , have usurped the business , while they impair the stability , of the mercantile community they have become borrowers instead of lenders they establish their agencies abroad they deal largely in stocks and merchandise they encourage the issue of State securities until the foreign market is glutted with them and , unsatisfied with the legitimate use of their own capital and the exercise of their lawful privileges , they raise by large loans additional means for every variety of speculation . The disasters attendant on this deviation from the former course of business in this country are now shared alike by banks and individuals to an extent of which there is perhaps no previous example in the annals of our country . So long as a willingness of the foreign lender and a sufficient export of our productions to meet any necessary partial payments leave the flow of credit undisturbed all appears to be prosperous , but as soon as it is checked by any hesitation abroad or by an inability to make payment there in our productions the evils of the system are disclosed . The paper currency , which might serve for domestic purposes , is useless to pay the debt due in Europe . Gold and silver are therefore drawn in exchange for their notes from the banks . To keep up their supply of coin these institutions are obliged to call upon their own debtors , who pay them principally in their own notes , which are as unavailable to them as they are to the merchants to meet the foreign demand . The calls of the banks , therefore , in such emergencies of necessity exceed that demand , and produce a corresponding curtailment of their accommodations and of the currency at the very moment when the state of trade renders it most inconvenient to be borne . The intensity of this pressure on the community is in proportion to the previous liberality of credit and consequent expansion of the currency . Forced sales of property are made at the time when the means of purchasing are most reduced , and the worst calamities to individuals are only at last arrested by an open violation of their obligations by the banks a refusal to pay specie for their notes and an imposition upon the community of a fluctuating and depreciated currency . These consequences are inherent in the present system . They are not influenced by the banks being large or small , created by National or State Governments . They are the results of the irresistible laws of trade or credit . In the recent events , which have so strikingly illustrated the certain effects of these laws , we have seen the bank of the largest capital in the Union , established under a national charter , and lately strengthened , as we were authoritatively informed , by exchanging that for a State charter with new and unusual privileges in a condition , too , as it was said , of entire soundness and great prosperity not merely unable to resist these effects , but the first to yield to them . Nor is it to be overlooked that there exists a chain of necessary dependence among these institutions which obliges them to a great extent to follow the course of others , notwithstanding its injustice to their own immediate creditors or injury to the particular community in which they are placed . This dependence of a bank , which is in proportion to the extent of its debts for circulation and deposits , is not merely on others in its own vicinity , but on all those which connect it with the center of trade . Distant banks may fail without seriously affecting those in our principal commercial cities , but the failure of the latter is felt at the extremities of the Union . The suspension at New York in 1837 was everywhere , with very few exceptions , followed as soon as it was known . That recently at Philadelphia immediately affected the banks of the South and West in a similar manner . This dependence of our whole banking system on the institutions in a few large cities is not found in the laws of their organization , but in those of trade and exchange . The banks at that center , to which currency flows and where it is required in payments for merchandise , hold the power of controlling those in regions whence it comes , while the latter possess no means of restraining them so that the value of individual property and the prosperity of trade through the whole interior of the country are made to depend on the good or bad management of the banking institutions in the great seats of trade on the seaboard . But this chain of dependence does not stop here . It does not terminate at Philadelphia or New York . It reaches across the ocean and ends in London , the center of the credit system . The same laws of trade which give to the banks in our principal cities power over the whole banking system of the United States subject the former , in their turn , to the money power in Great Britain . It is not denied that the suspension of the New York banks in 1837 , which was followed in quick succession throughout the Union , was produced by an application of that power , and it is now alleged , in extenuation of the present condition of so large a portion of our banks , that their embarrassments have arisen from the same cause . From this influence they can not now entirely escape , for it has its origin in the credit currencies of the two countries it is strengthened by the current of trade and exchange which centers in London , and is rendered almost irresistible by the large debts contracted there by our merchants , our banks , and our States . It is thus that an introduction of a new bank into the most distant of our villages places the business of that village within the influence of the money power in England it is thus that every new debt which we contract in that country seriously affects our own currency and extends over the pursuits of our citizens its powerful influence . We can not escape from this by making new banks , great or small , State or national . The same chains which bind those now existing to the center of this system of paper credit must equally fetter every similar institution we create . It is only by the extent to which this system has been pushed of late that we have been made fully aware of its irresistible tendency to subject our own banks and currency to a vast controlling power in a foreign lad , and it adds a new argument to those which illustrate their precarious situation . . Endangered in the first place by their own mismanagement and again by the conduct of every institution which connects them with the center of trade in our own country , they are yet subjected beyond all this to the effect of whatever measures policy , necessity , or caprice may induce those who control the credits of England to resort to . I mean not to comment upon these measures , present or past , and much less to discourage the prosecution of fair commercial dealing between the two countries , based on reciprocal benefits but it having now been made manifest that the power of inflicting these and similar injuries is by the resistless law of a credit currency and credit trade equally capable of extending their consequences through all the ramifications of our banking system , and by that means indirectly obtaining , particularly when our banks are used as depositories of the public moneys , a dangerous political influence in the United States , I have deemed it my duty to bring the subject to your notice and ask for it your serious consideration . Is an argument required beyond the exposition of these facts to show the impropriety of using our banking institutions as depositories of the public money Can we venture not only to encounter the risk of their individual and mutual mismanagement , but at the same time to place our foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest To do so is to impair the independence of our Government , as the present credit system has already impaired the independence of our banks it is to submit all its important operations , whether of peace or war , to be controlled or thwarted , at first by our own banks and then by a power abroad greater than themselves . I can not bring myself to depict the humiliation to which this Government and people might be sooner or later reduced if the means for defending their rights are to be made dependent upon those who may have the most powerful of motives to impair them . Nor is it only in reference to the effect of this state of things on the independence of our Government or of our banks that the subject presents itself for consideration it is to be viewed also in its relations to the general trade of our country . The time is not long passed when a deficiency of foreign crops was thought to afford a profitable market for the surplus of our industry , but now we await with feverish anxiety the news of the English harvest , not so much from motives of commendable sympathy , but fearful lest its anticipated failure should narrow the field of credit there . Does not this speak volumes to the patriot Can a system be beneficent , wise , or just which creates greater anxiety for interests dependent on foreign credit than for the general prosperity of our own country and the profitable exportation of the surplus produce of our labor The circumstances to which I have thus adverted appear to me to afford weighty reasons , developed by late events , to be added to those which I have on former occasions offered when submitting to your better knowledge and discernment the propriety of separating the custody of the public money from banking institutions . Nor has anything occurred to lessen , in my opinion , the force of what has been heretofore urged . The only ground on which that custody can be desired by the banks is the profitable use which they may make of the money . Such use would be regarded in individuals as a breach of trust or a crime of great magnitude , and yet it may be reasonably doubted whether , first and last , it is not attended with more mischievous consequences when permitted to the former than to the latter . The practice of permitting the public money to be used by its keepers , as here , is believed to be peculiar to this country and to exist scarcely anywhere else . To procure it here improper influences are appealed to , unwise connections are established between the Government and vast numbers of powerful State institutions , other motives than the public good are brought to bear both on the executive and legislative departments , and selfish combinations leading to special legislation are formed . It is made the interest of banking institutions and their stockholders throughout the Union to use their exertions for the increase of taxation and the accumulation of a surplus revenue , and while an excuse is afforded the means are furnished for those excessive issues which lead to extravagant trading and speculation and are the forerunners of a vast debt abroad and a suspension of the banks at home . Impressed , therefore , as I am with the propriety of the funds of the Government being withdrawn from the private use of either banks or individuals , and the public money kept by duly appointed public agents , and believing as I do that such also is the judgment which discussion , reflection , and experience have produced on the public mind , I leave the subject with you . It is , at all events , essential to the interests of the community and the business of the Government that a decision should be made . Most of the arguments that dissuade us from employing banks in the custody and disbursement of the public money apply with equal force to the receipt of their notes for public dues . The difference is only in form . In one instance the Government is a creditor for its deposits , and in the other for the notes it holds . They afford the same opportunity for using the public moneys , and equally lead to all the evils attendant upon it , since a bank can as safely extend its discounts on a deposit of its notes in the hands of a public officer as on one made in its own vaults . On the other hand , it would give to the Government no greater security , for in case of failure the claim of the note holder would be no better than that of a depositor . I am aware that the danger of inconvenience to the public and unreasonable pressure upon sound banks have been urged as objections to requiring the payment of the revenue in gold and silver . These objections have been greatly exaggerated . From the best estimates we may safely fix the amount of specie in the country at 85 , 000 , 000 , and the portion of that which would be employed at any one time in the receipts and disbursements of the Government , even if the proposed change were made at once , would not , it is now , after fuller investigation , believed exceed four or five millions . If the change were gradual , several years would elapse before that sum would be required , with annual opportunities in the meantime to alter the law should experience prove it to be oppressive or inconvenient . The portions of the community on whose business the change would immediately operate are comparatively small , nor is it believed that its effect would be in the least unjust or injurious to them . In the payment of duties , which constitute by far the greater portion of the revenue , a very large proportion is derived from foreign commission houses and agents of foreign manufacturers , who sell the goods consigned to them generally at auction , and after paying the duties out of the avails remit the rest abroad in specie or its equivalent . That the amount of duties should in such cases be also retained in specie can hardly be made a matter of complaint . Our own importing merchants , by whom the residue of the duties is paid , are not only peculiarly interested in maintaining a sound currency , which the measure in question will especially promote , but are from the nature of their dealings best able to know when specie will be needed and to procure it with the least difficulty or sacrifice . Residing , too , almost universally in places where the revenue is received and where the drafts used by the Government for its disbursements must concentrate , they have every opportunity to obtain and use them in place of specie should it be for their interest or convenience . Of the number of these drafts and the facilities they may afford , as well as of the rapidity with which the public funds are drawn and disbursed , an idea may be formed from the fact that of nearly 20 , 000 , 000 paid to collectors and receivers during the present year the average amount in their hands at any one time has not exceeded a million and a half , and of the fifteen millions received by the collector of New York alone during the present year the average amount held by him subject to draft during each week has been less than half a million . The ease and safety of the operations of the Treasury in keeping the public money are promoted by the application of its own drafts to the public dues . The objection arising from having them too long outstanding might be obviated and they yet made to afford to merchants and banks holding them an equivalent for specie , and in that way greatly lessen the amount actually required . Still less inconvenience will attend the requirement of specie in purchases of public lands . Such purchases , except when made on speculation , are in general but single transactions , rarely repeated by the same person and it is a fact that for the last year and a half , during which the notes of sound banks have been received , more than a moiety of these payments has been voluntarily made in specie , being a larger proportion than would have been required in three years under the graduation proposed . It is , moreover , a principle than which none is better settled by experience that the supply of the precious metals will always be found adequate to the uses for which they are required . They abound in countries where no other currency is allowed . In our own States , where small notes are excluded , gold and silver supply their place . When driven to their hiding places by bank suspensions , a little firmness in the community soon restores them in a sufficient quantity for ordinary purposes . Postage and other public dues have been collected in coin without serious inconvenience even in States where a depreciated paper currency has existed for years , and this , with the aid of Treasury notes for a part of the time , was done without interruption during the suspension of 1837 . At the present moment the receipts and disbursements of the Government are made in legal currency in the largest portion of the Union . No one suggests a departure from this rule , and if it can now be successfully carried out it will be surely attended with even less difficulty when bank notes are again redeemed in specie . Indeed , I can not think that a serious objection would anywhere be raised to the receipt and payment of gold and silver in all public transactions were it not from an apprehension that a surplus in the Treasury might withdraw a large portion of it from circulation and lock it up unprofitably in the public vaults . It would not , in my opinion , be difficult to prevent such an inconvenience from occurring but the authentic statements which I have already submitted to you in regard to the actual amount in the public Treasury at any one time during the period embraced in them and the little probability of a different state of the Treasury for at least some years to come seem to render it unnecessary to dwell upon it . Congress , moreover , as I have before observed , will in every year have an opportunity to guard against it should the occurrence of any circumstances lead us to apprehend injury from this source . Viewing the subject in all its aspects , I can not believe that any period will be more auspicious than the present for the adoption of all measures necessary to maintain the sanctity of our own engagements and to aid in securing to the community that abundant supply of the precious metals which adds so much to their prosperity and gives such increased stability to all their dealings . In a country so commercial as ours banks in some form will probably always exist , but this serves only to render it the more incumbent on us , , notwithstanding the discouragements of the past , to strive in our respective stations to mitigate the evils they produce to take from them as rapidly as the obligations of public faith and a careful consideration of the immediate interests of the community will permit the unjust character of monopolies to check , so far as may be practicable , by prudent legislation those temptations of interest and those opportunities for their dangerous indulgence which beset them on every side , and to confine them strictly to the performance of their paramount duty that of aiding the operations of commerce rather than consulting their own exclusive advantage . These and other salutary reforms may , it is believed , be accomplished without the violation of any of the great principles of the social compact , the observance of which is indispensable to its existence , or interfering in any way with the useful and profitable employment of real capital . Institutions so framed have existed and still exist elsewhere , giving to commercial intercourse all necessary facilities without inflating or depreciating the currency or stimulating speculation . Thus accomplishing their legitimate ends , they have gained the surest guaranty for their protection and encouragement in the good will of the community . Among a people so just as ours the same results could not fail to attend a similar course . The direct supervision of the banks belongs , from the nature of our Government , to the States who authorize them . It is to their legislatures that the people must mainly look for action on that subject . But as the conduct of the Federal Government in the management of its revenue has also a powerful , though less immediate , influence upon them , it becomes our duty to see that a proper direction is given to it . While the keeping of the public revenue in a separate and independent treasury and of collecting it in gold and silver will have a salutary influence on the system of paper credit with which all banks are connected , and thus aid those that are sound and well managed , it will at the same time sensibly check such as are otherwise by at once withholding the means of extravagance afforded by the public funds and restraining them from excessive issues of notes which they would be constantly called upon to redeem . I am aware it has been urged that this control may be best attained and exerted by means of a national bank . The constitutional objections which I am well known to entertain would prevent me in any event from proposing or assenting to that remedy but in addition to this , I can not after past experience bring myself to think that it can any longer be extensively regarded as effective for such a purpose . The history of the late national bank , through all its mutations , shows that it was not so . On the contrary , it may , after a careful consideration of the subject , be , I think , safely stated that at every period of banking excess it took the lead that in 1817 and 1818 , in 1823 , in 1831 , and in 1834 its vast expansions , followed by distressing contractions , led to those of the State institutions . It swelled and maddened the tides of the banking system , but seldom allayed or safely directed them . At a few periods only was a salutary control exercised , but an eager desire , on the contrary , exhibited for profit in the first place and if afterwards its measures were severe toward other institutions , it was because its own safety compelled it to adopt them . It did not differ from them in principle or in form its measures emanated from the same spirit of gain it felt the same temptation to overissues it suffered from and was totally unable to avert those inevitable laws of trade by which it was . itself affected equally with them and at least on one occasion , at an early day , it was saved only by extraordinary exertions from the same fate that attended the weakest institution it professed to supervise . In 1837 it failed equally with others in redeeming its notes though the two years allowed by its charter for that purpose had not expired , a large amount of which remains to the present time outstanding . It is true that , having so vast a capital and strengthened by the use of all the revenues of the Government , it possessed more power but while it was itself by that circumstance freed from the control which all banks require , its paramount object and inducement were left the same to make the most for its stockholders , not to regulate the currency of the country . Nor has it , as far as we are advised , been found to be greatly otherwise elsewhere . The national character given to the Bank of England has not prevented excessive fluctuations in their currency , and it proved unable to keep off a suspension of specie payments , which lasted for nearly a quarter of a century . And why should we expect it to be otherwise A national institution , though deriving its charter from a different source than the State banks , is yet constituted upon the same principles , is conducted by men equally exposed to temptation , and is liable to the same disasters , with the additional disadvantage that its magnitude occasions an extent of confusion and distress which the mismanagement of smaller institutions could not produce . It can scarcely be doubted that the recent suspension of the United State Bank of Pennsylvania , of which the effects are felt not in that State alone , but over half the Union , had its origin in a course of business commenced while it was a national institution , and there is no good reason for supposing that the same consequences would not have followed had it still derived its powers from the General Government . It is in vain , when the influences and impulses are the same , to look for a difference in conduct or results . By such creations we do , therefore , but increase the mass of paper credit and paper currency , without checking their attendant evils and fluctuations . The extent of power and the efficiency of organization which we give , so far from being beneficial , are in practice positively injurious . They strengthen the chain of dependence throughout the Union , subject all parts more certainly to common disaster , and bind every bank more effectually in the first instance to those of our commercial cities , and in the end to a foreign power . In a word , I can not but believe that , with the full understanding of the operations of our banking system which experience has produced , public sentiment is not less opposed to the creation of a national bank for purposes connected with currency and commerce than for those connected with the fiscal operations of the Government . Yet the commerce and currency of the country are suffering evils from the operations of the State banks which can not and ought not to be overlooked . By their means we have been flooded with a depreciated paper , which it was evidently the design of the framers of the Constitution to prevent when they required Congress to Coin money and regulate the value of foreign coins , and when they forbade the States to coin money , emit bills of credit , make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts , or pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts . If they did not guard more explicitly against the present state of things , it was because they could not have anticipated that the few banks then existing were to swell to an extent which would expel to so great a degree the gold and silver for which they had provided from the channels of circulation , and fill them with a currency that defeats the objects they had in view . The remedy for this must chiefly rest with the States from whose legislation it has sprung . No good that might accrue in a particular case front the exercise of powers not obviously conferred on the General Government would authorize its interference or justify a course that might in the slightest degree increase at the expense of the States the power of the Federal authorities nor do I doubt that the States will apply the remedy . Within the last few years events have appealed to them too strongly to be disregarded . They have seen that the Constitution , though theoretically adhered to , is subverted in practice that while on the statute books there is no legal tender but gold and silver , no law impairing the obligations of contracts , yet that in point of fact the privileges conferred on banking corporations have made their notes the currency of the country that the obligations imposed by these notes are violated under the impulses of interest or convenience , and that the number and power of the persons connected with these corporations or placed under their influence give them a fearful weight when their interest is in opposition to the spirit of the Constitution and laws . To the people it is immaterial whether these results are produced by open violations of the latter or by the workings of a system of which the result is the same . An inflexible execution even of the existing statutes of most of the States would redress many evils now endured , would effectually show the banks the dangers of mismanagement which impunity encourages them to repeat , and would teach all corporations the useful lesson that they are the subjects of the law and the servants of the people . What is still wanting to effect these objects must be sought in additional legislation , or , if that be inadequate , in such further constitutional grants or restrictions as may bring us back into the path from which we have so widely wandered . In the meantime it is the duty of the General Government to cooperate with the States by a wise exercise of its constitutional powers and the enforcement of its existing laws . The extent to which it may do so by further enactments I have already adverted to , and the wisdom of Congress may yet enlarge them . But above all , it is incumbent upon us to hold erect the principles of morality and law , constantly executing our own contracts in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution , and thus serving as a rallying point by which our whole country may be brought back to that safe and honored standard . Our people will not long be insensible to the extent of the burdens entailed upon them by the false system that has been operating on their sanguine , energetic , and industrious character , nor to the means necessary to extricate themselves from these embarrassments . The weight which presses upon a large portion of the people and the States is an enormous debt , foreign and domestic . The foreign debt of our States , corporations , and men of business can scarcely be less than 200 , 000 , 000 , requiring more than 10 , 000 , 000 a year to pay the interest . This sum has to be paid out of the exports of the country , and must of necessity cut off imports to that extent or plunge the country more deeply in debt from year to year . It is easy to see that the increase of this foreign debt must augment the annual demand on the exports to pay the interest , and to the same extent diminish the imports , and in proportion to the enlargement of the foreign debt and the consequent increase of interest must be the decrease of the import trade . In lieu of the comforts which it now brings us we might have our . gigantic banking institutions and splendid , but in many instances profitless , railroads and canals absorbing to a great extent in interest upon the capital borrowed to construct them the surplus fruits of national industry for years to come , and securing to posterity no adequate return for the comforts which the labors of their hands might otherwise have secured . It is not by the increase of this debt that relief is to be sought , but in its diminution . Upon this point there is , I am happy to say , hope before us not so much in the return of confidence abroad , which will enable the States to borrow more money , as in a change of public feeling at home , which prompts our people to pause in their career and think of the means by which debts are to be paid before they are contracted . If we would escape embarrassment , public and private , we must cease to run in debt except for objects of necessity or such as will yield a certain return . Let the faith of the States , corporations , and individuals already pledged be kept with the most punctilious regard . It is due to our national character as well as to justice that this should on the part of each be a fixed principle of conduct . But it behooves us all to be more chary in pledging it hereafter . By ceasing to run in debt and applying the surplus of our crops and incomes to the discharge of existing obligations , buying less and selling more , and managing all affairs , public and private , with strict economy and frugality , we shall see our country soon recover from a temporary depression , arising not from natural and permanent causes , but from those I have enumerated , and advance with renewed vigor in her career of prosperity . Fortunately for us at this moment , when the balance of trade is greatly against us and the difficulty of meeting it enhanced by the disturbed state of our money affairs , the bounties of Providence have come to relieve us from the consequences of past errors . A faithful application of the immense results of the labors of the last season will afford partial relief for the present , and perseverance in the same course will in due season accomplish the rest . We have had full experience in times past of the extraordinary results which can in this respect be brought about in a short period by the united and well directed efforts of a community like ours . Our surplus profits , the energy and industry of our population , and the wonderful advantages which Providence has bestowed upon our country in its climate , its various productions , indispensable to other nations , will in due time afford abundant means to perfect the most useful of those objects for which the States have been plunging themselves of late in embarrassment and debt , without imposing on ourselves or our children such fearful burdens . But let it be indelibly engraved on our minds that relief is not to be found in expedients . Indebtedness can not be lessened by borrowing more money . or by changing the form of the debt . The balance of trade is not to be turned in our favor by creating new demands upon us abroad . Our currency can not be improved by the creation of new banks or more issues from those which now exist . Although these devices sometimes appear to give temporary relief , they almost invariably aggravate the evil in the end . It is only by retrenchment and reform by curtailing public and private expenditures , by paying our debts , and by reforming our banking system that we are to expect effectual relief , security for the future , and an enduring prosperity . In shaping the institutions and policy of the General Government so as to promote as far as it can with its limited powers these important ends , you may rely on my most cordial cooperation . That there should have been in the progress of recent events doubts in many quarters and in some a heated opposition to every change can not surprise us . Doubts are properly attendant on all reform , and it is peculiarly in the nature of such abuses as we are now encountering to seek to perpetuate their power by means of the influence they have been permitted to acquire . It is their result , if not their object , to gain for the few an ascendency over the many by securing to them a monopoly of the currency , the medium through which most of the wants of mankind are supplied to produce throughout society a chain of dependence which leads all classes to look to privileged associations for the means of speculation and extravagance to nourish , in preference to the manly virtues that give dignity to human nature , a craving desire for luxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth , which renders those who seek them dependent on those who supply them to substitute for republican simplicity and economical habits a sickly appetite for effeminate indulgence and an imitation of that reckless extravagance which impoverished and enslaved the industrious people of foreign lands , and at last to fix upon us , instead of those equal political rights the acquisition of which was alike the object and supposed reward of our Revolutionary struggle , a system of exclusive privileges conferred by partial legislation . To remove the influences which had thus gradually grown up among us , to deprive them of their deceptive advantages , to test them by the light of wisdom and truth , to oppose the force which they concentrate in their sup port all this was necessarily the work of time , even among a people so enlightened and pure as that of the United States . In most other countries , perhaps , it could only be accomplished through that series of revolutionary movements which are too often found necessary to effect any great and radical reform but it is the crowning merit of our institutions that they create and nourish in the vast majority of our people a disposition and a power peaceably to remedy abuses which have elsewhere caused the effusion of rivers of blood and the sacrifice of thousands of the human race . The result thus far is most honorable to the self denial , the intelligence , and the patriotism of our citizens it justifies the confident hope that they will carry through the reform which has been so well begun , and that they will go still further than they have yet gone in illustrating the important truth that a people as free and enlightened as ours will , whenever it becomes necessary , show themselves to be indeed capable of self government by voluntarily adopting appropriate remedies for every abuse , and submitting to temporary sacrifices , however great , to insure their permanent welfare . My own exertions for the furtherance of these desirable objects have been bestowed throughout my official career with a zeal that is nourished by ardent wishes for the welfare of my country , and by an unlimited reliance on the wisdom that marks its ultimate decision on all great and controverted questions . Impressed with the solemn obligations imposed upon me by the Constitution , desirous also of laying before my fellow citizens , with whose confidence and support I have been so highly honored , such measures as appear to me conducive to their prosperity , and anxious to submit to their fullest consideration the grounds upon which my opinions are formed , I have on this as on preceding occasions freely offered my views on those points of domestic policy that seem at the present time most prominently to require the action of the Government . I know that they will receive from Congress that full and able consideration which the importance of the subjects merits , and I can repeat the assurance heretofore made that I shall cheerfully and readily cooperate with you in every measure that will tend to promote the welfare of the Union .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives We have reason to renew the expression of our devout gratitude to the Giver of All Good for His benign protection . Our country presents on every side the evidences of that continued favor under whose auspices it , has gradually risen from a few feeble and dependent colonies to a prosperous and powerful confederacy . We are blessed with domestic tranquillity and all the elements of national prosperity . The pestilence which , invading for a time some flourishing portions of the Union , interrupted the general prevalence of unusual health has happily been limited in extent and arrested in its fatal career . The industry and prudence of our citizens are gradually relieving them from the pecuniary embarrassments under which portions of them have labored judicious legislation and the natural and boundless resources of the country have afforded wise end timely aid to private enterprise , and the activity always characteristic of our people has already in a great degree resumed its usual and profitable channels . The condition of our foreign relations has not materially changed since the last annual message of my predecessor . We remain at peace with all nations , and no efforts on my part consistent with the preservation of our rights and the honor of the country shall be spared to maintain a position so consonant to our institutions . We have faithfully sustained the foreign policy with which the United States , under the guidance of their first President , took their stand in the family of nations that of regulating their intercourse with other powers by the approved principles of private life asking and according equal rights and equal privileges rendering and demanding justice in all cases advancing their own and discussing the pretensions of others with candor , directness , and sincerity appealing at all times to reason , but never yielding to force nor seeking to acquire anything for themselves by its exercise . A rigid adherence to this policy has left this Government with scarcely a claim upon its justice for injuries arising from acts committed by its authority . The most imposing and perplexing of those of the United States upon foreign governments for aggressions upon our citizens were disposed of by my predecessor . Independently of the benefits conferred upon our citizens by restoring to the mercantile community so many millions of which they had been wrongfully divested , a great service was also rendered to his country by the satisfactory adjustment of so many ancient and irritating subjects of contention and it reflects no ordinary credit on his successful administration of public affairs that this great object was accomplished without compromising on any occasion either the honor or the peace of the nation . With European powers no new subjects of difficulty have arisen , and those which were under discussion , although not terminated , do not present a more unfavorable aspect for the future preservation of that good understanding which it has ever been our desire to cultivate . Of pending questions the most important is that which exists with the Government of Great Britain in respect to our northeastern boundary . It is with unfeigned regret that the people of the United States must look back upon the abortive efforts made by the Executive , for a period of more than half a century , to determine what no nation should suffer long to remain in dispute the true line which divides its possessions from those of other powers . The nature of the settlements on the borders of the United States and of the neighboring territory was for a season such that this , perhaps , was not indispensable to a faithful performance of the duties of the Federal Government . Time has , however , changed this state of things , and has brought about a condition of affairs in which the true interests of both countries imperatively require that this question should be put at rest . It is not to be disguised that , with full confidence , often expressed , in the desire of the British Government to terminate it , we are apparently as far from its adjustment as we were at the time of signing the treaty of peace in 1783 . The sole result of long pending negotiations and a perplexing arbitration appears to be a conviction on its part that a conventional line must be adopted , from the impossibility of ascertaining the true one according to the description contained in that treaty . Without coinciding in this opinion , which is not thought to be well rounded , my predecessor gave the strongest proof of the earnest desire of the United States to terminate satisfactorily this dispute by proposing the substitution of a conventional line if the consent of the States interested in the question could be obtained . To this proposition no answer has as yet been received . The attention of the British Government has , however , been urgently invited to the subject , and its reply can not , I am confident , be much longer delayed . The general relations between Great Britain and the United States are of the most friendly character , and I am well satisfied of the sincere disposition of that Government to maintain them upon their present footing . This disposition has also , I am persuaded , become more general with the people of England than at any previous period . It is scarcely necessary to say to you how cordially it is reciprocated by the Government and people of the United States . The conviction , which must be common to all , of the injurious consequences that result from keeping open this irritating question , and the certainty that its final settlement can not be much longer deferred , will , I trust , lead to an early and satisfactory adjustment . At your last session I laid before you the recent communications between the two Governments and between this Government and that of the State of Maine , in whose solicitude concerning a subject in which she has so deep an interest every portion of the Union participates . The feelings produced by a temporary interruption of those harmonious relations between France and the United States which are due as well to the recollections of former times as to a correct appreciation of existing interests have been happily succeeded by a cordial disposition on both sides to cultivate an active friendship in their future intercourse . The opinion , undoubtedly correct , and steadily entertained by us , that the commercial relations at present existing between the two countries are susceptible of great and reciprocally beneficial improvements is obviously gaining ground in France , and I am assured of the disposition of that Government to favor the accomplishment of such an object . This disposition shall be met in a proper spirit on our part . The few and comparatively unimportant questions that remain to be adjusted between us can , I have no doubt , be settled with entire satisfaction and without difficulty . Between Russia and the United States sentiments of good will continue to be mutually cherished . Our minister recently accredited to that Court has been received with a frankness and cordiality and with evidences of respect for his country which leave us no room to doubt the preservation in future of those amicable and liberal relations which have so long and so uninterruptedly existed between the two countries . On the few subjects under discussion between us an early and just decision is confidently anticipated . A correspondence has been opened with the Government of Austria for the establishment of diplomatic relations , in conformity with the wishes of Congress as indicated by an appropriation act of the session of 1837 , and arrangements made for the purpose , which will be duly carried into effect . With Austria and Prussia and with the States of the German Empire now composing with the latter the Commercial League our political relations are of the most friendly character , whilst our commercial intercourse is gradually extending , with benefit to all who are engaged in it . Civil war yet rages in Spain , producing intense suffering to its own people , and to other nations inconvenience and regret . Our citizens who have claims upon that country will be prejudiced for a time by the condition of its treasury , the inevitable consequence of long continued and exhausting internal wars . The last installment of the interest of the debt due under the convention with the Queen of Spain has not been paid and similar failures may be expected to happen until a portion of the resources of her Kingdom can be devoted to the extinguishment of its foreign debt . Having received satisfactory evidence that discriminating tonnage duties were charged upon the vessels of the United States in the ports of Portugal , a proclamation was issued on the 11th day of October last , in compliance with the act of May 25 , 1832 , declaring that fact , and the duties on foreign tonnage which were levied upon Portuguese vessels in the United States previously to the passage of that act are accordingly revived . The act of July 4 , 1836 , suspending the discriminating duties upon the produce of Portugal imported into this country in Portuguese vessels , was passed , upon the application of that Government through its representative here , under the belief that no similar discrimination existed in Portugal to the prejudice of the United States . I regret to state that such duties are now exacted in that country upon the cargoes of American vessels , and as the act referred to vests no discretion in the Executive , it is for Congress to determine upon the expediency of further legislation on the subject . Against these discriminations affecting the vessels of this country and their cargoes seasonable remonstrance was made , and notice was given to the Portuguese Government that unless they should be discontinued the adoption of countervailing measures on the part of the United States would become necessary but the reply of that Government , received at the Department of State through our charge d affaires at Lisbon in the month of September last , afforded no ground to hope for the abandonment of a system so little in harmony with the treatment shown to the vessels of Portugal and their cargoes in the ports of this country and so contrary to the expectations we had a right to entertain . With Holland , Sweden , Denmark , Naples , and Belgium a friendly intercourse has been uninterruptedly maintained . With the Government of the Ottoman Porte and its dependencies on the coast of the Mediterranean peace and good will are carefully cultivated , and have been fostered by such good offices as the relative distance and the condition of those countries would permit . Our commerce with Greece is carried on under the laws of the two Governments , reciprocally beneficial to the navigating interests of both and I have reason to look forward to the adoption of other measures which will be more extensively and permanently advantageous . Copies of the treaties concluded with the Governments of Siam and Muscat are transmitted for the information of Congress , the ratifications having been received and the treaties made public since the close of the last annual session . Already have we reason to congratulate ourselves on the prospect of considerable commercial benefit and we have , besides , received from the Sultan of Muscat prompt evidence of his desire to cultivate the most friendly feelings , by liberal acts toward one of our vessels , bestowed in a manner so striking as to require on our part a grateful acknowledgment . Our commerce with the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico still labors under heavy restrictions , the continuance of which is a subject of regret . The only effect of an adherence to them will be to benefit the navigation of other countries at the expense of both the United States and Spain . The independent nations of this continent have ever since they emerged from the colonial state experienced severe trials in their progress to the permanent establishment of liberal political institutions . Their unsettled condition not only interrupts their own advances to prosperity , but has often seriously injured the other powers of the world . The claims of our citizens upon Peru , Chili , Brazil , the Argentine Republic , the Governments formed out of the Republics of Colombia and Mexico , are still pending , although many of them have been presented for examination more than twenty years . New Granada , Venezuela , and Ecuador have recently formed a convention for the purpose of ascertaining and adjusting claims upon the Republic of Colombia , from which it is earnestly hoped our citizens will ere long receive full compensation for the injuries inflicted upon them and for the delay in affording it . An advantageous treaty of commerce has been concluded by the United States with the Peru Bolivian Confederation , which wants only the ratification of that Government . The progress of a subsequent negotiation for the settlement of claims upon Peru has been unfavorably affected by the war between that power and Chili and the Argentine Republic , and the same event is also likely to produce delays in the settlement of out demands on those powers . The aggravating circumstances connected with our claims upon Mexico and a variety of events touching the honor and integrity of our Government led my predecessor to make at the second session of the last Congress a special recommendation of the course to be pursued to obtain a speedy and final satisfaction of the injuries complained of by this Government and by our citizens . He recommended a final demand of redress , with a contingent authority to the Executive to make reprisals if that demand should be made in vain . From the proceedings of Congress on that recommendation it appeared that the opinion of both branches of the Legislature coincided with that of the Executive , that any mode of redress known to the law of nations might justifiably be used . It was obvious , too , that Congress believed with the President that another demand should be made , in order to give undeniable and satisfactory proof of our desire to avoid extremities with a neighboring power , but that there was an indisposition to vest a discretionary authority in the Executive to take redress should it unfortunately be either denied or unreasonably delayed by the Mexican Government . So soon as the necessary documents were prepared , after entering upon the duties of my office , a special messenger was sent to Mexico to make a final demand of redress , with the documents required by the provisions of our treaty . The demand was made on the 20th of July last . The reply , which bears date the 29th of the same month , contains assurances of a desire on the part of that Government to give a prompt and explicit answer respecting each of the complaints , but that the examination of them would necessarily be deliberate that in this examination it would be guided by the principles of public law and the obligation of treaties that nothing should be left undone that might lead to the most speedy and equitable adjustment of our demands , and that its determination in respect to each case should be communicated through the Mexican minister here . Since that time an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary has been accredited to this Government by that of the Mexican Republic . He brought with him assurances of a sincere desire that the pending differences between the two Governments should be terminated in a manner satisfactory to both . He was received with reciprocal assurances , and a hope was entertained that his mission would lead to a speedy , satisfactory , and final adjustment of all existing subjects of complaint . A sincere believer in the wisdom of the pacific policy by which the United States have always been governed in their intercourse with foreign nations , it was my particular desire , from the proximity of the Mexican Republic and well known occurrences on our frontier , to be instrumental in obviating all existing difficulties with that Government and in restoring to the intercourse between the two Republics that liberal and friendly character by which they should always be distinguished . I regret , therefore , the more deeply to have found in the recent communications of that Government so little reason to hope that any future efforts of mine for the accomplishment of those desirable objects would be successful . Although the larger number and many of them aggravated cases of personal wrongs have been now for years before the Mexican Government , and some of the causes of national complaint , and those of the most offensive character , admitted of immediate , simple , and satisfactory replies , it is only within a few days past that any specific communication in answer to our last demand , made five months ago , has been received from the Mexican minister . By the report of the Secretary of State herewith presented and the accompanying documents it will be seen that for not one of our public complaints has satisfaction been given or offered , that but one of the cases of personal wrong has been favorably considered , and that but four cases of both descriptions out of all those formally presented and earnestly pressed have as yet been decided upon by the Mexican Government . Not perceiving in what manner any of the powers given to the Executive alone could be further usefully employed in bringing this unfortunate controversy to a satisfactory termination , the subject was by my predecessor referred to Congress as one calling for its interposition . In accordance with the clearly understood wishes of the Legislature , another and formal demand for satisfaction has been made upon the Mexican Government , with what success the documents now communicated will show . On a careful and deliberate examination of their contents , and considering the spirit manifested by the Mexican Government , it has become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stands to Congress , to whom it belongs to decide upon the time , the mode , and the measure of redress . Whatever may be your decision , it shall be faithfully executed , confident that it will be characterized by that moderation and justice which will , I trust , under all circumstances govern the councils of our country . The balance in the Treasury on the 1st January , 1837 , was 45 , 968 , 523 . The receipts during the present year from all sources , including the amount of Treasury notes issued , are estimated at 23 , 499 , 981 , constituting an aggregate of 69 , 468 , 504 . Of this amount about 35 , 281 , 361 will have been expended at the end of the year on appropriations made by Congress , and the residue , amounting to 34 , 187 , 143 , will be the nominal balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next but of that sum only 1 , 085 , 498 is considered as immediately available for and applicable to public purposes . Those portions of it which will be for some time unavailable consist chiefly of sums deposited with the States and due from the former deposit banks . The details upon this subject will be found in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury . The amount of Treasury notes which it will be necessary to issue during the year on account of those funds being unavailable will , it is supposed , not exceed four and a half millions . It seemed proper , in the condition of the country , to have the estimates on all subjects made as low as practicable without prejudice to any great public measures . The Departments were therefore desired to prepare their estimates accordingly , and I am happy to find that they have been able to graduate them on so economical a scale . In the great and often unexpected fluctuations to which the revenue is subjected it is not possible to compute the receipts beforehand with great certainty , but should they not differ essentially from present anticipations , and should the appropriations not much exceed the estimates , no difficulty seems likely to happen in defraying the current expenses with promptitude and fidelity . Notwithstanding the great embarrassments which have recently occurred in commercial affairs , and the liberal indulgence which in consequence of these embarrassments has been extended to both the merchants and the banks , it is gratifying to be able to anticipate that the Treasury notes which have been issued during the present year will be redeemed and that the resources of the Treasury , without any resort to loans or increased taxes , will prove ample for defraying all charges imposed on it during 1838 . The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will afford you a more minute exposition of all matters connected with the administration of the finances during the current year a period which for the amount of public moneys disbursed and deposited with the States , as well as the financial difficulties encountered and overcome , has few parallels in our history . Your attention was at the last session invited to the necessity of additional legislative provisions in respect to the collection , safe keeping , and transfer of the public money . No law having been then matured , and not understanding the proceedings of Congress as intended to be final , it becomes my duty again to bring the subject to your notice . On that occasion three modes of performing this branch of the public service were presented for consideration . These were , the creation of a national bank the revival , with modifications , of the deposit system established by the act of the 23d of June , 1836 , permitting the use of the public moneys by the banks and the discontinuance of the use of such institutions for the purposes referred to , with suitable provisions for their accomplishment through the agency of public officers . Considering the opinions of both Houses of Congress on the first two propositions as expressed in the negative , in which I entirely concur , it is unnecessary for me again in to recur to them . In respect to the last , you have had an opportunity since your adjournment not only to test still further the expediency of the measure by the continued practical operation of such parts of it as are now in force , but also to discover what should ever be sought for and regarded with the utmost deference the opinions and wishes of the people . The national will is the supreme law of the Republic , and on all subjects within the limits of his constitutional powers should be faithfully obeyed by the public servant . Since the measure in question was submitted to your consideration most of you have enjoyed the advantage of personal communication with your constituents . For one State only has an election been held for the Federal Government but the early day at which it took place deprived the measure under consideration of much of the support it might otherwise have derived from the result . Local elections for State officers have , however , been held in several of the States , at which the expediency of the plan proposed by the Executive has been . more or less discussed . You will , I am confident , yield to their results the respect due to every expression of the public voice . Desiring , however , to arrive at truth and a just view of the subject in all its bearings , you will at the same time remember that questions of far deeper and more immediate local interest than the fiscal plans of the National Treasury were involved in those elections . Above all , we can not overlook the striking fact that there were at the time in those States more than one hundred and sixty millions of bank capital , of which large portions were subject to actual forfeiture , other large portions upheld only by special and limited legislative indulgences , and most of it , if not all , to a greater or less extent dependent for a continuance of its corporate existence upon the will of the State legislatures to be then chosen . Apprised of this circumstance , you will judge whether it is not most probable that the peculiar condition of that vast interest in these respects , the extent to which it has been spread through all the ramifications of society , its direct connection with the then pending elections , and the feelings it was calculated to infuse into the canvass have exercised a far greater influence over the result than any which could possibly have been produced by a conflict of opinion in respect to a question in the administration of the General Government more remote and far less important in its bearings upon that interest . I have found no reason to change my own opinion as to the expediency of adopting the system proposed , being perfectly satisfied that there will be neither stability nor safety either in the fiscal affairs of the Government or in the pecuniary transactions of individuals and corporations so long as a connection exists between them which , like the past , offers such strong inducements to make them the subjects of political agitation . Indeed , I am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government would be exposed by any further increase of the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities . I can not , therefore , consistently with my views of duty , advise a renewal of a connection which circumstances have dissolved . The discontinuance of the use of State banks for fiscal purposes ought not to be regarded as a measure of hostility toward those institutions . Banks properly established and conducted are highly useful to the business of the country , and will doubtless continue to exist in the States so long as they conform to their laws and are found to be safe and beneficial . How they should be created , what privileges they should enjoy , under what responsibilities they should act , and to what restrictions they should be subject are questions which , as I observed on a previous occasion , belong to the States to decide . Upon their rights or the exercise of them the General Government can have no motive to encroach . Its duty toward them is well performed when it refrains from legislating for their special benefit , because such legislation would violate the spirit of the Constitution and be unjust to other interests when it takes no steps to impair their usefulness , but so manages its own affairs as to make it the interest of those institutions to strengthen and improve their condition for the security and welfare of the community at large . They have no right to insist on a connection with the Federal Government , nor on the use of the public money for their own benefit . The object of the measure under consideration is to avoid for the future a compulsory connection of this kind . It proposes to place the General Government , in regard to the essential points of the collection , safe keeping , and transfer of the public money , in a situation which shall relieve it from all dependence on the will of irresponsible individuals or corporations to withdraw those moneys from the uses of private trade and confide them to agents constitutionally selected and controlled by law to abstain from improper interference with the industry of the people and withhold inducements to improvident dealings on the part of individuals to give stability to the concerns of the Treasury to preserve the measures of the Government from the unavoidable reproaches that flow from such a connection , and the banks themselves from the injurious effects of a supposed participation in the political conflicts of the day , from which they will otherwise find it difficult to escape . These are my views upon this important subject , formed after careful reflection and with no desire but to arrive at what is most likely to promote the public interest . They are now , as they were before , submitted with unfeigned deference for the opinions of others . It was hardly to be hoped that changes so important on a subject so interesting could be made without producing a serious diversity of opinion but so long as those conflicting views are kept above the influence of individual or local interests , so long as they pursue only the general good and are discussed with moderation and candor , such diversity is a benefit , not an injury . If a majority of Congress see the public welfare in a different light , and more especially if they should be satisfied that the measure proposed would not be acceptable to the people , I shall look to their wisdom to substitute such as may be more conducive to the one and more satisfactory to the other . In any event , they may confidently rely on my hearty cooperation to the fullest extent to which my views of the Constitution and my sense of duty will permit . It is obviously important to this branch of the public service and to the business and quiet of the country that the whole subject should in some way be settled and regulated by law , and , if possible , at your present session . Besides the plans above referred to , I am not aware that any one has been suggested except that of keeping the public money in the State banks in special deposit . This plan is to some extent in accordance with the practice of the Government and with the present arrangements of the Treasury Department , which , except , perhaps , during the operation of the late deposit act , has always been allowed , even during the existence of a national bank , to make a temporary use of the State banks in particular places for the safe keeping of portions of the revenue . This discretionary power might be continued if Congress deem it desirable , whatever general system be adopted . So long as the connection is voluntary we need , perhaps , anticipate few of those difficulties and little of that dependence on the banks which must attend every such connection when compulsory in its nature and when so arranged as to make the banks a fixed part of the machinery of government . It is undoubtedly in the power of Congress so to regulate and guard it as to prevent the public money from being applied to the use or intermingled with the affairs of individuals . Thus arranged , although it would not give to the Government that entire control over its own funds which I desire to secure to it by the plan I have proposed , it would , it must be admitted , in a great degree accomplish one of the objects which has recommended that plan to my judgment the separation of the fiscal concerns of the Government from those of individuals or corporations . With these observations I recommend the whole matter to your dispassionate reflection , confidently hoping that some conclusion may be reached by your deliberations which on the one hand shall give safety and stability to the fiscal operations of the Government , and be consistent , on the other , with the genius of our institutions and with the interests and wishes of the great mass of our constituents . It was my hope that nothing would occur to make necessary on this occasion any allusion to the late national bank . There are circumstances , however , connected with the present state of its affairs that bear so directly on the character of the Government and the welfare of the citizen that I should not feel myself excused in neglecting to notice them . The charter which terminated its banking privileges on the 4th of March , 1836 , continued its corporate power two years more for the sole purpose of closing its affairs , with authority to use the corporate name , style , and capacity for the purpose of suits for a final settlement and liquidation of the affairs and acts of the corporation , and for the sale and disposition of their estate real , personal , and mixed but for no other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever . Just before the banking privileges ceased , its effects were transferred by the bank to a new State institution , then recently incorporated , in trust , for the discharge of its debts and the settlement of its affairs . With this trustee , by authority of Congress , an adjustment was subsequently made of the large interest which the Government had in the stock of the institution . The manner in which a trust unexpectedly created upon the act granting the charter , and involving such great public interests , has been executed would under any circumstances be a fit subject of inquiry but much more does it deserve your attention when it embraces the redemption of obligations to which the authority and credit of the United States have given value . The two years allowed are now nearly at an end . It is well understood that the trustee has not redeemed and canceled the outstanding notes of the bank , but has reissued and is actually reissuing , since the 3d of March , 1836 , the notes which have been received by it to a vast amount . According to its own official statement , so late as the 1st of October last , nineteen months after the banking privileges given by the charter had expired , it had under its control uncanceled notes of the late Bank of the United States to the amount of 27 , 561 , 866 , of which 6 , 175 , 861 were in actual circulation , 1 , 468 , 627 at State bank agencies , and 3 , 002 , 390 in transitu , thus showing that upward of ten millions and a half of the notes of the old bank were then still kept outstanding . The impropriety of this procedure is obvious , it being the duty of the trustee to cancel and not to put forth the notes of an institution whose concerns it had undertaken to wind up . If the trustee has a right to reissue these notes now , I can see no reason why it may not continue to do so after the expiration of the two years . As no one could have anticipated a course so extraordinary , the prohibitory clause of the charter above quoted was not accompanied by any penalty or other special provision for enforcing it , nor have we any general law for the prevention of similar acts in future . But it is not in this view of the subject alone that your interposition is required . The United States in settling with the trustee for their stock have withdrawn their funds from their former direct liability to the creditors of the old bank , yet notes of the institution continue to be sent forth in its name , and apparently upon the authority of the United States . The transactions connected with the employment of the bills of the old bank are of vast extent , and should they result unfortunately the interests of individuals may be deeply compromised . Without undertaking to decide how far or in what form , if any , the trustee could be made liable for notes which contain no obligation on its part , or the old bank for such as are put in circulation after the expiration of its charter and without its authority , or the Government for indemnity in case of loss , the question still presses itself upon your consideration whether it is consistent with duty and good faith on the part of the Government to witness this proceeding without a single effort to arrest it . The report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office , which will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury , will show how the affairs of that office have been conducted for the past year . The disposition of the public lands is one of the most important trusts confided to Congress . The practicability of retaining the title and control of such extensive domains in the General Government , and at the same time admitting the Territories embracing them into the Federal Union as coequals with the original States , was seriously doubted by many of our wisest statesmen . All feared that they would become a source of discord , and many carried their apprehensions so far as to see in them the seeds of a future dissolution of the Confederacy . But happily our experience has already been sufficient to quiet in a great degree all such apprehensions . The position at one time assumed , that the admission of new States into the Union on the same footing with the original States was incompatible with a right of soil in the United States and operated as a surrender thereof , notwithstanding the terms of the compacts by which their admission was designed to be regulated , has been wisely abandoned . Whether in the new or the old States , all now agree that the right of soil to the public lands remains in the Federal Government , and that these lands constitute a common property , to be disposed of for the common benefit of all the States , old and new . Acquiescence in this just principle by the people of the new States has naturally promoted a disposition to adopt the most liberal policy in the sale of the public lands . A policy which should be limited to the mere object of selling the lands for the greatest possible sum of money , without regard to higher considerations , finds but few advocates . On the contrary , it is generally conceded that whilst the mode of disposition adopted by the Government should always be a prudent one , yet its leading object ought to be the early settlement and cultivation of the lands sold , and that it should discountenance , if it can not prevent , the accumulation of large tracts in the same hands , which must necessarily retard the growth of the new States or entail upon them a dependent tenantry and its attendant evils . A question embracing such important interests and so well calculated to enlist the feelings of the people in every quarter of the Union has very naturally given rise to numerous plans for the improvement of the existing system . The distinctive features of the policy that has hitherto prevailed are to dispose of the public lands at moderate prices , thus enabling a greater number to enter into competition for their purchase and accomplishing a double object of promoting their rapid settlement by the purchasers and at the same time increasing the receipts of the Treasury to sell for cash , thereby preventing the disturbing influence of a large mass of private citizens indebted to the Government which they have a voice in controlling to bring them into market no faster than good lands are supposed to be wanted for improvement , thereby preventing the accumulation of large tracts in few hands and to apply the proceeds of the sales to the general purposes of the Government , thus diminishing the amount to be raised from the people of the States by taxation and giving each State its portion of the benefits to be derived from this common fund in a manner the most quiet , and at the same time , perhaps , the most equitable , that can be devised . These provisions , with occasional enactments in behalf of special interests deemed entitled to the favor of the Government , have in their execution produced results as beneficial upon the whole as could reasonably be expected in a matter so vast , so complicated , and so exciting . Upward of 70 , 000 , 000 , acres have been sold , the greater part of which is believed to have been purchased for actual settlement . The population of the new States and Territories created out of the public domain increased between 1800 and 1830 from less than 60 , 000 to upward of 2 , 300 , 000 souls , constituting at the latter period about one fifth of the whole people of the United States . The increase since can not be accurately known , but the whole may now be safely estimated at over three and a half millions of souls , composing nine States , the representatives of which constitute above one third of the Senate and over one sixth of the House of Representatives of the United States . Thus has been formed a body of free and independent landholders with a rapidity unequaled in the history of mankind and this great result has been produced without leaving anything for future adjustment between the Government and its citizens . The system under which so much has been accomplished can not be intrinsically bad , and with occasional modifications to correct abuses and adapt it to changes of circumstances may , I think , be safely trusted for the future . There is in the management of such extensive interests much virtue in stability and although great and obvious improvements should not be declined , changes should never be made without the fullest examination and the clearest demonstration of their practical utility . In the history of the past we have an assurance that this safe rule of action will not be departed from in relation to the public lands nor is it believed that any necessity exists for interfering with the fundamental principles of the system , or that the public mind , even in the new States , is desirous of any radical alterations . On the contrary , the general disposition appears to be to make such modifications and additions only as will the more effectually carry out the original policy of filling our new States and Territories with an industrious and independent population . The modification most perseveringly pressed upon Congress , which has occupied so much of its time for years past , and will probably do so for a long time to come , if not sooner satisfactorily adjusted , is a reduction in the cost of such portions of the public lands as are ascertained to be unsalable at the rate now established by law , and a graduation according to their relative value of the prices at which they may hereafter be sold . It is worthy of consideration whether justice may not be done to every interest in this matter , and a vexed question set at rest , perhaps forever , by a reasonable compromise of conflicting opinions . Hitherto , after being offered at public sale , lands have been disposed of at one uniform price , whatever difference there might be in their intrinsic value . The leading considerations urged in favor of the measure referred to are that in almost all the land districts , and particularly in those in which the lands have been long surveyed and exposed to sale , there are still remaining numerous and large tracts of every gradation of value , from the Government price downward that these lands will not be purchased at the Government price so long as better can be conveniently obtained for the same amount that there are large tracts which even the improvements of the adjacent lands will never raise to that price , and that the present uniform price , combined with their irregular value , operates to prevent a desirable compactness of settlements in the new States and to retard the full development of that wise policy on which our land system is founded , to the injury not only of the several States where the lands lie , but of the United States as a whole . The remedy proposed has been a reduction of the prices according to the length of time the lands have been in market , without reference to any other circumstances . The certainty that the efflux of time would not always in such cases , and perhaps not even generally , furnish a true criterion of value , and the probability that persons residing in the vicinity , as the period for the reduction of prices approached , would postpone purchases they would otherwise make , for the purpose of availing themselves of the lower price , with other considerations of a similar character , have hitherto been successfully urged to defeat the graduation upon time . May not all reasonable desires upon this subject be satisfied without encountering any of these objections All will concede the abstract principle that the price of the public lands should be proportioned to their relative value , so far as can be accomplished without departing from the rule heretofore observed requiring fixed prices in cases of private entries . The difficulty of the subject seems to lie in the mode of ascertaining what that value is . Would not the safest plan be that which has been adopted by many of the States as the basis of taxation an actual valuation of lands and classification of them into different rates Would it not be practicable and expedient to cause the relative value of the public lands in the old districts which have been for a certain length of time in market to be appraised and classed into two or more rates below the present minimum price by the officers now employed in this branch of the public service or in any other mode deemed preferable , and to make those prices permanent if upon the coming in of the report they shall prove satisfactory to Congress Could not all the objects of graduation be accomplished in this way , and the objections which have hitherto been urged against it avoided It would seem to me that such a step , with a restriction of the sales to limited quantities and for actual improvement , would be free from all just exception . By the full exposition of the value of the lands thus furnished and extensively promulgated persons living at a distance would be informed of their true condition and enabled to enter into competition with those residing in the vicinity the means of acquiring an independent home would be brought within the reach of many who are unable to purchase at present prices the population of the new States would be made more compact , and large tracts would be sold which would otherwise remain on hand . Not only would the land be brought within the means of a larger number of purchasers , but many persons possessed of greater means would be content to settle on a larger quantity of the poorer lands rather than emigrate farther west in pursuit of a smaller quantity of better lands . Such a measure would also seem to be more consistent with the policy of the existing laws that of converting the public domain into cultivated farms owned by their occupants . That policy is not best promoted by sending emigration up the almost interminable streams of the West to occupy in groups the best spots of land , leaving immense wastes behind them and enlarging the frontier beyond the means of the Government to afford it adequate protection , but in encouraging it to occupy with reasonable denseness the territory over which it advances , and find its best defense in the compact front which it presents to the Indian tribes . Many of you will bring to the consideration of the subject the advantages of local knowledge and greater experience , and all will be desirous of making an early and final disposition of every disturbing question in regard to this important interest . If these suggestions shall in any degree contribute to the accomplishment of so important a result , it will afford me sincere satisfaction . In some sections of the country most of the public lands have been sold , and the registers and receivers have very little to do . It is a subject worthy of inquiry whether in many cases two or more districts may not be consolidated and the number of persons employed in this business considerably reduced . Indeed , the time will come when it will be the true policy of the General Government , as to some of the States , to transfer to them for a reasonable equivalent all the refuse and unsold lands and to withdraw the machinery of the Federal land offices altogether . All who take a comprehensive view of our federal system and believe that one of its greatest excellencies consists in interfering as little as possible with the internal concerns of the States look forward with great interest to this result . A modification of the existing laws in respect to the prices of the public lands might also have a favorable influence on the legislation of Congress in relation to another branch of the subject . Many who have not the ability to buy at present prices settle on those lands with the hope of acquiring from their cultivation the means of purchasing under preemption laws from time to time passed by Congress . For this encroachment on the rights of the United States they excuse themselves under the plea of their own necessities the fact that they dispossess nobody and only enter upon the waste domain that they give additional value to the public lands in their vicinity , and their intention ultimately to pay the Government price . So much weight has from time to time been attached to these considerations that Congress have passed laws giving actual settlers on the public lands a right of preemption to the tracts occupied by them at the minimum price . These laws have in all instances been retrospective in their operation , but in a few years after their passage crowds of new settlers have been found on the public lands for similar reasons and under like expectations , who have been indulged with the same privilege . This course of legislation tends to impair public respect for the laws of the country . Either the laws to prevent intrusion upon the public lands should be executed , or , if that should be impracticable or inexpedient , they should be modified or repealed . If the public lands are to be considered as open to be occupied by any , they should by law be thrown open to all . That which is intended in all instances to be legalized should at once be made legal , that those who are disposed to conform to the laws may enjoy at least equal privileges with those who are not . But it is not believed to be the disposition of Congress to open the public lands to occupancy without regular entry and payment of the Government price , as such a course must tend to worse evils than the credit system , which it was found necessary to abolish . It would seem , therefore , to be the part of wisdom and sound policy to remove as far as practicable the causes which produce intrusions upon the public lands , and then take efficient steps to prevent them in future . Would any single measure be so effective in removing all plausible grounds for these intrusions as the graduation of price already suggested A short period of industry and economy in any part of our country would enable the poorest citizen to accumulate the means to buy him a home at the lower prices , and leave him without apology for settling on lands not his own . If he did not under such circumstances , he would enlist no sympathy in his favor , and the laws would be readily executed without doing violence to public opinion . A large portion of our citizens have seated themselves on the public lands without authority since the passage of the last preemption law , and now ask the enactment of another to enable them to retain the lands occupied upon payment of the minimum Government price . They ask that which has been repeatedly granted before . If the future may be judged of by the past , little harm can be done to the interests of the Treasury by yielding to their request . Upon a critical examination it is found that the lands sold at the public sales since the introduction of cash payments , in 1820 , have produced on an average the net revenue of only 6 cents an acre more than the minimum Government price . There is no reason to suppose that future sales will be more productive . The Government , therefore , has no adequate pecuniary interest to induce it to drive these people from the lands they occupy for the purpose of selling them to others . Entertaining these views , I recommend the passage of a preemption law for their benefit in connection with the preparatory steps toward the graduation of the price of the public lands , and further and more effectual provisions to prevent intrusions hereafter . Indulgence to those who have settled on these lands with expectations that past legislation would be made a rule for the future , and at the same time removing the most plausible ground on which intrusions are excused and adopting more efficient means to prevent them hereafter , appears to me the most judicious disposition which can be made of this difficult subject . The limitations and restrictions to guard against abuses in the execution of a preemption law will necessarily attract the careful attention of Congress , but under no circumstances is it considered expedient to authorize floating claims in any shape . They have been heretofore , and doubtless would be hereafter , most prolific sources of fraud and oppression , and instead of operating to confer the favor of the Government on industrious settlers are often used only to minister to a spirit of cupidity at the expense of the most meritorious of that class . The accompanying report of the Secretary of War will bring to your view the state of the Army and all the various subjects confided to the superintendence of that officer . The principal part of the Army has been concentrated in Florida , with a view and in the expectation of bringing the war in that Territory to a speedy close . The necessity of stripping the posts on the maritime and inland frontiers of their entire garrisons for the purpose of assembling in the field an army of less than 4 , 000 men would seem to indicate the necessity of increasing our regular forces and the superior efficiency , as well as greatly diminished expense of that description of troops , recommend this measure as one of economy as well as of expediency . I refer to the report for the reasons which have induced the Secretary of War to urge the reorganization and enlargement of the staff of the Army , and of the Ordnance Corps , in which I fully concur . It is not , however , compatible with the interests of the people to maintain in time of peace a regular force adequate to the defense of our extensive frontiers . In periods of danger and alarm we must rely principally upon a well organized militia , and some general arrangement that will render this description of force more efficient has long been a subject of anxious solicitude . It was recommended to the First Congress by General Washington , and has been since frequently brought to your notice , and recently its importance strongly urged by my immediate predecessor . The provision in the Constitution that renders it necessary to adopt a uniform system of organization for the militia throughout the United States presents an insurmountable obstacle to an efficient arrangement by the classification heretofore proposed , and I invite your attention to the plan which will be submitted by the Secretary of War , for the organization of volunteer corps and the instruction of militia officers , as more simple and practicable , if not equally advantageous , as a general arrangement of the whole militia of the United States . A moderate increase of the corps both of military and topographical engineers has been more than once recommended by my predecessor , and my conviction of the propriety , not to say necessity , of the measure , in order to enable them to perform the various and important duties imposed upon them , induces me to repeat the recommendation . The Military Academy continues to answer all the purposes of its establishment , and not only furnishes well educated officers to the Army , but serves to diffuse throughout the mass of our citizens individuals possessed of military knowledge and the scientific attainments of civil and military engineering . At present the cadet is bound , with consent of his parents or guardians , to remain in service five years from the period of his enlistment , unless sooner discharged , thus exacting only one year s service in the Army after his education is completed . This does not appear to me sufficient . Government ought to command for a longer period the services of those who are educated at the public expense , and I recommend that the time of enlistment be extended to seven years , and the terms of the engagement strictly enforced . The creation of a national foundry for cannon , to be common to the service of the Army and Navy of the United States , has been heretofore recommended , and appears to be required in order to place our ordnance on an equal footing with that of other countries and to enable that branch of the service to control the prices of those articles and graduate the supplies to the wants of the Government , as well as to regulate their quality and insure their uniformity . The same reasons induce me to recommend the erection of a manufactory of gunpowder , to be under the direction of the Ordnance Office . The establishment of a manufactory of small arms west of the Alleghany Mountains , upon the plan proposed by the Secretary of War , will contribute to extend throughout that country the improvements which exist in establishments of a similar description in the Atlantic States , and tend to a much more economical distribution of the armament required in the western portion of our Union . The system of removing the Indians west of the Mississippi , commenced by Jefferson in 1804 , has been steadily persevered in by every succeeding President , and may be considered the settled policy of the country . Unconnected at first with any well defined system for their improvement , the inducements held out to the Indians were confined to the greater abundance of game to be found in the West but when the beneficial effects of their removal were made apparent a more philanthropic and enlightened policy was adopted in purchasing their lands east of the Mississippi . Liberal prices were given and provisions inserted in all the treaties with them for the application of the funds they received in exchange to such purposes as were best calculated to promote their present welfare and advance their future civilization . These measures have been attended thus far with the happiest results . It will be seen by referring to the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that the most sanguine expectations of the friends and promoters of this system have been realized . The Choctaws , Cherokees , and other tribes that first emigrated beyond the Mississippi have for the most part abandoned the hunter state and become cultivators of the soil . The improvement in their condition has been rapid , and it is believed that they are now fitted to enjoy the advantages of a simple form of government , which has been submitted to them and received their sanction and I can not too strongly urge this subject upon the attention of Congress . Stipulations have been made with all the Indian tribes to remove them beyond the Mississippi , except with the bands of the Wyandots , the Six Nations in New York , the Menomonees , Munsees , and Stockbridges in Wisconsin , and Miamies in Indiana . With all but the Menomonees it is expected that arrangements for their emigration will be completed the present year . The resistance which has been opposed to their removal by some of the tribes even after treaties had been made with them to that effect has arisen from various causes , operating differently on each of them . In most instances they have been instigated to resistance by persons to whom the trade with them and the acquisition of their annuities were important , and in some by the personal influence of interested chiefs . These obstacles must be overcome , for the Government can not relinquish the execution of this policy without sacrificing important interests and abandoning the tribes remaining east of the Mississippi to certain destruction . The decrease in numbers of the tribes within the limits of the States and Territories has been most rapid . If they be removed , they can be protected from those associations and evil practices which exert so pernicious and destructive an influence over their destinies . They can be induced to labor and to acquire property , and its acquisition will inspire them with a feeling of independence . Their minds can be cultivated , and they can be taught the value of salutary and uniform laws and be made sensible of the blessings of free government and capable of enjoying its advantages . In the possession of property , knowledge , and a good government , free to give what direction they please to their labor , and sharers in the legislation by which their persons and the profits of their industry are to be protected and secured , they will have an ever present conviction ot the importance of union and peace among themselves and of the preservation of amicable relations with us . The interests of the United States would also be greatly promoted by freeing the relations between the General and State Governments from what has proved a most embarrassing incumbrance by a satisfactory adjustment of conflicting titles to lands caused by the occupation of the Indians , and by causing the resources of the whole country to be developed by the power of the State and General Governments and improved by the enterprise of a white population . Intimately connected with this subject is the obligation of the Government to fulfill its treaty stipulations and to protect the Indians thus assembled at their new residences from all interruptions and disturbances from any other tribes or nations of Indians or from any other person or persons whatsoever , and the equally solemn obligation to guard from Indian hostility its own border settlements , stretching along a line of more than 1 , 000 miles . To enable the Government to redeem this pledge to the Indians and to afford adequate protection to its own citizens will require the continual presence of a considerable regular force on the frontiers and the establishment of a chain of permanent posts . Examinations of the country are now making , with a view to decide on the most suitable points for the erection of fortresses and other works of defense , the results of which will be presented to you by the Secretary of War at an early day , together with a plan for the effectual protection of the friendly Indians and the permanent defense of the frontier States . By the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith communicated it appears that unremitted exertions have been made at the different navy yards to carry into effect all authorized measures for the extension and employment of our naval force . The launching and preparation of the ship of the line Pennsylvania and the complete repairs of the ships of the line Ohio , Delaware , and Columbus may be noticed as forming a respectable addition to this important arm of our national defense . Our commerce and navigation have received increased aid and protection during the present year . Our squadrons in the Pacific and on the Brazilian station have been much increased , and that in the Mediterranean , although small , is adequate to the present wants of our commerce in that sea . Additions have been made to our squadron on the West India station , where the large force under Commodore Dallas has been most actively and efficiently employed in protecting our commerce , in preventing the importation of slaves , and in cooperating with the officers of the Army in carrying on the war in Florida . The satisfactory condition of our naval force abroad leaves at our disposal the means of conveniently providing for a home squadron for the protection of commerce upon our extensive coast . The amount of appropriations required for such a squadron will be found in the general estimates for the naval service for the year 1838 . The naval officers engaged upon our coast survey have rendered important service to our navigation . The discovery of a new channel into the harbor of New York , through which our largest ships may pass without danger , must afford important commercial advantages to that harbor and add greatly to its value as a naval station . The accurate survey of Georges Shoals , off the coast of Massachusetts , lately completed , will render comparatively safe a navigation hitherto considered dangerous . Considerable additions have been made to the number of captains , commanders , lieutenants , surgeons , and assistant surgeons in the Navy . These additions were rendered necessary by the increased number of vessels put in commission to answer the exigencies of our growing commerce . Your attention is respectfully invited to the various suggestions of the Secretary for the improvement of the naval service . The report of the Postmaster General exhibits the progress and condition of the mail service . The operations of the Post Office Department constitute one of the most active elements of our national prosperity , and it is gratifying to observe with what vigor they are conducted . The mail routes of the United States cover an extent of about 142 , 877 miles , having been increased about 37 , 103 miles within the last two years . The annual mail transportation on these routes is about 36 , 228 , 962 miles , having been increased about 10 , 359 , 476 miles within the same period . The number of post offices has also been increased from 10 , 770 to 12 , 099 , very few of which receive the mails less than once a week , and a large portion of them daily . Contractors and postmasters in general are represented as attending to their duties with most commendable zeal and fidelity . The revenue of the Department within the year ending on the 30th of June last was 4 , 137 , 056 . 59 , and its liabilities accruing within the same time were 3 , 380 , 847 . 75 . The increase of revenue over that of the preceding year was 708 , 166 . 41 . For many interesting details I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General , with the accompanying papers , Your particular attention is invited to the necessity of providing a more safe and convenient building for the accommodation of that Department . I lay before Congress copies of reports submitted in pursuance of a call made by me upon the heads of Departments for such suggestions as their experience might enable them to make as to what further legislative provisions may be advantageously adopted to secure the faithful application of public moneys to the objects for which they are appropriated , to prevent their misapplication or embezzlement by those intrusted with the expenditure of them , and generally to increase the security of the Government against losses in their disbursement . It is needless to dilate on the importance of providing such new safeguards as are within the power of legislation to promote these ends , and I have little to add to the recommendations submitted in the accompanying papers . By law the terms of service of our most important collecting and disbursing officers in the civil departments are limited to four years , and when reappointed their bonds are required to be renewed . The safety of the public is much increased by this feature of the law , and there can be no doubt that its application to all officers intrusted with the collection or disbursement of the public money , whatever may be the tenure of their offices , would be equally beneficial . I therefore recommend , in addition to such of the suggestions presented by the heads of Departments as you may think useful , a general provision that all officers of the Army or Navy , or in the civil departments , intrusted with the receipt or payment of public money , and whose term of service is either unlimited or for a longer time than four years , be required to give new bonds , with good and sufficient sureties , at the expiration of every such period . A change in the period of terminating the fiscal year , from the 1st of October to the 1st of April , has been frequently recommended , and appears to be desirable . The distressing casualties in steamboats which have so frequently happened during the year seem to evince the necessity of attempting to prevent them by means of severe provisions connected with their customhouse papers . This subject was submitted to the attention of Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury in his last annual report , and will be again noticed at the present session , with additional details . It will doubtless receive that early and careful consideration which its pressing importance appears to require . Your attention has heretofore been frequently called to the affairs of the District of Columbia , and I should not again ask it did not their entire dependence on Congress give them a constant claim upon . its notice . Separated by the Constitution from the rest of the Union , limited in extent , and aided by no legislature of its own , it would seem to be a spot where a wise and uniform system of local government might have been easily adopted . This District has , however , unfortunately been left to linger behind the rest of the Union . Its codes , civil and criminal , are not only very defective , but full of obsolete or inconvenient provisions . Being formed of portions of two States , discrepancies in the laws prevail in different parts of the territory , small as it is and although it was selected as the seat of the General Government , the site of its public edifices , the depository of its archives , and the residence of officers intrusted with large amounts of public property and the management of public business , yet it has never been subjected to or received that special and comprehensive legislation which these circumstances peculiarly demand . I am well aware of the various subjects of greater magnitude and immediate interest that press themselves on the consideration of Congress , but I believe there is not one that appeals more directly to its justice than a liberal and even generous attention to the interests of the District of Columbia and a thorough and careful revision of its local government .<speech_sep>
