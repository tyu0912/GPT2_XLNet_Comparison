Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The letter herewith transmitted will inform you that it has pleased Divine Providence to remove from this life our excellent fellow citizen , George Washington , by the purity of his character and a long series of services to his country rendered illustrious through the world . It remains for an affectionate and grateful people , in whose hearts he can never die , to pay suitable honors to his memory . JOHN ADAMS . MOUNT VERNODecember 15 , 1799 . The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . SIIt is with inexpressible grief that I have to announce to you the death of the great and good General Washington . He died last evening between 10 and 11 of the clock , after a short illness of about twenty hours . His disorder was an inflamatory sore throat , which proceeded from a cold of which he made but little complaint on Friday . On Saturday morning about 3 of the clock he became ill . Craik attended him in the morning , and Dick , of Alexandria , and Brown , of Port Tobacco , were soon after called in . Every medical assistance was offered , but without the desired effect . His last scene corresponded with the whole tenor of his life not a groan nor a complaint escaped him in extreme distress . With perfect resignation and in full possession of his reason , he closed his well spent life . I have the honor to be , with the highest respect , sir , your most obedient and very humble servant , TOBIAS LEAR . The Senate , having resolved to wait on the President of the United States to condole with him on the distressing event of the death of General George Washington , proceeded to the house of the President , when the President of the Senate , in their name , presented the address which had previously been agreed to , as follows The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES The Senate of the United States respectfully take leave , sir , to to you their deep regret for the loss their country sustains in the death of General George Washington . This event , so distressing to all our fellow citizens , must be peculiarly heavy to you , who have long been associated with him in deeds of patriotism . Permit us , sir , to mingle our tears with yours . On this occasion it is manly to weep . To lose such a man at such a crisis is no common calamity to the world . Our country mourns her father . The Almighty Disposer of Human Events has taken from us our greatest benefactor and ornament . It becomes us to submit with reverence to Him who maketh darkness His pavilion . With patriotic pride we review the life of our Washington and compare him with those of other countries who have been preeminent in fame . Ancient and modern names are diminished before him . Greatness and guilt have too often been allied , but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant . The destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue . It reproved the intemperance of their ambition and darkened the splendor of victory . The scene is closed , and we are no longer anxious lest misfortune should sully his glory . He has traveled on to the end of his journey and carried with him an increasing weight of honor . He has deposited it safely , where misfortune can not tarnish it , where malice can not blast it . Favored of Heaven , he departed without exhibiting the weakness of humanity . Magnanimous in death , the darkness of the grave could not obscure his brightness . Such was the man whom we deplore . Thanks to God , his glory is consummated . Washington yet lives on earth in his spotless example his spirit is in Heaven . Let his countrymen consecrate the memory of the heroic general , the patriotic statesman , and the virtuous sage . Let them teach their children never to forget that the fruit of his labors and his example are their inheritance . SAMUEL LIVERMORE , President of the Senate pro tempore . DECEMBER 23 , 1799 . To which the President replied as follows UNITED STATES , December 23 , 1799 . Gentlemen of the Senate I receive with the most respectful and affectionate sentiments in this impressive address the obliging expressions of your regard for the loss our country has sustained in the death of her most esteemed , beloved , and admired citizen . In the multitude of my thoughts and recollections on this melancholy event you will permit me only to say that I have seen him in the days of adversity , in some of the scenes of his deepest distress and most trying perplexities I have also attended him in his highest elevation and most prosperous felicity , with uniform admiration of his wisdom , moderation , and constancy . Among all our original associates in that memorable league of the continent in 1774 , which first expressed the sovereign will of a free nation in America , he was the only one remaining in the General Government . Although with a constitution more enfeebled than his at an age when he thought it necessary to prepare for retirement , I feel myself alone bereaved of my last brother yet I derive a strong consolation from the unanimous disposition which appears in all ages and classes to mingle their sorrows with mine on this common calamity to the world . The life of our Washington can not suffer by comparison with those of other countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame . The attributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to eclipse the majesty of those virtues which made him , from being a modest citizen , a more resplendent luminary . Misfortune , had he lived , could hereafter have sullied his glory only with those superficial minds who , believing that characters and actions are marked by success alone , rarely deserve to enjoy it . Malice could never blast his honor , and envy made him a singular exception to her universal rule . For himself , he had lived enough to life and to glory . For his fellow citizens , if their prayers could have been answered , he would have been immortal . For me , his departure is at a most unfortunate moment . Trusting , however , in the wise and righteous dominion of Providence over the passions of men and the results of their councils and actions , as well as over their lives , nothing remains for me but humble resignation . His example is now complete , and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates , citizens , and men , not only in the present age , but in future generations as long as our history shall be read . If a Trajan found a Pliny , a Marcus Aurelius can never want biographers , eulogists , or historians . JOHN ADAMS . The House of Representatives having resolved unanimously to wait on the President of the United States in condolence of this national calamity , the Speaker , attended by the House , withdrew to the house of the President , when the Speaker addressed the President as follows SIThe House of Representatives , penetrated with a sense of the irreparable loss sustained by the nation in the death of that great and good man , the illustrious and beloved Washington , wait on you , sir , to express their condolence on this melancholy and distressing event . To which the President replied as follows UNITED STATES December 19 , 1799 . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I receive with great respect and affection the condolence of the House of Representatives on the melancholy and affecting event in the death of the most illustrious and beloved personage which this country ever produced . I sympathize with you , with the nation , and with good men through the world in this irreparable loss sustained by us all . JOHN ADAMS .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives While with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensations of Divine Providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of our cities and towns have been visited , there is cause for gratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the seat of Government for the discharge of our important duties . But when we reflect that this fatal disorder has within a few years made repeated ravages in some of our principal sea ports , and with increased malignancy , and when we consider the magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and private business , whereby the national interests are deeply affected , I think it my duty to invite the Legislature of the Union to examine the expediency of establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws of the respective States for these being formed on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicated through the channels of commerce , there seems to be a necessity that Congress , who alone can regulate trade , should frame a system which , while it may tend to preserve the general health , may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue . While we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferers , we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Being our annual oblations of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessings of His providence . To the usual subjects of gratitude I can not omit to add one of the 1st importance to our well being and safety I mean that spirit which has arisen in our country against the menaces and aggression of a foreign nation . A manly sense of national honor , dignity , and independence has appeared which , if encouraged and invigorated by every branch of the Government , will enable us to view undismayed the enterprises of any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory . The course of the transactions in relation to the United States and France which have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made the subject of a future communication . That communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measures which have been taken by the Government of the United States toward an amicable adjustment of differences with that power . You will at the same time perceive that the French Government appears solicitous to impress the opinion that it is averse to a rupture with this country , and that it has in a qualified manner declared itself willing to receive a minister from the United States for the purpose of restoring a good understanding . It is unfortunate for professions of this kind that they should be expressed in terms which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualifications which a minister from the United States should possess , and that while France is asserting the existence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the differences which have arisen , the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the United States , of which so many demonstrative proofs have been given , should even be indirectly questioned . It is also worthy of observation that the decree of the Directory alleged to be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruisers on our commerce has not given , and can not give , any relief . It enjoins them to conform to all the laws of France relative to cruising and prizes , while these laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have so long , so justly , and so fruitlessly complained . The law of France enacted in January last , which subjects to capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter are of British fabric or produce , although the entire property belong to neutrals , instead of being rescinded has lately received a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal . While this law , which is an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks , continues in force those nations can see in the French Government only a power regardless of their essential rights , of their independence and sovereignty and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance . Hitherto , therefore , nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France which ought to change or relax our measures of defense . On the contrary , to extend and invigorate them is our true policy . We have no reason to regret that these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued , and in proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable situation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the full development of our energies and resources . But in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the necessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of peace . An efficient preparation for war can alone insure peace . It is peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly cultivated , and harmony between us and France may be restored at her option . But to send another minister without more determinate assurances that he would be received would be an act of humiliation to which the United States ought not to submit . It must therefore be left with France if she is indeed desirous of accommodation to take the requisite steps . The United States will steadily observe the maxims by which they have hitherto been governed . They will respect the sacred rights of embassy and with a sincere disposition on the part of France to desist from hostility , to make reparation for the injuries heretofore inflicted on our commerce , and to do justice in future , there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a friendly intercourse . In making to you this declaration I give a pledge to France and the world that the Executive authority of this country still adheres to the humane and pacific policy which has invariably governed its proceedings , in conformity with the wishes of the other branches of the Government and of the people of the United States . But considering the late manifestations of her policy toward foreign nations , I deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with her or not , vigorous preparations for war will be alike indispensable . These alone will give to us an equal treaty and insure its observance . Among the measures of preparation which appear expedient , I take the liberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment . The beneficial effects of the small naval armament provided under the acts of the last session are known and acknowledged . Perhaps no country ever experienced more sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we have derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense . We ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our Navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade . Such a naval force as it is doubtless in the power of the United States to create and maintain would also afford to them the best means of general defense by facilitating the safe transportation of troops and stores to every part of our extensive coast . To accomplish this important object , a prudent foresight requires that systematic measures be adopted for procuring at all times the requisite timber and other supplies . In what manner this shall be done I leave to your consideration . I will now advert , gentlemen , to some matters of less moment , but proper to be communicated to the National Legislature . After the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the Natchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commences his observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which terminated the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude . From thence he proceeded to run the boundary line between the United States and Spain . He was afterwards joined by the Spanish commissioner , when the work of the former was confirmed , and they proceeded together to the demarcation of the line . Recent information renders it probably that the Southern Indians , either instigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of suffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title had not been extinguished , have ere this time stopped the progress of the commissioners and considering the mischiefs which may result from continuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes , the great expense attending it , and that the boundaries which the commissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as the Indian title has been extinguished , it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our commissioner . The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation between the United States and His Britannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under the name of the river Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace , and forming a part of the boundary therein described , have finally decided that question . On the 25th of October they made their declaration that a river called Scoodiac , which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its northwestern quarter , was the true Croix intended in the treaty of peace , as far as its great fork , where one of its streams comes from the westward and the other from the northward , and that the latter stream is the continuation of the Croix to its source . This decision , it is understood , will preclude all contention among the individual claimants , as it seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch bound the grants of land which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments . A subordinate question , however , it has been suggested , still remains to be determined . Between the mouth of the Croix as now settled and what is usually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable islands . The commissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of these islands , and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of Fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary , but it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty . Such progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of captures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of the 7th article of the treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation between the United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the commissioners will be able to bring their business to a conclusion in August of the ensuing year . The commissioners acting under the 25th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of our citizens for losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between France and Spain . Various circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law for augmenting the military establishment , among these the desire of obtaining the fullest information to direct the best selection of officers . As this object will now be speedily accomplished , it is expected that the raising and organizing of the troops will proceed without obstacle and with effect . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be laid before you , accompanied with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to a recent period . It will afford you satisfaction to infer the great extent and solidity of the public resources from the prosperous state of the finances , notwithstanding the unexampled embarrassments which have attended commerce . When you reflect on the conspicuous examples of patriotism and liberality which have been exhibited by our mercantile fellow citizens , and how great a proportion of the public resources depends on their enterprise , you will naturally consider whether their convenience can not be promoted and reconciled with the security of the revenue by a revision of the system by which the collection is at present regulated . During your recess measures have been steadily pursued for effecting the valuations and returns directed by the act of the last session , preliminary to the assessment and collection of a direct tax . No other delays or obstacles have been experienced except such as were expected to arise from the great extent of our country and the magnitude and novelty of the operation , and enough has been accomplished to assure a fulfillment of the views of the Legislature . Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I can not close this address without once more adverting to our political situation and inculcating the essential importance of uniting in the maintenance of our dearest interests and I trust that by the temper and wisdom of your proceedings and by a harmony of measures we shall secure to our country that weight and respect to which it is so justly entitled .<speech_sep>It is with peculiar satisfaction that I meet the 6th Congress of the United States of America . Coming from all parts of the Union at this critical and interesting period , the members must be fully possessed of the sentiments and wishes of our constituents . The flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land and by sea the prosperity of our extended commerce , notwithstanding interruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the world the return of health , industry , and trade to those cities which have lately been afflicted with disease , and the various and inestimable advantages , civil and religious , which , secured under our happy frame of government , are continued to us unimpaired , demand of the whole American people sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity for the merciful dispensations of His providence . But while these numerous blessings are recollected , it is a painful duty to advert to the ungrateful return which has been made for them by some of the people in certain counties of Pennsylvania , where , seduced by the arts and misrepresentations of designing men , they have openly resisted the law directing the valuation of houses and lands . Such defiance was given to the civil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts by judicial process to enforce the execution of the law , and it became necessary to direct a military force to be employed , consisting of some companies of regular troops , volunteers , and militia , by whose zeal and activity , in cooperation with the judicial power , order and submission were restored and many of the offenders arrested . Of these , some have been convicted of misdemeanors , and others , charged with various crimes , remain to be tried . To give due effect to the civil administration of government and to insure a just execution of the laws , a revision and amendment of the judiciary system is indispensably necessary . In this extensive country it can not but happen that numerous questions respecting the interpretation of the laws and the rights and duties of officers and citizens must arise . On the one hand , the laws should be executed on the other , individuals should be guarded from oppression . Neither of these objects is sufficiently assured under the present organization of the judicial department . I therefore earnestly recommend the subject to your serious consideration . Persevering in the pacific and humane policy which had been invariably professed and sincerely pursued by the executive authority of the United States , when indications were made on the part of the French Republic of a disposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two countries , I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances by a nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of our country dictated , and which its moderation had given it a right to prescribe . The assurances which were required of the French government previous to the departure of our envoys have been given through their minister of foreign relations , and I have directed them to proceed on their mission to Paris . They have full power to conclude a treaty , subject to the constitutional advice and consent of the Senate . The characters of these gentlemen are sure pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with its honor or interest , nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or friendship to any other nation , will be stipulated . It appearing probable from the information I received that our commercial intercourse with some ports in the island of Domingo might safely be renewed , I took such steps as seemed to me expedient to ascertain that point . The result being satisfactory , I then , in conformity with the act of Congress on the subject , directed the restraints and prohibitions of that intercourse to be discontinued on terms which were made known by proclamation . Since the renewal of this intercourse our citizens trading to those ports , with their property , have been duly respected , and privateering from those ports has ceased . In examining the claims of British subjects by the commissioners at Philadelphia , acting under the sixth article of the treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation with Great Britain , a difference of opinion on points deemed essential in the interpretation of that article has arisen between the commissioners appointed by the United States and the other members of that board , from which the former have thought it their duty to withdraw . It is sincerely to be regretted that the execution of an article produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice should have been thus unavoidably interrupted . It is , however , confidently expected that the same spirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated will lead to satisfactory explanations . In consequence of the obstacles to the progress of the commission in Philadelphia , His Britannic Majesty has directed the commissioners appointed by him under the seventh article of the treaty relating to the British captures of American vessels to withdraw from the board sitting in London , but with the express declaration of his determination to fulfill with punctuality and good faith the engagements which His Majesty has contracted by his treaty with the United States , and that they will be instructed to resume their functions whenever the obstacles which impede the progress of the commission at Philadelphia shall be removed . It being in like manner my sincere determination , so far as the same depends on me , that with equal punctuality and good faith the engagements contracted by the United States in their treaties with His Britannic Majesty shall be fulfilled , I shall immediately instruct our minister at London to endeavor to obtain the explanation necessary to a just performance of those engagements on the part of the United States . With such dispositions on both sides , I can not entertain a doubt that all difficulties will soon be removed and that the two boards will then proceed and bring the business committed to them respectively to a satisfactory conclusion . The act of Congress relative to the seat of the government of the United States requiring that on the first Monday of December next it should be transferred from Philadelphia to the District chosen for its permanent seat , it is proper for me to inform you that the commissioners appointed to provide suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the President and of the public offices of the government have made a report of the state of the buildings designed for those purposes in the city of Washington , from which they conclude that the removal of the seat of government to that place at the time required will be practicable and the accommodation satisfactory . Their report will be laid before you . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the service of the ensuing year , together with an account of the revenue and expenditure , to be laid before you . During a period in which a great portion of the civilized world has been involved in a war unusually calamitous and destructive , it was not to be expected that the United States could be exempted from extraordinary burthens . Although the period is not arrived when the measures adopted to secure our country against foreign attacks can be renounced , yet it is alike necessary for the honor of the government and the satisfaction of the community that an exact economy should be maintained . I invite you , gentlemen , to investigate the different branches of the public expenditure . The examination will lead to beneficial retrenchments or produce a conviction of the wisdom of the measures to which the expenditure relates . Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives At a period like the present , when momentous changes are occurring and every hour is preparing new and great events in the political world , when a spirit of war is prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the interests of the United States have any connection , unsafe and precarious would be our situation were we to neglect the means of maintaining our just rights . The result of the mission to France is uncertain but however it may terminate , a steady perseverance in a system of national defense commensurate with our resources and the situation of our country is an obvious dictate of wisdom for , remotely as we are placed from the belligerent nations , and desirous as we are , by doing justice to all , to avoid offense to any , nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions will secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities of war or national degradation . As to myself , it is my anxious desire so to execute the trust reposed in me as to render the people of the United States prosperous and happy . I rely with entire confidence on your cooperation in objects equally your care , and that our mutual labors will serve to increase and confirm union among our fellow citizens and an unshaken attachment to our government .<speech_sep>
