Whereas the late wicked and treasonable insurrection against the just authority of the United States of sundry persons in the counties of Northampton , Montgomery , and Bucks , in the State of Pennsylvania , in the year 1799 , having been speedily suppressed without any of the calamities usually attending rebellion whereupon peace , order , and submission to the laws of the United States were restored in the aforesaid counties , and the ignorant , misguided , and misinformed in the counties have returned to a proper sense of their duty , whereby it is become unnecessary for the public good that any future prosecutions should be commenced or carried on against any person or persons by reason of their being concerned in the said insurrection Wherefore be it known that John Adams , President of the United States of America , have granted , and by these presents do grant , a full , free , and absolute pardon to all and every person or persons concerned in the said insurrection , excepting as hereinafter excepted , of all treasons , misprisions of treason , felonies , misdemeanors , and other crimes by them respectively done or committed against the United States in either of the said counties before the 12th day of March , in the year 1799 , excepting and excluding therefrom every person who now standeth indicted or convicted of any treason , misprision of treason , or other offense against the United States , whereby remedying and releasing unto all persons , except as before excepted , all pains and penalties incurred , or supposed to be incurred , for or on account of the premises . Given under my hand and the seal of the United States of America , at the city of Philadelphia , this 21st day of May , 1800 , and of the Independence of the said States the twenty fourth . JOHN ADAMS .<speech_sep>As the safety and prosperity of nations ultimately and essentially depend on the protection and the blessing of Almighty God , and the national acknowledgment of this truth is not only an indispensable duty which the people owe to Him , but a duty whose natural influence is favorable to the promotion of that morality and piety without which social happiness can not exist nor the blessings of a free government be enjoyed and as this duty , at all times incumbent , is so especially in seasons of difficulty or of danger , when existing or threatening calamities , the just judgments of God against prevalent iniquity , are a loud call to repentance and reformation and as the United States of America are at present placed in a hazardous and afflictive situation by the unfriendly disposition , conduct , and demands of a foreign power , evinced by repeated refusals to receive our messengers of reconciliation and peace , by depredation on our commerce , and the infliction of injuries on very many of our fellow citizens while engaged in their lawful business on the seas under these considerations it has appeared to me that the duty of imploring the mercy and benediction of Heaven on our country demands at this time a special attention from its inhabitants . I have therefore thought fit to recommend , and I do hereby recommend , that Wednesday , the 9th day of May next , be observed throughout the United States as a day of solemn humiliation , fasting , and prayer that the citizens of these States , abstaining on that day from their customary worldly occupations , offer their devout addresses to the Father of Mercies agreeably to those forms or methods which they have severally adopted as the most suitable and becoming that all religious congregations do , with the deepest humility , acknowledge before God the manifold sins and transgressions with which we are justly chargeable as individuals and as a nation , beseeching Him at the same time , of His infinite grace , through the Redeemer of the World , freely to remit all our offenses , and to incline us by His Holy Spirit to that sincere repentance and reformation which may afford us reason to hope for his inestimable favor and heavenly benediction that it be made the subject of particular and earnest supplication that our country may be protected from all the dangers which threaten it that our civil and religious privileges may be preserved inviolate and perpetuated to the latest generations that our public councils and magistrates may be especially enlightened and directed at this critical period that the American people may be united in those bonds of amity and mutual confidence and inspired with that vigor and fortitude by which they have in times past been so highly distinguished and by which they have obtained such invaluable advantages that the health of the inhabitants of our land may be preserved , and their agriculture , commerce , fisheries , arts , and manufactures be blessed and prospered that the principles of genuine piety and sound morality may influence the minds and govern the lives of every description of our citizens , and that the blessings of peace , freedom , and pure religion may be speedily extended to all the nations of the earth . And finally , I recommend that on the said day the duties of humiliation and prayer be accompanied by fervent thanksgiving to the Bestower of Every Good Gift , not only for His having hitherto protected and preserved the people of these United States in the independent enjoyment of their religious and civil freedom , but also for having prospered them in a wonderful progress of population , and for conferring on them many and great favors conducive to the happiness and prosperity of a nation . Given under my hand and the seal of the United States of America , at Philadelphia , this 23d day of March , 1798 , and of the Independence of the said States the twenty second . JOHN ADAMS . By the President TIMOTHY PICKERING , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>When it was first perceived , in early times , that no middle course for America remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims , men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country . Relying , however , on the purity of their intentions , the justice of their cause , and the integrity and intelligence of the people , under an overruling Providence which had so signally protected this country from the first , the representatives of this nation , then consisting of little more than half its present number , not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up , but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them , and launched into an ocean of uncertainty . The zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war , supplying the place of government , commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society . The Confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian and Helvetic confederacies , the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history , and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered . But reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day , it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable . Negligence of its regulations , inattention to its recommendations , if not disobedience to its authority , not only in individuals but in States , soon appeared with their melancholy consequences universal languor , jealousies and rivalries of States , decline of navigation and commerce , discouragement of necessary manufactures , universal fall in the value of lands and their produce , contempt of public and private faith , loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations , and at length in discontents , animosities , combinations , partial conventions , and insurrection , threatening some great national calamity . In this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by their usual good sense , presence of mind , resolution , or integrity . Measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty . The public disquisitions , discussions , and deliberations issued in the present happy Constitution of Government . Employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions , I first saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign country . Irritated by no literary altercation , animated by no public debate , heated by no party animosity , I read it with great satisfaction , as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts , as an experiment better adapted to the genius , character , situation , and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested . In its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most esteemed , and in some States , my own native State in particular , had contributed to establish . Claiming a right of suffrage , in common with my fellow citizens , in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity , as well as them and theirs , I did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions , in public and in private . It was not then , nor has been since , any objection to it in my mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent . Nor have I ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves , in the course of their experience , should see and feel to be necessary or expedient , and by their representatives in Congress and the State legislatures , according to the Constitution itself , adopt and ordain . Returning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years , I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things , and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the Constitution . The operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends , and from an habitual attention to it , satisfaction in its administration , and delight in its effects upon the peace , order , prosperity , and happiness of the nation I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it . What other form of government , indeed , can so well deserve our esteem and love There may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences , but this is very certain , that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing , more noble , majestic , or august , than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of Congress , of a Government in which the Executive authority , as well as that of all the branches of the Legislature , are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good . Can anything essential , anything more than mere ornament and decoration , be added to this by robes and diamonds Can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people For it is the people only that are represented . It is their power and majesty that is reflected , and only for their good , in every legitimate government , under whatever form it may appear . The existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people . And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs , not from power or riches , grandeur or glory , but from conviction of national innocence , information , and benevolence . In the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free , fair , virtuous , and independent elections . If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote , and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption , the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends , not of the nation for the national good . If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces , by fraud or violence , by terror , intrigue , or venality , the Government may not be the choice of the American people , but of foreign nations . It may be foreign nations who govern us , and not we , the people , who govern ourselves and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance . Such is the amiable and interesting system of government and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed which the people of America have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who , by a long course of great actions , regulated by prudence , justice , temperance , and fortitude , conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace , to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity , has merited the gratitude of his fellow citizens , commanded the highest praises of foreign nations , and secured immortal glory with posterity . In that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services , the gratitude of mankind , the happy fruits of them to himself and the world , which are daily increasing , and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year . His name may be still a rampart , and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark , against all open or secret enemies of his country s peace . This example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation . On this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence but as something may be expected , the occasion , I hope , will be admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference , upon principle , of a free republican government , formed upon long and serious reflection , after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth if an attachment to the Constitution of the United States , and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people , expressed in the mode prescribed in it if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual States and a constant caution and delicacy toward the State governments if an equal and impartial regard to the rights , interest , honor , and happiness of all the States in the Union , without preference or regard to a northern or southern , an eastern or western , position , their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools , colleges , universities , academies , and every institution for propagating knowledge , virtue , and religion among all classes of the people , not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes , and of society in all its forms , but as the only means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies , the spirit of sophistry , the spirit of party , the spirit of intrigue , the profligacy of corruption , and the pestilence of foreign influence , which is the angel of destruction to elective governments if a love of equal laws , of justice , and humanity in the interior administration if an inclination to improve agriculture , commerce , and manufacturers for necessity , convenience , and defense if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of America , and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us , and our citizens to be more friendly to them if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations , and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which has been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both Houses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and the public opinion , until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress if a personal esteem for the French nation , formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them , and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations if , while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of America and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved , an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellow citizens by whatever nation , and if success can not be obtained , to lay the facts before the Legislature , that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the Government and its constituents demand if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me , at all times and to all nations , and maintain peace , friendship , and benevolence with all the world if an unshaken confidence in the honor , spirit , and resources of the American people , on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it , founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life , and not obscured but exalted by experience and age and , with humble reverence , I feel it to be my duty to add , if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians , and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity among the best recommendations for the public service , can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes , it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without effect . With this great example before me , with the sense and spirit , the faith and honor , the duty and interest , of the same American people pledged to support the Constitution of the United States , I entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy , and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power . And may that Being who is supreme over all , the Patron of Order , the Fountain of Justice , and the Protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty , continue His blessing upon this nation and its Government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His providence .<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives Immediately after the adjournment of Congress at their last session in Philadelphia I gave directions , in compliance with the laws , for the removal of the public offices , records , and property . These directions have been executed , and the public officers have since resided and conducted the ordinary business of the Government in this place . I congratulate the people of the United States on the assembling of Congress at the permanent seat of their Government , and I congratulate you , gentlemen , on the prospect of a residence not to be changed . Although there is cause to apprehend that accommodations are not now so complete as might be wished , yet there is great reason to believe that this inconvenience will cease with the present session . It would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to assemble for the first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and imploring His blessing . May this territory be the residence of virtue and happiness In this city may that piety and virtue , that wisdom and magnanimity , that constancy and self government , which adorned the great character whose name it bears be forever held in veneration Here and throughout our country may simple manners , pure morals , and true religion flourish forever It is with you , gentlemen , to consider whether the local powers over the District of Columbia vested by the Constitution in the Congress of the United States shall be immediately exercised . If in your opinion this important trust ought now to be executed , you can not fail while performing it to take into view the future probable situation of the territory for the happiness of which you are about to provide . You will consider it as the capital of a great nation advancing with unexampled rapidity in arts , in commerce , in wealth , and in population , and possessing within itself those energies and resources which , if not thrown away or lamentably misdirected , will secure to it a long course of prosperity and self government . In compliance with a law of the last session of Congress , the officers and soldiers of the temporary army have been discharged . It affords real pleasure to recollect the honorable testimony they gave of the patriotic motives which brought them into the service of their country , by the readiness and regularity with which they returned to the station of private citizens . It is in every point of view of such primary importance to carry the laws into prompt and faithful execution , and to render that part of the administration of justice which the Constitution and laws devolve on the Federal courts as convenient to the people as may consist with their present circumstances , that I can not omit once more to recommend to your serious consideration the judiciary system of the United States . No subject is more interesting than this to the public happiness , and to none can those improvements which may have been suggested by experience be more beneficially applied . A treaty of amity and commerce with the King of Prussia has been concluded and ratified . The ratifications have been exchanged , and I have directed the treaty to be promulgated by proclamation . The difficulties which suspended the execution of the 6th article of our treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation with Great Britain have not yet been removed . The negotiation on this subject is still depending . As it must be fore the interest and honor of both nations to adjust this difference with good faith , I indulge confidently the expectation that the sincere endeavors of the Government of the United States to bring it to an amicable termination will not be disappointed . The envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary from the United States to France were received by the First Consul with the respect due to their character , and 3 persons with equal powers were appointed to treat with them . Although at the date of the last official intelligence the negotiation had not terminated , yet it is to be hoped that our efforts to effect an accommodation will at length meet with a success proportioned to the sincerity with which they have been so often repeated . While our best endeavors for the preservation of harmony with all nations will continue to be used , the experience of the world and our own experience admonish us of the insecurity of trusting too confidently to their success . We can not , without committing a dangerous imprudence , abandon those measures of self protection which are adapted to our situation and to which , notwithstanding our pacific policy , the violence and injustice of others may again compel us to resort . While our vast extent of sea coast , the commercial and agriculture habits of our people , the great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean , suggest the system of defense which will be most beneficial to ourselves , our distance from Europe and our resources for maritime strength will enable us to employ it with effect . Seasonable and systematic arrangements , so far as our resources will justify , for a navy adapted to defensive war , and which may in case of necessity be quickly brought into use , seem to be as much recommended by a wise and true economy as by a just regard for our future tranquillity , for the safety of our shores , and for the protection of our property committed to the ocean . The present Navy of the United States , called suddenly into existence by a great national exigency , has raised us in our own esteem , and by the protection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our expectations the objects for which it was created . In connection with a navy ought to be contemplated the fortification of some of our principal sea ports and harbors . A variety of considerations , which will readily suggest themselves , urge an attention to this measure of precaution . To give security to our principal ports considerable sums have already been expended , but the works remain incomplete . It is for Congress to determine whether additional appropriations shall be made in order to render competent to the intended purposes the fortifications which have been commenced . The manufacture of arms within the United States still invites the attention of the National Legislature . At a considerable expense to the public this manufacture has been brought to such a state of maturity as , with continued encouragement , will supersede the necessity of future importations from foreign countries . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the ensuing year , together with an account of the public revenue and expenditure to a late period , to be laid before you . I observe with much satisfaction that the product of the revenue during the present year has been more considerable than during any former equal period . This result affords conclusive evidence of the great resources of this country and of the wisdom and efficiency of the measures which have been adopted by Congress for the protection of commerce and preservation of public credit . Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives As one of the grand community of nations , our attention is irresistibly drawn to the important scenes which surround us . If they have exhibited an uncommon portion of calamity , it is the province of humanity to deplore and of wisdom to avoid the causes which may have produced it . If , turning our eyes homeward , we find reason to rejoice at the prospect which presents itself if we perceive the interior of our country prosperous , free , and happy if all enjoy in safety , under the protection of laws emanating only from the general will , the fruits of their own labor , we ought to fortify and cling to those institutions which have been the source of such real felicity and resist with unabating perseverance the progress of those dangerous innovations which may diminish their influence . To your patriotism , gentlemen , has been confided the honorable duty of guarding the public interests and while the past is to your country a sure pledge that it will be faithfully discharged , permit me to assure you that your labors to promote the general happiness will receive from me the most zealous cooperation .<speech_sep>
