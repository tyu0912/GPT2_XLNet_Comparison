The personal inconveniences to the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives in leaving their families and private affairs at this season of the year are so obvious that I the more regret the extraordinary occasion which has rendered the convention of Congress indispensable . It would have afforded me the highest satisfaction to have been able to congratulate you on a restoration of peace to the nations of Europe whose animosities have endangered our tranquillity but we have still abundant cause of gratitude to the Supreme Dispenser of National Blessings for general health and promising seasons , for domestic and social happiness , for the rapid progress and ample acquisitions of industry through extensive territories , for civil , political , and religious liberty . While other states are desolated with foreign war or convulsed with intestine divisions , the United States present the pleasing prospect of a nation governed by mild and equal laws , generally satisfied with the possession of the rights , neither envying the advantages nor fearing the power of other nations , solicitous only for the maintenance of order and justice and the preservation of liberty , increasing daily in their attachment to a system of government in proportion to their experience of its utility , yielding a ready and general obedience to laws flowing from the reason and resting on the only solid foundation the affections of the people . It is with extreme regret that I shall be obliged to turn your thoughts to other circumstances , which admonish us that some of these felicities may not be lasting . But if the tide of our prosperity is full and a reflux commencing , a vigilant circumspection becomes us , that we may meet our reverses with fortitude and extricate ourselves from their consequences with all the skill we possess and all the efforts in our power . In giving to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommending to their consideration such measures as appear to me to be necessary or expedient , according to my constitutional duty , the causes and the objects of the present extraordinary session will be explained . After the president of the United States received information that the French government had expressed serious discontents at some proceedings of the government of these states said to affect the interests of France , he thought it expedient to send to that country a new minister , fully instructed to enter on such amicable discussions and to give such candid explanations as might happily remove the discontents and suspicions of the French government and vindicate the conduct of the United States . For this purpose he selected from among his fellow citizens a character whose integrity , talents , experience , and services had placed him in the rank of the most esteemed and respected in the nation . The direct object of his mission was expressed in his letter of credence to the French republic , being to maintain that good understanding which from the commencement of the alliance had subsisted between the two nations , and to efface unfavorable impressions , banish suspicions , and restore that cordiality which was at once the evidence and pledge of a friendly union . And his instructions were to the same effect , faithfully to represent the disposition of the government and people of the United States their disposition being 1 to remove jealousies and obviate complaints by shewing that they were groundless , to restore that mutual confidence which had been so unfortunately and injuriously impaired , and to explain the relative interests of both countries and the real sentiments of his own . A minister thus specially commissioned it was expected would have proved the instrument of restoring mutual confidence between the two republics . The first step of the French government corresponded with that expectation . A few days before his arrival at Paris the French minister of foreign relations informed the American minister then resident at Paris of the formalities to be observed by himself in taking leave , and by his successor preparatory to his reception . These formalities they observed , and on the 9th of December presented officially to the minister of foreign relations , the one a copy of his letters of recall , the other a copy of his letters of credence . These were laid before the Executive Directory . Two days afterwards the minister of foreign relations informed the recalled American minister that the Executive Directory had determined not to receive another minister plenipotentiary from the United States until after the redress of grievances demanded of the American government , and which the French republic had a right to expect from it . The American minister immediately endeavored to ascertain whether by refusing to receive him it was intended that he should retire from the territories of the French republic , and verbal answers were given that such was the intention of the Directory . For his own justification he desired a written answer , but obtained none until toward the last of January , when , receiving notice in writing to quit the territories of the republic , he proceeded to Amsterdam , where he proposed to wait for instruction from this government . During his residence at Paris cards of hospitality were refused him , and he was threatened with being subjected to the jurisdiction of the minister of police but with becoming firmness he insisted on the protection of the law of nations due to him as the known minister of a foreign power . You will derive further information from his dispatches , which will be laid before you . As it is often necessary that nations should treat for the mutual advantage of their affairs , and especially to accommodate and terminate differences , and as they can treat only by ministers , the right of embassy is well known and established by the law and usage of nations . The refusal on the part of France to receive our minister is , then , the denial of a right but the receive him until we have acceded to their demands without discussion and without investigation is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends , nor as a sovereign state . With this conduct of the French government it will be proper to take into view the public audience given to the late minister of the United States on his taking leave of the Executive Directory . The speech of the president discloses sentiments more alarming than the refusal of a minister , because more dangerous to our independence and union , and at the same time studiously marked with indignities toward the government of the United States . It evinces a disposition to separate the people of the United States from the government , to persuade them that they have different affections , principles , and interests from those of their fellow citizens whom they themselves have chosen to manage their common concerns , and thus to produce divisions fatal to our peace . Such attempts ought to be repelled with a decision which shall convince France and the world that we are not a degraded people , humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority , fitted to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence , and regardless of national honor , character , and interest . I should have been happy to have thrown a veil over these transactions if it had been possible to conceal them but they have passed on the great theater of the world , in the face of all Europe and America , and with such circumstances of publicity and solemnity that they can not be disguised and will not soon be forgotten . They have inflicted a wound in the American breast . It is my sincere desire , however , that it may be healed . It is my sincere desire , and in this I presume I concur with you and with our constituents , to preserve peace and friendship with all nations and believing that neither the honor nor the interest of the United States absolutely forbid the repetition of advances for securing these desirable objects with France , I shall institute a fresh attempt at negotiation , and shall not fail to promote and accelerate an accommodation on terms compatible with the rights , duties , interests , and honor of the nation . If we have committed errors , and these can be demonstrated , we shall be willing on conviction to redress them and equal measures of justice we have a right to expect from France and every other nation . The diplomatic intercourse between the United States and France being at present suspended , the government has no means of obtaining official information from that country . Nevertheless , there is reason to believe that the Executive Directory passed a decree on the 2nd of March last contravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778 , injurious to our lawful commerce and endangering the lives of our citizens . A copy of this decree will be laid before you . While we are endeavoring to adjust all our differences with France by amicable negotiation , the progress of the war in Europe , the depredations on our commerce , the personal injuries to our citizens , and the general complexion of affairs render it my indispensable duty to recommend to your consideration effectual measures of defense . The commerce of the United States has become an interesting object of attention , whether we consider it in relation to the wealth and finances or the strength and resources of the nation . With a sea coast of near 2000 miles in extent , opening a wide field for fisheries , navigation , and commerce , a great portion of our citizens naturally apply their industry and enterprise to these objects . Any serious and permanent injury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorders . To prevent it from being undermined and destroyed it is essential that it receive an adequate protection . The naval establishment must occur to every man who considers the injuries committed on our commerce , the insults offered to our citizens , and the description of vessels by which these abuses have been practiced . As the sufferings of our mercantile and sea faring citizens can not be ascribed to the omission of duties demandable , considering the neutral situation of our country , they are to be attributed to the hope of impunity arising from a supposed inability on our part to afford protection . To resist the consequences of such impressions on the minds of foreign nations and to guard against the degradation and servility which they must finally stamp on the American character is an important duty of government . A naval power , next to the militia , is the natural defense of the United States . The experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that a moderate naval force , such as would be easily within the present abilities of the Union , would have been sufficient to have baffled many formidable transportations of troops from one state to another , which were then practiced . Our sea coasts , from their great extent , are more easily annoyed and more easily defended by a naval force than any other . With all the materials our country abounds in skill our naval architects and navigators are equal to any , and commanders and sea men will not be wanting . But although the establishment of a permanent system of naval defense appears to be requisite , I am sensible it can not be formed so speedily and extensively as the present crisis demands . Hitherto I have thought proper to prevent the sailing of armed vessels except on voyages to the East Indies , where general usage and the danger from pirates appeared to render the permission proper . Yet the restriction has originated solely from a wish to prevent collisions with the powers at war , contravening the act of Congress of June 1794 , and not from any doubt entertained by me of the policy and propriety of permitting our vessels to employ means of defense while engaged in a lawful foreign commerce . It remains for Congress to prescribe such regulations as will enable our sea faring citizens to defend themselves against violations of the law of nations , and at the same time restrain them from committing acts of hostility against the powers at war . In addition to this voluntary provision for defense by individual citizens , it appears to me necessary to equip the frigates , and provide other vessels of inferior force , to take under convoy such merchant vessels as shall remain unarmed . The greater part of the cruisers whose depredations have been most injurious have been built and some of them partially equipped in the United States . Although an effectual remedy may be attended with difficulty , yet I have thought it my duty to present the subject generally to your consideration . If a mode can be devised by the wisdom of Congress to prevent the resources of the United States from being converted into the means of annoying our trade , a great evil will be prevented . With the same view , I think it proper to mention that some of our citizens resident abroad have fitted out privateers , and others have voluntarily taken the command , or entered on board of them , and committed spoliations on the commerce of the United States . Such unnatural and iniquitous practices can be restrained only by severe punishments . But besides a protection of our commerce on the seas , I think it highly necessary to protect it at home , where it is collected in our most important ports . The distance of the United States from Europe and the well known promptitude , ardor , and courage of the people in defense of their country happily diminish the probability of invasion . Nevertheless , to guard against sudden and predatory incursions the situation of some of our principal sea ports demands your consideration . And as our country is vulnerable in other interests besides those of its commerce , you will seriously deliberate whether the means of general defense ought not to be increased by an addition to the regular artillery and cavalry , and by arrangements for forming a provisional army . With the same view , and as a measure which , even in a time of universal peace , ought not to be neglected , I recommend to your consideration a revision of the laws for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , to render that natural and safe defense of the country efficacious . Although it is very true that we ought not to involve ourselves in the political system of Europe , but to keep ourselves always distinct and separate from it if we can , yet to effect this separation , early , punctual , and continual information of the current chain of events and of the political projects in contemplation is no less necessary than if we were directly concerned in them . It is necessary , in order to the discovery of the efforts made to draw us into the vortex , in season to make preparations against them . However we may consider ourselves , the maritime and commercial powers of the world will consider the United States of America as forming a weight in that balance of power in Europe which never can be forgotten or neglected . It would not only be against our interest , but it would be doing wrong to half of Europe , at least , if we should voluntarily throw ourselves into either scale . It is a natural policy for a nation that studies to be neutral to consult with other nations engaged in the same studies and pursuits . At the same time that measures might be pursued with this view , our treaties with Prussia and Sweden , one of which is expired and the other near expiring , might be renewed . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives It is particularly your province to consider the state of the public finances , and to adopt such measures respecting them as exigencies shall be found to require . The preservation of public credit , the regular extinguishment of the public debt , and a provision of funds to defray any extraordinary expenses will of course call for your serious attention . Although the imposition of new burthens can not be in itself agreeable , yet there is no ground to doubt that the American people will expect from you such measures as their actual engagements , their present security , and future interests demand . Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The present situation of our country imposes an obligation on all the departments of government to adopt an explicit and decided conduct . In my situation an exposition of the principles by which my administration will be governed ought not be omitted . It is impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world what has been before observed , that endeavors have been employed to foster and establish a division between the government and people of the United States . To investigate the causes which have encouraged this attempt is not necessary but to repel , by decided and united councils , insinuations so derogatory to the honor and aggressions so dangerous to the Constitution , union , and even independence of the nation is an indispensable duty . It must not be permitted to be doubted whether the people of the United States will support the government established by their voluntary consent and appointed by their free choice , or whether , by surrendering themselves to the direction of foreign and domestic factions , in opposition to their own government , they will forfeit the honorable station they have hitherto maintained . For myself , having never been indifferent to what concerned the interests of my country , devoted the best part of my life to obtain and support its independence , and constantly witnessed the patriotism , fidelity , and perseverance of my fellow citizens on the most trying occasions , it is not for me to hesitate or abandon a cause in which my heart has been so long engaged . Convinced that the conduct of the government has been just and impartial to foreign nations , that those internal regulations which have been established by law for the preservation of peace are in their nature proper , and that they have been fairly executed , nothing will ever be done by me to impair the national engagements , to innovate upon principles which have been so deliberately and uprightly established , or to surrender in any manner the rights of the government . To enable me to maintain this declaration I rely , under God , with entire confidence on the firm and enlightened support of the national legislature and upon the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizens .<speech_sep>I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary , on account of the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia , to convene the National Legislature at some other place . This measure it was desirable to avoid , because it would occasion much public inconvenience and a considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants of this city , whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their fellow citizens . Therefore , after taking measures to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness , I postponed my determination , having hopes , now happily realized , that , without hazard to the lives or health of the members , Congress might assemble at this place , where it was next by law to meet . I submit , however , to your consideration whether a power to postpone the meeting of Congress , without passing the time fixed by the Constitution upon such occasions , would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794 . Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in Europe and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our citizens from injustice and violence at sea , we have , nevertheless , abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for interior tranquillity and personal security , for propitious seasons , prosperous agriculture , productive fisheries , and general improvements , and , above all , for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support our sovereignty , as well as our moral and our religious principles , against all open and secret attacks . Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked one in July , the other in August to join their colleague in Holland . I have received intelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland , from whence they all proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of September . Whatever may be the result of this mission , I trust that nothing will have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to a successful conclusion , on such equitable terms as may be compatible with the safety , honor and interest of the United States . nothing , in the mean time , will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasions the people of the United States have given such memorable proofs , and the exertion of those resources for national defense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their power . It may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the adjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary measures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the opening of your late extraordinary session . If that system was then prudent , it is more so now , as increasing depredations strengthen the reasons for its adoption . Indeed , whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France , and whether the war in Europe is or is not to continue , I hold it most certain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained . The state of society has so long been disturbed , the sense of moral and religious obligations so much weakened , public faith and national honor have been so impaired , respect to treaties has been so diminished , and the law of nations has lost so much of its force , while pride , ambition , avarice and violence have been so long unrestrained , there remains no reasonable ground on which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or defense will not be plundered . The commerce of the United States is essential , if not to their existence , at least to their comfort , their growth , prosperity , and happiness . The genius , character , and habits of the people are highly commercial . Their cities have been formed and exist upon commerce . Our agriculture , fisheries , arts , and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it . In short , commerce has made this country what it is , and it can not be destroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and distress . Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation . The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of commercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens . Under this view of our affairs , I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if I forbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our commerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the only sure means of preserving both . I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at the opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable information of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty respecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the demarcation of the line of limits , but by the latest authentic intelligence Spanish garrisons were still continued within our country , and the running of the boundary line had not been commenced . These circumstances are the more to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a manner injurious to the United States . Still , however , indulging the hope that the answers which have been given will remove the objections offered by the Spanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty , I have judged it proper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to run the line of limits . Further information on this subject will be communicated in the course of the session . In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier it is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate the affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual hostilities against the United States . Great activity has been exerted by those persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes residing within the territory of the United States to influence them to transfer their affections and force to a foreign nation , to form them into a confederacy , and prepare them for war against the United States . Although measures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights , to prevent Indian hostilities , and to preserve entire their attachment to the United States , it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to these measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such practices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be necessary . The commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to ascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace , met at Passamaquoddy Bay in 1796 October , and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the adjacent shores and islands , and , being of opinion that actual surveys of both rivers to their sources were necessary , gave to the agents of the two nations instructions for that purpose , and adjourned to meet at Boston in August . They met , but the surveys requiring more time than had been supposed , and not being then completed , the commissioners again adjourned , to meet at Providence , in the State of Rhode Island , in June next , when we may expect a final examination and decision . The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty met at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects for debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from citizens or inhabitants of the United States . Various causes have hitherto prevented any determinations , but the business is now resumed , and doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption . Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses and damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the commissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty . The sums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government . A considerable number of other claims , where costs and damages , and not captured property , were the only objects in question , have been decided by arbitration , and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have also been paid . The commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty with Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on the claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between Spain and France . Their sittings have been interrupted , but are now resumed . The United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects , upon the award of the commissioners acting under the 6th article of the treaty with Great Britain , and for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States and brought into their ports , or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the United States , upon the awards of the commissioners acting under the 7th article of the same treaty , it is necessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations . The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French Republic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable expenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their tribunals . The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been disbursed by the consuls of the United States . By means of the same captures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign countries , destitute of all means of subsistence , and the sick in particular have been exposed to grievous sufferings . The consuls have in these cases also advanced moneys for their relief . For these advances they reasonably expect reimbursements from the United States . The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment . The provisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are found to be inadequate and ineffectual . Another provision seems necessary to be added to the consular act . Some foreign vessels have been discovered sailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers . It seldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception , because they have no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea letters . Gentlemen of the House of Representatives It is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects which by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere the national debts and taxes . Since the decay of the feudal system , by which the public defense was provided for chiefly at the expense of individuals , the system of loans has been introduced , and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes sufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war the sums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of what have been called funding systems . The consequences arising from the continual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent their growth in our own . The national defense must be provided for as well as the support of Government but both should be accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes , and as little as possible by loans . The estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction be laid before you . Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives We are met together at a most interesting period . The situation of the principal powers of Europe are singular and portentous . Connected with some by treaties and with all by commerce , no important event there can be indifferent to us . Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not less for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor , safety , and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of wisdom and firmness . In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence .<speech_sep>
