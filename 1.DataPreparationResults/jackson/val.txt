To the Senate of the United States . GENTLEMEThe accompanying propositions , in the form of a treaty , have been recently sent to me by special messenger from the Choctaw Nation of Indians , and since it was received a protest against it has been forwarded . Both evince a desire to cede to the United States all their country east of the Mississippi , and both are here submitted . These measures are the voluntary acts of the Indians themselves . The Government was not represented in the councils which adopted them , nor had it any previous intimation that such steps were in contemplation . The Indians convened of their own accord , settled and executed the propositions contained in the treaty presented to me , and agreed to be bound by them if within three months they should receive the approbation of the President and Senate . The other measure is equally their own . It is certainly desirous , on various and very pressing accounts , as will appear from the accompanying documents , that some agreement should be concluded with the Indians by which an object so important as their removal beyond the territorial limits of the States may be effected . In settling the terms of such an agreement I am disposed to exercise the utmost liberality , and to concur in any which are consistent with the Constitution and not incompatible with the interests of the United States and their duties to the Indians . I can not , however , regard the terms proposed by the Choctaws to be in all respects of this character but desirous of concluding an arrangement upon such as are , I have drawn up the accompanying amendments , which I propose to offer to the Choctaws if they meet the approbation of the Senate . The conditions which they offer are such as , in my judgment , will be most likely to be acceptable to both parties and are liable to the fewest objections . Not being tenacious , though , on the subject , I will most cheerfully adopt any modifications which on a frank interchange of opinions my constitutional advisers may suggest and which I shall be satisfied are reconcilable with my official duties . With these views , I ask the opinion of the Senate upon the following questions Will the Senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with the Choctaw Nation according to the terms which they propose Or will the Senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with that tribe as modified by the alterations suggested by me If not , what further alteration or modification will the Senate propose I am fully aware that in thus resorting to the early practice of the Government , by asking the previous advice of the Senate in the discharge of this portion of my duties , I am departing from a long and for many years an unbroken usage in similar cases . But being satisfied that this resort is consistent with the provisions of the Constitution , that it is strongly recommended in this instance by considerations of expediency , and that the reasons which have led to the observance of a different practice , though very cogent in negotiations with foreign nations , do not apply with equal force to those made with Indian tribes , I flatter myself that it will not meet the disapprobation of the Senate . Among the reasons for a previous expression of the views of the Senate the following are stated as most prominent 1 . The Indians have requested that their propositions should be submitted to the Senate . 2 . The opinion of the Senate in relation to the terms to be proposed will have a salutary effect in a future negotiation , if one should be deemed proper . 3 . The Choctaw is one of the most numerous and powerful tribes within our borders , and as the conclusion of a treaty with them may have a controlling effect upon other tribes it is important that its terms should be well considered . Those now proposed by the Choctaws , though objectionable , it is believed are susceptible of modifications which will leave them conformable to the humane and liberal policy which the Government desires to observe toward the Indian tribes , and be at the same time acceptable to them . To be possessed of the views of the Senate on this important and delicate branch of our future negotiations would enable the President to act much more effectively in the exercise of his particular functions . There is also the best reason to believe that measures in this respect emanating from the united counsel of the treaty making power would be more satisfactory to the American people and to the Indians . It will be seen that the pecuniary stipulations are large and in bringing this subject to the consideration of the Senate I may be allowed to remark that the amount of money which may be secured to be paid should , in my judgment , be viewed as of minor importance . If a fund adequate to the object in view can be obtained from the lands which they cede , all the purposes of the Government should be regarded as answered . The great desideratum is the removal of the Indians and the settlement of the perplexing question involved in their present location a question in which several of the States of this Union have the deepest interest , and which , if left undecided much longer , may eventuate in serious injury to the Indians .<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives . GENTLEMEI have maturely considered the bill proposing to authorize a subscription of stock in the Maysville , Washington , Paris , and Lexington Turnpike Road Company , and now return the same to the House of Representatives , in which it originated , with my objections to its passage . Sincerely friendly to the improvement of our country by means of roads and canals , I regret that any difference of opinion in the mode of contributing to it should exist between us and if in stating this difference I go beyond what the occasion may be deemed to call for , I hope to find an apology in the great importance of the subject , an unfeigned respect for the high source from which this branch of it has emanated , and an anxious wish to be correctly understood by my constituents in the discharge of all my duties . Diversity of sentiment among public functionaries actuated by the same general motives , on the character and tendency of particular measures , is an incident common to all Governments , and the more to be expected in one which , like ours , owes its existence to the freedom of opinion , and must be upheld by the same influence . Controlled as we thus are by a higher tribunal , before which our respective acts will be canvassed with the indulgence due to the imperfections of our nature , and with that intelligence and unbiased judgment which are the true correctives of error , all that our responsibility demands is that the public good should be the measure of our views , dictating alike their frank expression and honest maintenance . In the message which was presented to Congress at the opening of its present session I endeavored to exhibit briefly my views upon the important and highly interesting subject to which our attention is now to be directed . I was desirous of presenting to the representatives of the several States in Congress assembled the inquiry whether some mode could not be devised which would reconcile the diversity of opinion concerning the powers of this Government over the subject of internal improvement , and the manner in which these powers , if conferred by the Constitution , ought to be exercised . The act which I am called upon to consider has , therefore , been passed with a knowledge of my views on this question , as these are expressed in the message referred to . In that document the following suggestions will be found After the extinction of the public debt it is not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory to the people of the Union will until a remote period , if ever , leave the Government without a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond what may be required for its current service . As , then , the period approaches when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease , the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of Congress and it may be fortunate for the country that it is yet to be decided . Considered in connection with the difficulties which have heretofore attended appropriations for purposes of internal improvement , and with those which this experience tells us will certainly arise whenever power over such subjects may be exercised by the General Government , it is hoped that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversified interests of the States and strengthen the bonds which unite them . Every member of the Union , in peace and in war , will be benefited by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of highways in the several States . Let us , then , endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all . That hitherto adopted has by many of our fellow citizens been deprecated as an infraction of the Constitution , while by others it has been viewed as inexpedient . All feel that it has been employed at the expense of harmony in the legislative councils . And adverting to the constitutional power of Congress to make what I considered a proper disposition of the surplus revenue , I subjoined the following remarks To avoid these evils it appears to me that the most safe , just , and federal disposition which could be made of the surplus revenue would be its apportionment among the several States according to their ratio of representation , and should this measure not be found warranted by the Constitution that it would be expedient to propose to the States an amendment authorizing it . The constitutional power of the Federal Government to construct or promote works of internal improvement presents itself in two points of view the first as bearing upon the sovereignty of the States within whose limits their execution is contemplated , if jurisdiction of the territory which they may occupy be claimed as necessary to their preservation and use the second as asserting the simple right to appropriate money from the National Treasury in aid of such works when undertaken by State authority , surrendering the claim of jurisdiction . In the first view the question of power is an open one , and can be decided without the embarrassments attending the other , arising from the practice of the Government . Although frequently and strenuously attempted , the power to this extent has never been exercised by the Government in a single instance . It does not , in my opinion , possess it and no bill , therefore , which admits it can receive my official sanction . But in the other view of the power the question is differently situated . The ground taken at an early period of the Government was that whenever money has been raised by the general authority and is to be applied to a particular measure , a question arises whether the particular measure be within the enumerated authorities vested in Congress . If it be , the money requisite for it may be applied to it if not , no such application can be made . The document in which this principle was first advanced is of deservedly high authority , and should be held in grateful remembrance for its immediate agency in rescuing the country from much existing abuse and for its conservative effect upon some of the most valuable principles of the Constitution . The symmetry and purity of the Government would doubtless have been better preserved if this restriction of the power of appropriation could have been maintained without weakening its ability to fulfill the general objects of its institution , an effect so likely to attend its admission , notwithstanding its apparent fitness , that every subsequent Administration of the Government , embracing a period of thirty out of the forty two years of its existence , has adopted a more enlarged construction of the power . It is not my purpose to detain you by a minute recital of the acts which sustain this assertion , but it is proper that I should notice some of the most prominent in order that the reflections which they suggest to my mind may be better understood . In the Administration of Jefferson we have two examples of the exercise of the right of appropriation , which in the considerations that led to their adoption and in their effects upon the public mind have had a greater agency in marking the character of the power than any subsequent events . I allude to the payment of 15 , 000 , 000 for the purchase of Louisiana and to the original appropriation for the construction of the Cumberland road , the latter act deriving much weight from the acquiescence and approbation of three of the most powerful of the original members of the Confederacy , expressed through their respective legislatures . Although the circumstances of the latter case may be such as to deprive so much of it as relates to the actual construction of the road of the force of an obligatory exposition of the Constitution , it must , nevertheless , be admitted that so far as the mere appropriation of money is concerned they present the principle in its most imposing aspect . No less than twenty three different laws have been passed , through all the forms of the Constitution , appropriating upward of 2 , 500 , 000 out of the National Treasury in support of that improvement , with the approbation of every President of the United States , including my predecessor , since its commencement . Independently of the sanction given to appropriations for the Cumberland and other roads and objects under this power , the Administration of Madison was characterized by an act which furnishes the strongest evidence of his opinion of its extent . A bill was passed through both Houses of Congress and presented for his approval , setting apart and pledging certain funds for constructing roads and canals and improving the navigation of water courses , in order to facilitate , promote , and give security to internal commerce among the several States and to render more easy and less expensive the means and provisions for the common defense . Regarding the bill as asserting a power in the Federal Government to construct roads and canals within the limits of the States in which they were made , he objected to its passage on the ground of its unconstitutionally , declaring that the assent of the respective States in the mode provided by the bill could not confer the power in question that the only cases in which the consent and cession of particular States can extend the power of Congress are those specified and provided for in the Constitution , and superadding to these avowals his opinion that a restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to cases which are to be provided for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of Congress all the great and most important measures of Government , money being the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into execution . I have not been able to consider these declarations in any other point of view than as a concession that the right of appropriation is not limited by the power to carry into effect the measure for which the money is asked , as was formerly contended . The views of Monroe upon this subject were not left to inference . During his Administration a bill was passed through both Houses of Congress conferring the jurisdiction and prescribing the mode by which the Federal Government should exercise it in the case of the Cumberland road . He returned it with objections to its passage , and in assigning them took occasion to say that in the early stages of the Government he had inclined to the construction that it had no right to expend money except in the performance of acts authorized by the other specific grants of power , according to a strict construction of them , but that on further reflection and observation his mind had undergone a change that his opinion then was that Congress have an unlimited power to raise money , and that in its appropriation they have a discretionary power , restricted only by the duty to appropriate it to purposes of common defense , and of general , not local , national , not State , benefit and this was avowed to be the governing principle through the residue of his Administration . The views of the last Administration are of such recent date as to render a particular reference to them unnecessary . It is well known that the appropriating power , to the utmost extent which had been claimed for it , in relation to internal improvements was fully recognized and exercised by it . This brief reference to known facts will be sufficient to show the difficulty , if not impracticability , of bringing back the operations of the Government to the construction of the Constitution set up in 1798 , assuming that to be its true reading in relation to the power under consideration , thus giving an admonitory proof of the force of implication and the necessity of guarding the Constitution with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedents which have not the sanction of its most plainly defined powers for although it is the duty of all to look to that sacred instrument instead of the statute book , to repudiate at all times encroachments upon its spirit , which are too apt to be effected by the conjuncture of peculiar and facilitating circumstances , it is not less true that the public good and the nature of our political institutions require that individual differences should yield to a well settled acquiescence of the people and confederated authorities in particular constructions of the Constitution on doubtful points . Not to concede this much to the spirit of our institutions would impair their stability and defeat the objects of the Constitution itself . The bill before me does not call for a more definite opinion upon the particular circumstances which will warrant appropriations of money by Congress to aid works of internal improvement , for although the extension of the power to apply money beyond that of carrying into effect the object for which it is appropriated has , as we have seen , been long claimed and exercised by the Federal Government , yet such grants have always been professedly under the control of the general principle that the works which might be thus aided should be of a general , not local , national , not State , character . A disregard of this distinction would of necessity lead to the subversion of the federal system . That even this is an unsafe one , arbitrary in its nature , and liable , consequently , to great abuses , is too obvious to require the confirmation of experience . It is , however , sufficiently definite and imperative to my mind to forbid my approbation of any bill having the character of the one under consideration . I have given to its provisions all the reflection demanded by a just regard for the interests of those of our fellow citizens who have desired its passage , and by the respect which is due to a coordinate branch of the Government , but I am not able to view it in any other light than as a measure of purely local character or , if it can be considered national , that no further distinction between the appropriate duties of the General and State Governments need be attempted , for there can be no local interest that may not with equal propriety be denominated national . It has no connection with any established system of improvements is exclusively within the limits of a State , starting at a point on the Ohio River and running out 60 miles to an interior town , and even as far as the State is interested conferring partial instead of general advantages . Considering the magnitude and importance of the power , and the embarrassments to which , from the very nature of the thing , its exercise must necessarily be subjected , the real friends of internal improvement ought not to be willing to confide it to accident and chance . What is properly national in its character or otherwise is an inquiry which is often extremely difficult of solution . The appropriations of one year for an object which is considered national may be rendered nugatory by the refusal of a succeeding Congress to continue the work on the ground that it is local . No aid can be derived from the intervention of corporations . The question regards the character of the work , not that of those by whom it is to be accomplished . Notwithstanding the union of the Government with the corporation by whose immediate agency any work of internal improvement is carried on , the inquiry will still remain , Is it national and conducive to the benefit of the whole , or local and operating only to the advantage of a portion of the Union But although I might not feel it to be my official duty to interpose the Executive veto to the passage of a bill appropriating money for the construction of such works as are authorized by the States and are national in their character , I do not wish to be understood as expressing an opinion that it is expedient at this time for the General Government to embark in a system of this kind and anxious that my constituents should be possessed of my views on this as well as on all other subjects which they have committed to my discretion , I shall state them frankly and briefly . Besides many minor considerations , there are two prominent views of the subject which have made a deep impression upon my mind , which , I think , are well entitled to your serious attention , and will , I hope , be maturely weighed by the people . From the official communication submitted to you it appears that if no adverse and unforeseen contingency happens in our foreign relations and no unusual diversion be made of the funds set apart for the payment of the national debt we may look with confidence to its entire extinguishment in the short period of four years . The extent to which this pleasing anticipation is dependent upon the policy which may be pursued in relation to measures of the character of the one now under consideration must be obvious to all , and equally so that the events of the present session are well calculated to awaken public solicitude upon the subject . By the statement from the Treasury Department and those from the clerks of the Senate and House of Representatives , herewith submitted , it appears that the bills which have passed into laws , and those which in all probability will pass before the adjournment of Congress , anticipate appropriations which , with the ordinary expenditures for the support of Government , will exceed considerably the amount in the Treasury for the year 1830 . Thus , whilst we are diminishing the revenue by a reduction of the duties on tea , coffee , and cocoa the appropriations for internal improvement are increasing beyond the available means of the Treasury . And if to this calculation be added the amounts contained in bills which are pending before the two Houses , it may be safely affirmed that 10 , 000 , 000 would not make up the excess over the Treasury receipts , unless the payment of the national debt be postponed and the means now pledged to that object applied to those enumerated in these bills . Without a well regulated system of internal improvement this exhausting mode of appropriation is not likely to be avoided , and the plain consequence must be either a continuance of the national debt or a resort to additional taxes . Although many of the States , with a laudable zeal and under the influence of an enlightened policy , are successfully applying their separate efforts to works of this character , the desire to enlist the aid of the General Government in the construction of such as from their nature ought to devolve upon it , and to which the means of the individual States are inadequate , is both rational and patriotic , and if that desire is not gratified now it does not follow that it never will be . The general intelligence and public spirit of the American people furnish a sure guaranty that at the proper time this policy will be made to prevail under circumstances more auspicious to its successful prosecution than those which now exist . But great as this object undoubtedly is , it is not the only one which demands the fostering care of the Government . The preservation and success of the republican principle rest with us . To elevate its character and extend its influence rank among our most important duties , and the best means to accomplish this desirable end are those which will rivet the attachment of our citizens to the Government of their choice by the comparative lightness of their public burthens and by the attraction which the superior success of its operations will present to the admiration and respect of the world . Through the favor of an overruling and indulgent Providence our country is blessed with general prosperity and our citizens exempted from the pressure of taxation , which other less favored portions of the human family are obliged to bear yet it is true that many of the taxes collected from our citizens through the medium of imposts have for a considerable period been onerous . In many particulars these taxes have borne severely upon the laboring and less prosperous classes of the community , being imposed on the necessaries of life , and this , too , in cases where the burthen was not relieved by the consciousness that it would ultimately contribute to make us independent of foreign nations for articles of prime necessity by the encouragement of their growth and manufacture at home . They have been cheerfully borne because they were thought to be necessary to the support of Government and the payment of the debts unavoidably incurred in the acquisition and maintenance of our national rights and liberties . But have we a right to calculate on the same cheerful acquiescence when it is known that the necessity for their continuance would cease were it not for irregular , improvident , and unequal appropriations of the public funds Will not the people demand , as they have a right to do , such a prudent system of expenditure as will pay the debts of the Union and authorize the reduction of every tax to as low a point as the wise observance of the necessity to protect that portion of our manufactures and labor whose prosperity is essential to our national safety and independence will allow When the national debt is paid , the duties upon those articles which we do not raise may be repealed with safety , and still leave , I trust , without oppression to any section of the country , an accumulating surplus fund which may be beneficially applied to some well digested system of improvement . Under this view the question as to the manner in which the Federal Government can or ought to embark in the construction of roads and canals , and the extent to which it may impose burthens on the people for these purposes , may be presented on its own merits , free of all disguise and of every embarrassment , except such as may arise from the Constitution itself . Assuming these suggestions to be correct , will not our constituents require the observance of a course by which they can be effected Ought they not to require it With the best disposition to aid , as far as I can conscientiously , in furtherance of works of internal improvement , my opinion is that the soundest views of national policy at this time point to such a course . Besides the avoidance of an evil influence upon the local concerns of the country , how solid is the advantage which the Government will reap from it in the elevation of its character How gratifying the effect of presenting to the world the sublime spectacle of a Republic of more than 12 , 000 , 000 happy people , in the fifty fourth year of her existence , after having passed through two protracted wars the one for the acquisition and the other for the maintenance of liberty free from debt and with all her immense resources unfettered What a salutary influence would not such an exhibition exercise upon the cause of liberal principles and free government throughout the world Would we not ourselves find in its effect an additional guaranty that our political institutions will be transmitted to the most remote posterity without decay A course of policy destined to witness events like these can not be benefited by a legislation which tolerates a scramble for appropriations that have no relation to any general system of improvement , and whose good effects must of necessity be very limited . In the best view of these appropriations , the abuses to which they lead far exceed the good which they are capable of promoting . They may be resorted to as artful expedients to shift upon the Government the losses of unsuccessful private speculation , and thus , by ministering to personal ambition and self aggrandizement , tend to sap the foundations of public virtue and taint the administration of the Government with a demoralizing influence . In the other view of the subject , and the only remaining one which it is my intention to present at this time , is involved the expediency of embarking in a system of internal improvement without a previous amendment of the Constitution explaining and defining the precise powers of the Federal Government over it , Assuming the right to appropriate money to aid in the construction of national works to be warranted by the contemporaneous and continued exposition of the Constitution , its insufficiency for the successful prosecution of them must be admitted by all candid minds . If we look to usage to define the extent of the right , that will be found so variant and embracing so much that has been overruled as to involve the whole subject in great uncertainty and to render the execution of our respective duties in relation to it replete with difficulty and embarrassment . It is in regard to such works and the acquisition of additional territory that the practice obtained its first footing . In most , if not all , other disputed questions of appropriation the construction of the Constitution may be regarded as unsettled if the right to apply money in the enumerated cases is placed on the ground of usage . This subject has been one of much , and , I may add , painful , reflection to me . It has bearings that are well calculated to exert a powerful influence upon our hitherto prosperous system of government , and which , on some accounts , may even excite despondency in the breast of an American citizen . I will not detain you with professions of zeal in the cause of internal improvements . If to be their friend is a virtue which deserves commendation , our country is blessed with an abundance of it , for I do not suppose there is an intelligent citizen who does not wish to see them flourish . But though all are their friends , but few , I trust , are unmindful of the means by which they should be promoted none certainly are so degenerate as to desire their success at the cost of that sacred instrument with the preservation of which is indissolubly bound our country s hopes . If different impressions are entertained in any quarter if it is expected that the people of this country , reckless of their constitutional obligations , will prefer their local interest to the principles of the Union , such expectations will in the end be disappointed or if it be not so , then indeed has the world but little to hope from the example of free government . When an honest observance of constitutional compacts can not be obtained from communities like ours , it need not be anticipated elsewhere , and the cause in which there has been so much martyrdom , and from which so much was expected by the friends of liberty , may be abandoned , and the degrading truth that man is unfit for self government admitted . And this will be the case if expediency be made a rule of construction in interpreting the Constitution . Power in no government could desire a better shield for the insidious advances which it is ever ready to make upon the checks that are designed to restrain its action . But I do not entertain such gloomy apprehensions . If it be the wish of the people that the construction of roads and canals should be conducted by the Federal Government , it is not only highly expedient , but indispensably necessary , that a previous amendment of the Constitution , delegating the necessary power and defining and restricting its exercise with reference to the sovereignty of the States , should be made . Without it nothing extensively useful can be effected . The right to exercise as much jurisdiction as is necessary to preserve the works and to raise funds by the collection of tolls to keep them in repair can not be dispensed with . The Cumberland road should be an instructive admonition of the consequences of acting without this right . Year after year contests are witnessed , growing out of efforts to obtain the necessary appropriations for completing and repairing this useful work . Whilst one Congress may claim and exercise the power , a succeeding one may deny it and this fluctuation of opinion must be unavoidably fatal to any scheme which from its extent would promote the interests and elevate the character of the country . The experience of the past has shown that the opinion of Congress is subject to such fluctuations . If it be the desire of the people that the agency of the Federal Government should be confined to the appropriation of money in aid of such undertakings , in virtue of State authorities , then the occasion , the manner , and the extent of the appropriations should be made the subject of constitutional regulation . This is the more necessary in order that they may be equitable among the several States , promote harmony between different sections of the Union and their representatives , preserve other parts of the Constitution from being undermined by the exercise of doubtful powers or the too great extension of those which are not so , and protect the whole subject against the deleterious influence of combinations to carry by concert measures which , considered by themselves , might meet but little countenance . That a constitutional adjustment of this power upon equitable principles is in the highest degree desirable can scarcely be doubted , nor can it fail to be promoted by every sincere friend to the success of our political institutions . In no government are appeals to the source of power in cases of real doubt more suitable than in ours . No good motive can be assigned for the exercise of power by the constituted authorities , while those for whose benefit it is to be exercised have not conferred it and may not be willing to confer it . It would seem to me that an honest application of the conceded powers of the General Government to the advancement of the common weal present a sufficient scope to satisfy a reasonable ambition . The difficulty and supposed impracticability of obtaining an amendment of the Constitution in this respect is , I firmly believe , in a great degree unfounded . The time has never yet been when the patriotism and intelligence of the American people were not fully equal to the greatest exigency , and it never will when the subject calling forth their interposition is plainly presented to them . To do so with the questions involved in this bill , and to urge them to an early , zealous , and full consideration of their deep importance , is , in my estimation , among the highest of our duties . A supposed connection between appropriations for internal improvement and the system of protecting duties , growing out of the anxieties of those more immediately interested in their success , has given rise to suggestions which it is proper I should notice on this occasion . My opinions on these subjects have never been concealed from those who had a right to know them . Those which I have entertained on the latter have frequently placed me in opposition to individuals as well as communities whose claims upon my friendship and gratitude are of the strongest character , but I trust there has been nothing in my public life which has exposed me to the suspicion of being thought capable of sacrificing my views of duty to private considerations , however strong they may have been or deep the regrets which they are capable of exciting . As long as the encouragement of domestic manufactures is directed to national ends it shall receive from me a temperate but steady support . There is no necessary connection between it and the system of appropriations . On the contrary , it appears to me that the supposition of their dependence upon each other is calculated to excite the prejudices of the public against both . The former is sustained on the grounds of its consistency with the letter and spirit of the Constitution , of its origin being , traced to the assent of all the parties to the original compact , and of its having the support and approbation of a majority of the people , on which account it is at least entitled to a fair experiment . The suggestions to which I have alluded refer to a forced continuance of the national debt by means of large appropriations as a substitute for the security which the system derives from the principles on which it has hitherto been sustained . Such a course would certainly indicate either an unreasonable distrust of the people or a consciousness that the system does not possess sufficient soundness for its support if left to their voluntary choice and its own merits . Those who suppose that any policy thus rounded can be long upheld in this country have looked upon its history with eyes very different from mine . This policy , like every other , must abide the will of the people , who will not be likely to allow any device , however specious , to conceal its character and tendency . In presenting these opinions I have spoken with the freedom and candor which I thought the occasion for their expression called for , and now respectfully return the bill which has been under consideration for your further deliberation and judgment .<speech_sep>Having carefully and anxiously considered all the facts and arguments which have been submitted to him relative to a removal of the public deposits from the Bank of the United States , the President deems it his duty to communicate in this manner to his Cabinet the final conclusions of his own mind and the reasons on which they are founded , in order to put them in durable form and to prevent misconceptions . The President s convictions of the dangerous tendencies of the Bank of the United States , since signally illustrated by its own acts , were so overpowering when he entered on the duties of Chief Magistrate that he felt it his duty , notwithstanding the objections of the friends by whom he was surrounded , to avail himself of the first occasion to call the attention of Congress and the people to the question of its recharter . The opinions expressed in his annual message of December , 1829 , were reiterated in those of December , 1830 and 1831 , and in that of 1830 he threw out for consideration some suggestions in relation to a substitute . At the session of 1831 32 an act was passed by a majority of both Houses of Congress rechartering the present bank , upon which the President felt it his duty to put his constitutional veto . In his message returning that act he repeated and enlarged upon the principles and views briefly asserted in his annual message , declaring the bank to be , in his opinion , both inexpedient and unconstitutional , and announcing to his countrymen very unequivocally his firm determination never to sanction by his approval the continuance of that institution or the establishment of any other upon similar principles . There are strong reasons for believing that the motive of the bank in asking for a recharter at that session of Congress was to make it a leading question in the election of a President of the United States the ensuing November , and all steps deemed necessary were taken to procure from the people a reversal of the President s decision . Although the charter was approaching its termination , and the bank was aware that it was the intention of the Government to use the public deposit as fast as it has accrued in the payment of the public debt , yet did it extend its loans from January , 1831 , to May , 1832 , from 42 , 402 , 304 . 24 to 70 , 428 , 070 . 72 , being an increase of 28 , 025 , 766 . 48 in sixteen months . It is confidently believed that the leading object of this immense extension of its loans was to bring as large a portion of the people as possible under its power and influence , and it has been disclosed that some of the largest sums were granted on very unusual terms to the conductors of the public press . In some of these cases the motive was made manifest by the nominal or insufficient security taken for the loans , by the large amounts discounted , by the extraordinary time allowed for payment , and especially by the subsequent conduct of those receiving the accommodations . Having taken these preliminary steps to obtain control over public opinion , the bank came into Congress and asked a new charter . The object avowed by many of the advocates of the bank was to put the President to the test , that the country might know his final determination relative to the bank prior to the ensuing election . Many documents and articles were printed and circulated at the expense of the bank to bring the people to a favorable decision upon its pretensions . Those whom the bank appears to have made its debtors for the special occasion were warned of the ruin which awaited them should the President be sustained , and attempts were made to alarm the whole people by painting the depression in the price of property and produce and the general loss , inconvenience , and distress which it was represented would immediately follow the reelection of the President in opposition to the bank . Can it now be said that the question of a recharter of the bank was not decided at the election which ensued Had the veto been equivocal , or had it not covered the whole ground if it had merely taken exceptions to the details of the bill or to the time of its passage if it had not met the whole ground of constitutionality and expediency , then there might have been some plausibility for the allegation that the question was not decided by the people . It was to compel the President to take his stand that the question was brought forward at that particular time . He met the challenge , willingly took the position into which his adversaries sought to force him , and frankly declared his unalterable opposition to the bank as being both unconstitutional and inexpedient . On that ground the case was argued to the people and now that the people have sustained the President , notwithstanding the array of influence and power which was brought to bear upon him , it is too late , he confidently thinks , to say that the question has not been decided . Whatever may be the opinions of others , the President considers his reelection as a decision of the people against the bank . In the concluding paragraph of his veto message he said I have now done my duty to my country . If sustained by my fellow citizens , I shall be grateful and happy if not , I shall find in the motives which impel me ample grounds for contentment and peace . He was sustained by a just people , and he desires to evince his gratitude by carrying into effect their decision so far as it depends upon him . Of all the substitutes for the present bank which have been suggested , none seems to have united any considerable portion of the public in its favor . Most of them are liable to the same constitutional objections for which the present bank has been condemned , and perhaps to all there are strong objections on the score of expediency . In ridding the country of an irresponsible power which has attempted to control the Government , care must be taken not to unite the same power with the executive branch . To give a President the control over the currency and the power over individuals now possessed by the Bank of the United States , even with the material difference that he is responsible to the people , would be as objectionable and as dangerous as to leave it as it is . Neither one nor the other is necessary , and therefore ought not to be resorted to . On the whole , the President considers it as conclusively settled that the charter of the Bank of the United States will not be renewed , and he has no reasonable ground to believe that any substitute will be established . Being bound to regulate his course by the laws as they exist , and not to anticipate the interference of the legislative power for the purpose of framing new systems , it is proper for him seasonably to consider the means by which the services rendered by the Bank of the United States are to be performed after its charter shall expire . The existing laws declare that The deposits of the money of the United States in places in which the said bank and branches thereof may be established shall be made in said bank or branches thereof unless the Secretary of the Treasury shall at any time otherwise order and direct , in which case the Secretary of the Treasury shall immediately lay before Congress , if in session , and , if not , immediately after the commencement of the next session , the reasons of such order or direction . The power of the Secretary of the Treasury over the deposits is unqualified . The provision that he shall report his reasons to Congress is no limitation . Had it not been inserted he would have been responsible to Congress had he made a removal for any other than good reasons , and his responsibility now ceases upon the rendition of sufficient ones to Congress . The only object of the provision is to make his reasons accessible to Congress and enable that body the more readily to judge of their soundness and purity , and thereupon to make such further provision by law as the legislative power may think proper in relation to the deposit of the public money . Those reasons may be very diversified . It was asserted by the Secretary of the Treasury , without contradiction , as early as 1817 , that he had power to control the proceedings of the Bank of the United States at any moment by changing the deposits to the State banks should it pursue an illiberal course toward those institutions that the Secretary of the Treasury will always be disposed to support the credit of the State banks , and will invariably direct transfers from the deposits of the public money in aid of their legitimate exertions to maintain their credit and he asserted a right to employ the State banks when the Bank of the United States should refuse to receive on deposit the notes of such State banks as the public interest required should be received in payment of the public dues . In several instances he did transfer the public deposits to State banks in the immediate vicinity of branches , for reasons connected only with the safety of those banks , the public convenience , and the interests of the Treasury . If it was lawful for Crawford , the Secretary of the Treasury at that time , to act on these principles , it will be difficult to discover any sound reason against the application of similar principles in still stronger cases . And it is a matter of surprise that a power which in the infancy of the bank was freely asserted as one of the ordinary and familiar duties of the Secretary of the Treasury should now be gravely questioned , and attempts made to excite and alarm the public mind as if some new and unheard of power was about to be usurped by the executive branch of the Government . It is but a little more than two and a half years to the termination of the charter of the present bank . It is considered as the decision of the country that it shall then cease to exist , and no man , the President believes , has reasonable ground for expectation that any other Bank of the United States will be created by Congress . To the Treasury Department is intrusted the safe keeping and faithful application of the public moneys . A plan of collection different from the present must therefore be introduced and put in complete operation before the dissolution of the present bank . When shall it be commenced Shall no step be taken in this essential concern until the charter expires and the Treasury finds itself without an agent , its accounts in confusion , with no depository for its funds , and the whole business of the Government deranged , or shall it be delayed until six months , or a year , or two years before the expiration of the charter It is obvious that any new system which may be substituted in the place of the Bank of the United States could not be suddenly carried into effect on the termination of its existence without serious inconvenience to the Government and the people . Its vast amount of notes are then to be redeemed and withdrawn from circulation and its immense debt collected . These operations must be gradual , otherwise much suffering and distress will be brought upon the community . It ought to be not a work of months only , but of years , and the President thinks it can not , with due attention to the interests of the people , be longer postponed . It is safer to begin it too soon than to delay it too long . It is for the wisdom of Congress to decide upon the best substitute to be adopted in the place of the Bank of the United States , and the President would have felt himself relieved from a heavy and painful responsibility if in the charter to the bank Congress had reserved to itself the power of directing at its pleasure the public money to be elsewhere deposited , and had not devolved that power exclusively on one of the Executive Departments . It is useless now to inquire why this high and important power was surrendered by those who are peculiarly and appropriately the guardians of the public money . Perhaps it was an oversight . But as the President presumes that the charter to the bank is to be considered as a contract on the part of the Government , it is not now in the power of Congress to disregard its stipulations and by the terms of that contract the public money is to be deposited in the bank during the continuance of its charter unless the Secretary of the Treasury shall otherwise direct . Unless , therefore , the Secretary of the Treasury first acts , Congress have no power over the subject , for they can not add a new clause to the charter or strike one out of it without the consent of the bank , and consequently the public money must remain in that institution to the last hour of its existence unless the Secretary of the Treasury shall remove it at an earlier day . The responsibility is thus thrown upon the executive branch of the Government of deciding how long before the expiration of the charter the public interest will require the deposits to be placed elsewhere and although according to the frame and principle of our Government this decision would seem more properly to belong to the legislative power , yet as the law has imposed it upon the executive department the duty ought to be faithfully and firmly met , and the decision made and executed upon the best lights that can be obtained and the best judgment that can be formed . It would ill become the executive branch of the Government to shrink from any duty which the law imposes on it , to fix upon others the responsibility which justly belongs to itself . And while the President anxiously wishes to abstain from the exercise of doubtful powers and to avoid all interference with the rights and duties of others , he must yet with unshaken constancy discharge his own obligations , and can not allow himself to turn aside in order to avoid any responsibility which the high trust with which he has been honored requires him to encounter and it being the duty of one of the Executive Departments to decide in the first instance , subject to the future action of the legislative power , whether the public deposits shall remain in the Bank of the United States until the end of its existence or be withdrawn some time before , the President has felt himself bound to examine the question carefully and deliberately in order to make up his judgment on the subject , and in his opinion the near approach of the termination of the charter and the public considerations heretofore mentioned are of themselves amply sufficient to justify the removal of the deposits , without reference to the conduct of the bank or their safety in its keeping . But in the conduct of the bank may be found other reasons , very imperative in their character , and which require prompt action . Developments have been made from time to time of its faithlessness as a public agent , its misapplication of public funds , its interference in elections , its efforts by the machinery of committees to deprive the Government directors of a full knowledge of its concerns , and , above all , its flagrant misconduct as recently and unexpectedly disclosed in placing all the funds of the bank , including the money of the Government , at the disposition of the president of the bank as means of operating upon public opinion and procuring a new charter , without requiring him to render a voucher for their disbursement . A brief recapitulation of the facts which justify these charges , and which have come to the knowledge of the public and the President , will , he thinks , remove every reasonable doubt as to the course which it is now the duty of the President to pursue . We have seen that in sixteen months ending in May , 1832 , the bank had extended its loans more than 28 , 000 , 000 , although it knew the Government intended to appropriate most of its large deposit during that year in payment of the public debt . It was in May , 1832 , that its loans arrived at the maximum , and in the preceding March so sensible was the bank that it would not be able to pay over the public deposit when it would be required by the Government that it commenced a secret negotiation , without the approbation or knowledge of the Government , with the agents for about 2 , 700 , 000 of the 3 per cent stocks held in Holland , with a view of inducing them not to come forward for payment for one or more years after notice should be given by the Treasury Department . This arrangement would have enabled the bank to keep and use during that time the public money set apart for the payment of these stocks . After this negotiation had commenced , the Secretary of the Treasury informed the bank that it was his intention to pay off one half of the 3 percents on the 1st of the succeeding July , which amounted to about 6 , 500 , 000 . The president of the bank , although the committee of investigation was then looking into its affairs at Philadelphia , came immediately to Washington , and upon representing that the bank was desirous of accommodating the importing merchants at New York which it failed to do and undertaking to pay the interest itself , procured the consent of the Secretary , after consultation with the President , to postpone the payment until the succeeding 1st of October . Conscious that at the end of that quarter the bank would not be able to pay over the deposits , and that further indulgence was not to be expected of the Government , an agent was dispatched to England secretly to negotiate with the holders of the public debt in Europe and induce them by the offer of an equal or higher interest than that paid by the Government to hold back their claims for one year , during which the bank expected thus to retain the use of 5 , 000 , 000 of the public money , which the Government should set apart for the payment of that debt . The agent made an arrangement on terms , in part , which were in direct violation of the charter of the bank , and when some incidents connected with this secret negotiation accidentally came to the knowledge of the public and the Government , then , and not before , so much of it as was palpably in violation of the charter was disavowed . A modification of the rest was attempted with the view of getting the certificates without payment of the money , and thus absolving the Government from its liability to the holders . In this scheme the bank was partially successful , but to this day the certificates of a portion of these stocks have not been paid and the bank retains the use of the money . This effort to thwart the Government in the payment of the public debt that it might retain the public money to be used for their private interests , palliated by pretenses notoriously unfounded and insincere , would have justified the instant withdrawal of the public deposits . The negotiation itself rendered doubtful the ability of the bank to meet the demands of the Treasury , and the misrepresentations by which it was attempted to be justified proved that no reliance could be placed upon its allegations . If the question of a removal of the deposits presented itself to the Executive in the same attitude that it appeared before the House of Representatives at their last session , their resolution in relation to the safety of the deposits would be entitled to more weight , although the decision of the question of removal has been confided by law to another department of the Government . But the question now occurs attended by other circumstances and new disclosures of the most serious import . It is true that in the message of the President which produced this inquiry and resolution on the part of the House of Representatives it was his object to obtain the aid of that body in making a thorough examination into the conduct and condition of the bank and its branches in order to enable the executive department to decide whether the public money was longer safe in its hands . The limited power of the Secretary of the Treasury over the subject disabled him from making the investigation as fully and satisfactorily as it could be done by a committee of the House of Representatives , and hence the President desired the assistance of Congress to obtain for the Treasury Department a full knowledge of all the facts which were necessary to guide his judgment . But it was not his purpose , as the language of his message will show , to ask the representatives of the people to assume a responsibility which did not belong to them and relieve the executive branch of the Government from the duty which the law had imposed upon it . It is due to the President that his object in that proceeding should be distinctly understood , and that he should acquit himself of all suspicion of seeking to escape from the performance of his own duties or of desiring to interpose another body between himself and the people in order to avoid a measure which he is called upon to meet . But although as an act of justice to himself he disclaims any design of soliciting the opinion of the House of Representatives in relation to his own duties in order to shelter himself from responsibility under the sanction of their counsel , yet he is at all times ready to listen to the suggestions of the representatives of the people , whether given voluntarily or upon solicitation , and to consider them with the profound respect to which all will admit that they are justly entitled . Whatever may be the consequences , however , to himself , he must finally form his own judgment where the Constitution and the law make it his duty to decide , and must act accordingly and he is bound to suppose that such a course on his part will never be regarded by that elevated body as a mark of disrespect to itself , but that they will , on the contrary , esteem it the strongest evidence he can give of his fixed resolution conscientiously to discharge his duty to them and the country . A new state of things has , however , arisen since the close of the last session of Congress , and evidence has since been laid before the President which he is persuaded would have led the House of Representatives to a different conclusion if it had come to their knowledge . The fact that the bank controls , and in some cases substantially owns , and by its money supports some of the leading presses of the country is now more clearly established . Editors to whom it loaned extravagant sums in 1831 and 1832 , on unusual time and nominal security , have since turned out to be insolvent , and to others apparently in no better condition accommodations still more extravagant , on terms more unusual , and some without any security , have also been heedlessly granted . The allegation which has so often circulated through these channels that the Treasury was bankrupt and the bank was sustaining it , when for many years there has not been less on an average , than six millions of public money in that institution , might be passed over as a harmless misrepresentation but when it is attempted by substantial acts to impair the credit of the Government and tarnish the honor of the country , such charges require more serious attention . With six millions of public money in its vaults , after having had the use of from five to twelve millions for nine years without interest , it became the purchaser of a bill drawn by our Government on that of France for about 900 , 000 , being the first installment of the French indemnity . The purchase money was left in the use of the bank , being simply added to the Treasury deposit . The bank sold the bill in England , and the holder sent it to France for collection , and arrangements not having been made by the French Government for its payment , it was taken up by the agents of the bank in Paris with the funds of the bank in their hands . Under these circumstances it has through its organs openly assailed the credit of the Government , and has actually made and persists in a demand of 15 per cent , or 158 , 842 . 77 , as damages , when no damage , or none beyond some trifling expense , has in fact been sustained , and when the bank had in its own possession on deposit several millions of the public money which it was then using for its own profit . Is a fiscal agent of the Government which thus seeks to enrich itself at the expense of the public worthy of further trust There are other important facts not in the contemplation of the House of Representatives or not known to the members at the time they voted for the resolution . Although the charter and the rules of the bank both declare that not less than seven directors shall be necessary to the transaction of business , yet the most important business , even that of granting discounts to any extent , is intrusted to a committee of five members , who do not report to the board . To cut off all means of communication with the Government in relation to its most important acts at the commencement of the present year , not one of the Government directors was placed on any one committee and although since , by an unusual remodeling of those bodies , some of those directors have been placed on some of the committees , they are yet entirely excluded from the committee of exchange , through which the greatest and most objectionable loans have been made . When the Government directors made an effort to bring back the business of the bank to the board in obedience to the charter and the existing regulations , the board not only overruled their attempt , but altered the rule so as to make it conform to the practice , in direct violation of one of the most important provisions of the charter which gave them existence . It has long been known that the president of the bank , by his single will , originates and executes many of the most important measures connected with the management and credit of the bank , and that the committee as well as the board of directors are left in entire ignorance of many acts done and correspondence carried on in their names , and apparently under their authority . The fact has been recently disclosed that an unlimited discretion has been and is now vested in the president of the bank to expend its funds in payment for preparing and circulating articles and purchasing pamphlets and newspapers , calculated by their contents to operate on elections and secure a renewal of its charter . It appears from the official report of the public directors that on the 30th November , 1830 , the president submitted to the board an article published in the American Quarterly Review containing favorable notices of the bank , and suggested the expediency of giving it a wider circulation at the expense of the bank whereupon the board passed the following resolution , viz Resolved , That the president be authorized to take such measures in regard to the circulation of the contents of the said article , either in whole or in part , as he may deem most for the interest of the bank . By an entry in the minutes of the bank dated March 11 , 1831 , it appears that the president had not only caused a large edition of that article to be issued , but had also , before the resolution of 30th November was adopted , procured to be printed and widely circulated numerous copies of the reports of General Smith and McDuffie in favor of the bank and on that day he suggested the expediency of extending his power to the printing of other articles which might subserve the purposes of the institution , whereupon the following resolution was adopted , viz Resolved , That the president is hereby authorized to cause to be prepared and circulated such documents and papers as may communicate to the people information in regard to the nature and operations of the bank . The expenditures purporting to have been made under authority of these resolutions during the years 1831 and 1832 were about 80 , 000 . For a portion of these expenditures vouchers were rendered , from which it appears that they were incurred in the purchase of some hundred thousand copies of newspapers , reports and speeches made in Congress , reviews of the veto message and reviews of speeches against the bank , etc . For another large portion no vouchers whatever were rendered , but the various sums were paid on orders of the president of the bank , making reference to the resolution of the 11th of March , 1831 . On ascertaining these facts and perceiving that expenditures of a similar character were still continued , the Government directors a few weeks ago offered a resolution in the board calling for a specific account of these expenditures , showing the objects to which they had been applied and the persons to whom the money had been paid . This reasonable proposition was voted down . They also offered a resolution rescinding the resolutions of November , 1830 , and March , 1831 . This also was rejected . Not content with thus refusing to recall the obnoxious power or even to require such an account of the expenditure as would show whether the money of the bank had in fact been applied to the objects contemplated by these resolutions , as obnoxious as they were , the board renewed the power already conferred , and even enjoined renewed attention to its exercise by adopting the following in lieu of the propositions submitted by the Government directors , viz Resolved , That the board have confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the president and in the propriety of the resolutions of 30th November , 1830 , and 11th March , 1831 , and entertain a full conviction of the necessity of a renewed attention to the object of those resolutions , and that the president be authorized and requested to continue his exertions for the promotion of said object . Taken in connection with the nature of the expenditures heretofore made , as recently disclosed , which the board not only tolerate , but approve , this resolution puts the funds of the bank at the disposition of the president for the purpose of employing the whole press of the country in the service of the bank , to hire writers and newspapers , and to pay out such sums as he pleases to what person and for what services he pleases without the responsibility of rendering any specific account . The bank is thus converted into a vast electioneering engine , with means to embroil the country in deadly feuds , and , under cover of expenditures in themselves improper , extend its corruption through all the ramifications of society . Some of the items for which accounts have been rendered show the construction which has been given to the resolutions and the way in which the power it confers has been exerted . The money has not been expended merely in the publication and distribution of speeches , reports of committees , or articles written for the purpose of showing the constitutionality or usefulness of the bank , but publications have been prepared and extensively circulated containing the grossest invectives against the officers of the Government , and the money which belongs to the stockholders and to the public has been freely applied in efforts to degrade in public estimation those who were supposed to be instrumental in resisting the wishes of this gasping and dangerous institution . As the president of the bank has not been required to settle his accounts , no one but himself knows how much more than the sum already mentioned may have been squandered , and for which a credit may hereafter be claimed in his account under this most extraordinary resolution . With these facts before us can we be surprised at the torrent of abuse incessantly poured out against all who are supposed to stand in the way of the cupidity or ambition of the Bank of the United States Can we be surprised it sudden and unexpected changes of opinion in favor of an institution which has millions to lavish and avows its determination not to spare its means when they are necessary to accomplish its purposes The refusal to render an account of the manner in which a part of the money expended has been applied gives just cause for the suspicion that it has been used for purposes which it is not deemed prudent to expose to the eyes of an intelligent and virtuous people . Those who act justly do not shun the light , nor do they refuse explanations when the propriety of their conduct is brought into question . With these facts before him in an official report from the Government directors , the President would feel that he was not only responsible for all the abuses and corruptions the bank has committed or may commit , but almost an accomplice in a conspiracy against that Government which he has sworn honestly to administer , if he did not take every step within his constitutional and legal power likely to be efficient in putting an end to these enormities . If it be possible within the scope of human affairs to find a reason for removing the Government deposits and leaving the bank to its own resource for the means of effecting its criminal designs , we have it here . Was it expected when the moneys of the United States were directed to be placed in that bank that they would be put under the control of one man empowered to spend millions without rendering a voucher or specifying the object Can they be considered safe with the evidence before us that tens of thousands have been spent for highly improper , if not corrupt , purposes , and that the same motive may lead to the expenditure of hundreds of thousands , and even millions , more And can we justify ourselves to the people by longer lending to it the money and power of the Government to be employed for such purposes It has been alleged by some as an objection to the removal of the deposits that the bank has the power , and in that event will have the disposition , to destroy the State banks employed by the Government , and bring distress upon the country . It has been the fortune of the President to encounter dangers which were represented as equally alarming , and he has seen them vanish before resolution and energy . Pictures equally appalling were paraded before him when this bank came to demand a new charter . But what was the result Has the country been ruined , or even distressed Was it ever more prosperous than since that act The President verily believes the bank has not the power to produce the calamities its friends threaten . The funds of the Government will not be annihilated by being transferred . They will immediately be issued for the benefit of trade , and if the Bank of the United States curtails its loans the State banks , strengthened by the public deposits , will extend theirs . What comes in through one bank will go out through others , and the equilibrium will be preserved . Should the bank , for the mere purpose of producing distress , press its debtors more heavily than some of them can bear , the consequences will recoil upon itself , and in the attempts to embarrass the country it will only bring loss and ruin upon the holders of its own stock . But if the President believed the bank possessed all the power which has been attributed to it , his determination would only be rendered the more inflexible . If , indeed , this corporation now holds in its hands the happiness and prosperity of the American people , it is high time to take the alarm . If the despotism be already upon us and our only safety is in the mercy of the despot , recent developments in relation to his designs and the means he employs show how necessary it is to shake it off . The struggle can never come with less distress to the people or under more favorable auspices than at the present moment . All doubt as to the willingness of the State banks to undertake the service of the Government to the same extent and on the same terms as it is now performed by the Bank of the United States is put to rest by the report of the agent recently employed to collect information , and from that willingness their own safety in the operation may be confidently inferred . Knowing their own resources better than they can be known by others , it is not to be supposed that they would be willing to place themselves in a situation which they can not occupy without danger of annihilation or embarrassment . The only consideration applies to the safety of the public funds if deposited in those institutions , and when it is seen that the directors of many of them are not only willing to pledge the character and capital of the corporations in giving success to this measure , but also their own property and reputation , we can not doubt that they at least believe the public deposits would be safe in their management . The President thinks that these facts and circumstances afford as strong a guaranty as can be had in human affairs for the safety of the public funds and the practicability of a new system of collection and disbursement through the agency of the State banks . From all these considerations the President thinks that the State banks ought immediately to be employed in the collection and disbursement of the public revenue , and the funds now in the Bank of the United States drawn out with all convenient dispatch . The safety of the public moneys if deposited in the State banks must be secured beyond all reasonable doubts but the extent and nature of the security , in addition to their capital , if any be deemed necessary , is a subject of detail to which the Treasury Department will undoubtedly give its anxious attention . The banks to be employed must remit the moneys of the Government without charge , as the Bank of the United States now does must render all the services which that bank now performs must keep the Government advised of their situation by periodical returns in fine , in any arrangement with the State banks the Government must not in any respect be placed on a worse footing than it now is . The President is happy to perceive by the report of the agent that the banks which he has consulted have , in general , consented to perform the service on these terms , and that those in New York have further agreed to make payments in London without other charge than the mere cost of the bills of exchange . It should also be enjoined upon any banks which may be employed that it will be expected of them to facilitate domestic exchanges for the benefit of internal commerce to grant all reasonable facilities to the payers of the revenue to exercise the utmost liberality toward the other State banks , and do nothing uselessly to embarrass the Bank of the United States . As one of the most serious objections to the Bank of the United States is the power which it concentrates , care must be taken in finding other agents for the service of the Treasury not to raise up another power equally formidable . Although it would probably be impossible to produce such a result by any organization of the State banks which could be devised , yet it is desirable to avoid even the appearance . To this end it would be expedient to assume no more power over them and interfere no more in their affairs than might be absolutely necessary to the security of the public deposit and the faithful performance of their duties as agents of the Treasury . Any interference by them in the political contests of the country with a view to influence elections ought , in the opinion of the President , to be followed by an immediate discharge from the public service . It is the desire of the President that the control of the banks and the currency shall , as far as possible , be entirely separated from the political power of the country as well as wrested from an institution which has already attempted to subject the Government to its will . In his opinion the action of the General Government on this subject ought not to extend beyond the grant in the Constitution , which only authorizes Congress to coin money and regulate the value thereof all else belongs to the States and the people , and must be regulated by public opinion and the interests of trade . In conclusion , the President must be permitted to remark that he looks upon the pending question as of higher consideration than the mere transfer of a sum of money from one bank to another . Its decision may affect the character of our Government for ages to come . Should the bank be suffered longer to use the public moneys in the accomplishment of its purposes , with the proofs of its faithlessness and corruption before our eyes , the patriotic among our citizens will despair of success in struggling against its power , and we shall be responsible for entailing it upon our country forever . Viewing it as a question of transcendent importance , both in the principles and consequences it involves , the President could not , in justice to the responsibility which he owes to the country , refrain from pressing upon the Secretary of the Treasury his view of the considerations which impel to immediate action . Upon him has been devolved by the Constitution and the suffrages of the American people the duty of superintending the operation of the Executive Departments of the Government and seeing that the laws are faithfully executed . In the performance of this high trust it is his undoubted right to express to those whom the laws and his own choice have made his associates in the administration of the Government his opinion of their duties under circumstances as they arise . It is this right which he now exercises . Far be it from him to expect or require that any member of the Cabinet should at his request , order , or dictation do any act which he believes unlawful or in his conscience condemns . From them and from his fellow citizens in general he desires only that aid and support which their reason approves and their conscience sanctions . In the remarks he has made on this all important question he trusts the Secretary of the Treasury will see only the frank and respectful declarations of the opinions which the President has formed on a measure of great national interest deeply affecting the character and usefulness of his Administration , and not a spirit of dictation , which the President would be as careful to avoid as ready to resist . Happy will he be if the facts now disclosed produce uniformity of opinion and unity of action among the members of the Administration . The President again repeats that he begs his Cabinet to consider the proposed measure as his own , in the support of which he shall require no one of them to make a sacrifice of opinion or principle . Its responsibility has been assumed after the most mature deliberation and reflection as necessary to preserve the morals of the people , the freedom of the press , and the purity of the elective franchise , without which all will unite in saying that the blood and treasure expended by our forefathers in the establishment of our happy system of government will have been vain and fruitless . Under these convictions he feels that a measure so important to the American people can not be commenced too soon , and he therefore names the 1st day of October next as a period proper for the change of the deposits , or sooner , provided the necessary arrangements with the State banks can be made .<speech_sep>To the Senate of the United States I have received your resolution of the 15th instant , requesting me to inform the Senate whether the provisions of the act entitled An act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve peace on the frontiers , passed the 30th of March , 1802 , have been fully complied with on the part of the United States Government , and if they have not that he inform the Senate of the reasons that have induced the Government to decline the enforcement of said act , and I now reply to the same . According to my views of the act referred to , I am not aware of any omission to carry into effect its provisions in relation to trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes so far as their execution depended on the agency confided to the Executive . The numerous provisions of that act designed to secure to the Indians the peaceable possession of their lands may be reduced , substantially , to the following That citizens of the United States are restrained under sufficient penalties from entering upon the lands for the purpose of hunting thereon , or of settling them , or of giving their horses and cattle the benefit of a range upon them , or of traveling through them without a written permission and that the President of the United States is authorized to employ the military force of the country to secure the observance of these provisions . The authority to the President , however , is not imperative . The language is It shall be lawful for the president to take such measures and to employ such military force as he may judge necessary to remove from lands belonging to or secured by treaty to any Indian tribe any citizen who shall make a settlement thereon . By the nineteenth section of this act it is provided that nothing in it shall be construed to prevent any trade or intercourse with Indians living on lands surrounded by settlements of citizens of the United States and being within the ordinary jurisdiction of any of the individual States . This provision I have interpreted as being prospective in its operation and as applicable not only to Indian tribes which at the date of its passage were subject to the jurisdiction of any State , but to such also as should thereafter become so . To this construction of its meaning I have endeavored to conform , and have taken no step inconsistent with it . As soon , therefore , as the sovereign power of the State of Georgia was exercised by an extension of her laws throughout her limits , and I had received information of the same , orders were given to withdraw from the State the troops which had been detailed to prevent intrusion upon the Indian lands within it , and these orders were executed . The reasons which dictated them shall be frankly communicated . The principle recognized in the section last quoted was not for the first time then avowed . It is conformable to the uniform practice of the Government before the adoption of the Constitution , and amounts to a distinct recognition by Congress at that early day of the doctrine that that instrument had not varied the powers of the Federal Government over Indian affairs from what they were under the Articles of Confederation . It is not believed that there is a single instance in the legislation of the country in which the Indians have been regarded as possessing political rights independent of the control and authority of the States within the limits of which they resided . As early as the year 1782 the Journals of Congress will show that no claim of such a character was countenanced by that body . In that year the application of a tribe of Indians residing in South Carolina to have certain tracts of land which had been reserved for their use in that State secured to them free from intrusion , and without the right of alienating them even with their own consent , was brought to the consideration of Congress by a report from the Secretary of War . The resolution which was adopted on that occasion is as follows Resolved , That it be recommended to the legislature of South Carolina to take such measures for the satisfaction and security of said tribes as the said legislature in their wisdom may think fit . Here is no assertion of the right of Congress under the Articles of Confederation to interfere with the jurisdiction of the States over Indians within their limits , but rather a negation of it . They refused to interfere with the subject , and referred it under a general recommendation back to the State , to be disposed of as her wisdom might decide . If in addition to this act and the language of the Articles of Confederation anything further can be wanting to show the early views of the Government on the subject , it will be found in the proclamation issued by Congress in 1783 . It contains this language The United States in Congress assembled have thought proper to issue their proclamation , and they do hereby prohibit and forbid all persons front making settlements on lands inhabited or claimed by Indians without the limits or jurisdiction of any particular State . And again Resolved , That the preceding measures of Congress relative to Indian affairs shall not be construed to affect the territorial claims of any of the States or their legislative rights within their respective limits . It was not then pretended that the General Government had the power in their relations with the Indians to control or oppose the internal polity of the individual States of this Union , and if such was the case under the Articles of Confederation the only question on the subject since must arise out of some more enlarged power or authority given to the General Government by the present Constitution . Does any such exist Amongst the enumerated grants of the Constitution that which relates to this subject is expressed in these words Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes . In the interpretation of this power we ought certainly to be guided by what had been the practice of the Government and the meaning which had been generally attached to the resolves of the old Congress if the words used to convey it do not clearly import a different one , as far as it affects the question of jurisdiction in the individual States . The States ought not to be divested of any part of their antecedent jurisdiction by implication or doubtful construction . Tested by this rule it seems to me to be unquestionable that the jurisdiction of the States is left untouched by this clause of the Constitution , and that it was designed to give to the General Government complete control over the trade and intercourse of those Indians only who were not within the limits of any State . From a view of the acts referred to and the uniform practice of the Government it is manifest that until recently it has never been maintained that the right of jurisdiction by a State over Indians within its territory was subordinate to the power of the Federal Government . That doctrine has not been enforced nor even asserted in any of the States of New England where tribes of Indians have resided , and where a few of them yet remain . These tribes have been left to the undisturbed control of the States in which they were found , in conformity with the view which has been taken of the opinions prevailing up to 1789 and the clear interpretation of the act of 1802 . In the State of New York , where several tribes have resided , it has been the policy of the Government to avoid entering into quasi treaty engagements with them , barely appointing commissioners occasionally on the part of the United States to facilitate the objects of the State in its negotiations with them . The Southern States present an exception to this policy . As early as 1784 the settlements within the limits of North Carolina were advanced farther to the west than the authority of the State to enforce an obedience of its laws . Others were in a similar condition . The necessities , therefore , and not the acknowledged principles , of the Government must have suggested the policy of treating with the Indians in that quarter as the only practicable mode of conciliating their good will . The United States at that period had just emerged from a protracted war for the achievement of their independence . At the moment of its conclusion many of these tribes , as powerful as they were ferocious in their mode of warfare , remained in arms , desolating our frontier settlements . Under these circumstances the first treaties , in 1785 and 1790 , with the Cherokees , were concluded by the Government of the United States , and were evidently sanctioned as measures of necessity adapted to the character of the Indians and indispensable to the peace and security of the western frontier . But they can not be understood as changing the political relations of the Indians to the States or to the Federal Government . To effect this would have required the operation of quite a different principle and the intervention of a tribunal higher than that of the treaty making power . To infer from the assent of the Government to this deviation from the practice which had before governed its intercourse with the Indians , and the accidental forbearance of the States to assert their right of jurisdiction over them , that they had surrendered this portion of their sovereignty , and that its assumption now is usurpation , is conceding too much to the necessity which dictated those treaties , and doing violence to the principles of the Government and the rights of the States without benefiting in the least degree the Indians . The Indians thus situated can not be regarded in any other light than as members of a foreign government or of that of the State within whose chartered limits they reside . If in the former , the ordinary legislation of Congress in relation to them is not warranted by the Constitution , which was established for the benefit of our own , not of a foreign people . If in the latter , then , like other citizens or people resident within the limits of the States , they are subject to their jurisdiction and control . To maintain a contrary doctrine and to require the Executive to enforce it by the employment of a military force would be to place in his hands a power to make war upon the rights of the States and the liberties of the country a power which should be placed in the hands of no individual . If , indeed , the Indians are to be regarded as people possessing rights which they can exercise independently of the States , much error has arisen in the intercourse of the Government with them . Why is it that they have been called upon to assist in our wars without the privilege of exercising their own discretion If an independent people , they should as such be consulted and advised with but they have not been . In an order which was issued to me from the War Department in September , 1814 , this language is employed All the friendly Indians should be organized and prepared to cooperate with your other forces . There appears to be some dissatisfaction among the Choctaws their friendship and services should be secured without delay . The friendly Indians must be fed and paid , and made to fight when and where their services may be required . To an independent and foreign people this would seem to be assuming , I should suppose , rather too lofty a tone one which the Government would not have assumed if they had considered them in that light . Again , by the Constitution the power of declaring war belongs exclusively to Congress . We have been often engaged in war with the Indian tribes within our limits , but when have these hostilities been preceded or accompanied by an act of Congress declaring war against the tribe which was the object of them And was the prosecution of such hostilities an usurpation in each case by the Executive which conducted them of the constitutional power of Congress It must have been so , I apprehend , if these tribes are to be considered as foreign and independent nations . The steps taken to prevent intrusion upon Indian lands had their origin with the commencement of our Government , and became the subject of special legislation in 1802 , with the reservations which have been mentioned in favor of the jurisdiction of the States . With the exception of South Carolina , who has uniformly regulated the Indians within her limits without the aid of the General Government , they have been felt within all the States of the South without being understood to affect their rights or prevent the exercise of their jurisdiction , whenever they were in a situation to assume and enforce it . Georgia , though materially concerned , has on this principle forborne to spread her legislation farther than the settlements of her own white citizens , until she has recently perceived within her limits a people claiming to be capable of self government , sitting in legislative council , organizing courts and administering justice . To disarm such an anomalous invasion of her sovereignty she has declared her determination to execute her own laws throughout her limits a step which seems to have been anticipated by the proclamation of 1783 , and which is perfectly consistent with the nineteenth section of the act of 1802 . According to the language and reasoning of that section , the tribes to the South and the Southwest are not only surrounded by settlements of the citizens of the United States , but are now also within the ordinary jurisdiction of the individual States . They became so from the moment the laws of the State were extended over them , and the same result follows the similar determination of Alabama and Mississippi . These States have each a right to claim in behalf of their position now on this question the same respect which is conceded to the other States of the Union . Toward this race of people I entertain the kindest feelings , and am not sensible that the views which I have taken of their true interests are less favorable to them than those which oppose their emigration to the West . Years since I stated to them my belief that if the States chose to extend their laws over them it would not be in the power of the Federal Government to prevent it . My opinion remains the same , and I can see no alternative for them but that of their removal to the West or a quiet submission to the State laws . If they prefer to remove , the United States agree to defray their expenses , to supply them the means of transportation and a year s support after they reach their new homes a provision too liberal and kind to deserve the stamp of injustice . Either course promises them peace and happiness , whilst an obstinate perseverance in the effort to maintain their possessions independent of the State authority can not fail to render their condition still more helpless and miserable . Such an effort ought , therefore , to be discountenanced by all who sincerely sympathize in the fortunes of this peculiar people , and especially by the political bodies of the Union , as calculated to disturb the harmony of the two Governments and to endanger the safety of the many blessings which they enable us to enjoy . As connected with the subject of this inquiry , I beg leave to refer to the accompanying letter from the Secretary of War , inclosing the orders which proceeded from that Department , and a letter from the governor of Georgia .<speech_sep>I have attentively considered the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant , requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the Senate a copy of the paper which has been published , and which purports to have been read by him to the heads of the Executive Departments , dated the 18th day of September last , relating to the removal of the deposits of the public money from the Bank of the United States and its offices . The executive is a coordinate and independent branch of the Government equally with the Senate , and I have yet to learn under what constitutional authority that branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an account of any communication , either verbally or in writing , made to the heads of Departments acting as a Cabinet council . As well might I be required to detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held with those officers on any subject relating to their duties and my own . Feeling my responsibility to the American people , I am willing upon all occasions to explain to them the grounds of my conduct , and I am willing upon all proper occasions to give to either branch of the Legislature any information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the appropriate duties confided to them . Knowing the constitutional rights of the Senate , I shall be the last man under any circumstances to interfere with them . Knowing those of the Executive , I shall at all times endeavor to maintain them agreeably to the provisions of the Constitution and the solemn oath I have taken to support and defend it . I am constrained , therefore , by a proper sense of my own self respect and of the rights secured by the Constitution to the executive branch of the Government to decline a compliance with your request .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives In the discharge of my official duty the again devolves upon me of communicating with a new Congress . The reflection that the representation of the Union has been recently renewed , and that the constitutional term of its service will expire with my own , heightens the solicitude with which I shall attempt to lay before it the state of our national concerns and the devout hope which I cherish that its labors to improve them may be crowned with success . You are assembled at a period of profound interest to the American patriot . The unexampled growth and prosperity of our country having given us a rank in the scale of nations which removes all apprehension of danger to our integrity and independence from external foes , the career of freedom is before us , with an earnest from the past that if true to ourselves there can be no formidable obstacle in the future to its peaceful and uninterrupted pursuit . Yet , in proportion to the disappearance of those apprehensions which attended our weakness , as once contrasted with the power of some of the States of the Old World , should we now be solicitous as to those which belong to the conviction that it is to our own conduct we must look for the preservation of those causes on which depend the excellence and the duration of our happy system of government . In the example of other systems founded on the will of the people we trace to internal dissension the influences which have so often blasted the hopes of the friends of freedom . The social elements , which were strong and successful when united against external danger , failed in the more difficult task of properly adjusting their own internal organization , and thus gave way the great principle of self government . Let us trust that this admonition will never be forgotten by the Government or the people of the United States , and that the testimony which our experience thus far holds out to the great human family of the practicability and the blessings of free government will be confirmed in all time to come . We have but to look at the state of our agriculture , manufactures , and commerce and the unexampled increase of our population to feel the magnitude of the trust committed to us . Never in any former period of our history have we had greater reason than we now have to be thankful to Divine Providence for the blessings fo health and general prosperity . Every branch of labor we see crowned with the most abundant rewards . In every element of national resources and wealth and of individual comfort we witness the most rapid and solid improvements . With no interruptions to this pleasing prospect at home which will not yield to the spirit of harmony and good will that so strikingly pervades the mass of the people in every quarter , amidst all the diversity of interest and pursuits to which they are attached , and with no cause of solicitude in regard to our external affairs which will not , it is hoped , disappear before the principles of simple justice and the forbearance that mark our intercourse with foreign powers , we have every reason to feel proud of our beloved country . The general state of our foreign relations has not materially changed since my last annual message . In the settlement of the question of the North Eastern boundary little progress has been made . Great Britain has declined acceding to the proposition of the United States , presented in accordance with the resolution of the Senate , unless certain preliminary conditions were admitted , which I deemed incompatible with a satisfactory and rightful adjustment of the controversy . Waiting for some distinct proposal from the Government of Great Britain , which has been invited , I can only repeat the expression of my confidence that , with the strong mutual disposition which I believe exists to make a just arrangement , this perplexing question can be settled with a due regard to the well founded pretensions and pac ific policy of all the parties to it . Events are frequently occurring on the North Eastern frontier of a character to impress upon all the necessity of a speedy and definitive termination of the dispute . This consideration , added to the desire common to both to relieve the liberal and friendly relations so happily existing between the two countries from all embarrassment , will no doubt have its just influence upon both . Our diplomatic intercourse with Portugal has been renewed , and it is expected that the claims of our citizens , partially paid , will be fully satisfied as soon as the condition of the Queen s Government will permit the proper attention to the subject of them . That Government has , I am happy to inform you , manifested a determination to act upon the liberal principles which have marked our commercial policy . The happiest effects upon the future trade between the United States and Portugal are anticipated from it , and the time is not thought to be remote when a system of perfect reciprocity will be established . The installments due under the convention with the King of the Two Sicilies have been paid with that scrupulous fidelity by which his whole conduct has been characterized , and the hope is indulged that the adjustment of the vexed question of our claims will be followed by a more extended and mutually beneficial intercourse between the two countries . The internal contest still continues in Spain . Distinguished as this struggle has unhappily been by incidents of the most sanguinary character , the obligations of the late treaty of indemnification with us have been , never the less , faithfully executed by the Spanish Government . No provision having been made at the last session of Congress for the ascertainment of the claims to be paid and the apportionment of the funds under the convention made with Spain , I invite your early attention to the subject . The public evidences of the debt have , according to the terms of the convention and in the forms prescribed by it , been placed in the possession of the United States , and the interest as it fell due has been regularly paid upon them . Our commercial intercourse with Cuba stands as regulated by the act of Congress . No recent information has been received as to the disposition of the Government of Madrid , and the lamented death of our recently appointed minister on his way to Spain , with the pressure of their affairs at home , renders it scarcely probable that any change is to be looked for during the coming year . Further portions of the Florida archives have been sent to the United States , although the death of one of the commissioners at a critical moment embarrassed the progress of the delivery of them . The higher officers of the local government have recently shown an anxious desire , in compliance with the orders from the parent Government , to facilitate the selection and delivery of all we have a right to claim . Negotiations have been opened at Madrid for the establishment of a lasting peace between Spain and such of the Spanish American Governments of this hemisphere as have availed themselves of the intimation given to all of them of the disposition of Spain to treat upon the basis of their entire independence . It is to be regretted that simultaneous appointments by all of ministers to negotiate with Spain had not been made . The negotiation itself would have been simplified , and this long standing dispute , spreading over a large portion of the world , would have been brought to a more speedy conclusion . Our political and commercial relations with Austria , Prussia , Sweden , and Denmark stand on the usual favorable bases . One of the articles of our treaty with Russia in relation to the trade on the North West coast of America having expired , instructions have been given to our minister at Petersburg to negotiate a renewal of it . The long and unbroken amity between the two Governments gives every reason for supposing the article will be renewed , if stronger motives do not exist to prevent it than with our view of the subject can be anticipated here . I ask your attention to the message of my predecessor at the opening of the second session fo the 19th Congress , relative to our commercial intercourse with Holland , and to the documents connected with that subject , communicated to the House of Representatives on the 10th of January , 1825 , and 18th of January , 1827 . Coinciding in the opinion of my predecessor that Holland is not , under the regulations of her present system , entitled to have her vessels and their cargoes received into the United States on the footing of American vessels and cargoes as regards duties of tonnage and impost , a respect for his reference of it to the Legislature has alone prevented me from acting on the subject . I should still have waited without comment for the action of Congress , but recently a claim has been made by Belgian subjects to admission into our ports for their ships and cargoes on the same footing as American , with the allegation we could not dispute that our vessels received in their ports the identical treatment shewn to them in the ports of Holland , upon whose vessels no discrimination is made in the ports of the United States . Given the same privileges the Belgians expected the same benefits benefits that were , in fact , enjoyed when Belgium and Holland were united under one Government . Satisfied with the justice of their pretension to be placed on the same footing with Holland , I could not , never the less , without disregard to the principle of our laws , admit their claim to be treated as Americans , and at the same time a respect for Congress , to whom the subject had long since been referred , has prevented me from producing a just equality by taking from the vessels of Holland privileges conditionally granted by acts of Congress , although the condition upon which the grant was made has , in my judgment , failed since 1822 . I recommend , therefore , a review of the act of 1824 , and such modification of it as will produce an equality on such terms as Congress shall think best comports with our settled policy and the obligations of justice to two friendly powers . With the Sublime Porte and all the Governments on the coast of Barbary our relations continue to be friendly . The proper steps have been taken to renew our treaty with Morocco . The Argentine Republic has again promised to send within the current year a minister to the United States . A convention with Mexico for extending the time for the appointment of commissioners to run the boundary line has been concluded and will be submitted to the Senate . Recent events in that country have awakened the liveliest solicitude in the United States . Aware of the strong temptations existing and powerful inducements held out to the citizens of the United States to mingle in the dissensions of our immediate neighbors , instructions have been given to the district attorneys of the United States where indications warranted it to prosecute without respect to persons all who might attempt to violate the obligations of our neutrality , while at the same time it has been thought necessary to apprise the Government of Mexico that we should require the integrity of our territory to be scrupulously respected by both parties . From our diplomatic agents in Brazil , Chile , Peru , Central America , Venezuela , and New Granada constant assurances are received of the continued good understanding with the Governments to which they are severally accredited . With those Governments upon which our citizens have valid and accumulating claims , scarcely an advance toward a settlement of them is made , owing mainly to their distracted state or to the pressure of imperative domestic questions . Our patience has been and will probably be still further severely tried , but our fellow citizens whose interests are involved may confide in the determination of the Government to obtain for them eventually ample retribution . Unfortunately , many of the nations of this hemisphere are still self tormented by domestic dissensions . Revolution succeeds revolution injuries are committed upon foreigners engaged in lawful pursuits much time el apses before a government sufficiently stable is erected to justify expectation of redress ministers are sent and received , and before the discussions of past injuries are fairly begun fresh troubles arise but too frequently new injuries are added to the old , to be discussed together with the existing government after it has proved its ability to sustain the assaults made upon it , or with its successor if overthrown . If this unhappy condition of things continues much longer , other nations will be under the painful necessity of deciding whether justice to their suffering citizens does not require a prompt redress of injuries by their own power , without waiting for the establishment of a government competent and enduring enough to discuss and to make satisfaction for them . Since the last session of Congress the validity of our claims upon France , as liquidated by the treaty of 1831 , has been acknowledged by both branches of her legislature , and the money has been appropriated for their discharge but the payment is , I regret to inform you , still withheld . A brief recapitulation of the most important incidents in this protracted controversy will shew how utterly untenable are the grounds upon which this course is attempted to be justified . On entering upon the duties of my station I found the United States an unsuccessful applicant to the justice of France for the satisfaction of claims the validity of which was never questionable , and has now been most solemnly admitted by France herself . The antiquity of these claims , their high justice , and the aggravating circumstances out of which they arose are too familiar to the American people to require description . It is sufficient to say that for a period of 10 years and upward our commerce was , with but little interruption , the subject of constant aggression on the part of France aggressions the ordinary features of which were condemnations of vessels and cargoes under arbitrary decrees , adopted in contravention as well of the laws of nations as of treaty stipulations , burnings on the high seas , and seizures and confiscations under special imperial rescripts in the ports of other nations occupied by the armies or under the control of France . Such it is now conceded is the character of the wrongs we suffered wrongs in many cases so flagrant that even their authors never denied our right to reparation . Of the extent of these injuries some conception may be formed from the fact that after the burning of a large amount at sea and the necessary deterioration in other cases by long detention the American property so seized and sacrificed at forced sales , excluding what was adjudged to privateers before or without condemnation , brought into the French treasury upward of 24 , 000 , 000 francs , besides large custom house duties . The subject had already been an affair of 20 years uninterrupted negotiation , except for a short time when France was overwhelmed by the military power of united Europe . During this period , whilst other nations were extorting from her payment of their claims at the point of the bayonet , the United States intermitted their demand for justice out of respect to the oppressed condition of a gallant people to whom they felt under obligations for fraternal assistance in their own days of suffering and peril . The bad effects of these protracted and unavailing discussions , were obvious , and the line of duty was to my mind equally so . This was either to insist upon the adjustment of our claims within a reasonable period or to abandon them altogether . I could not doubt that by this course the interests and honor of both countries would be best consulted . Instructions were therefore given in this spirit to the minister who was sent out once more to demand reparation . Upon the meeting of Congress in December , 1829 , I felt it my duty to speak of these claims and the delays of France in terms calculated to call the serious attention of both countries to the subject . The then French ministry took exception to the message on the ground of its conataining a menace , under it was not agreeable to the French Government to negotiate . The American minister of his own accord refuted the construction which was attempted to be put upon the message and at the same time called to the recollection of the French ministry that the President s message was a communication addressed , not to foreign governments , but to the Congress of the United States , in which it was enjoined upon him by the Constitution to lay before that body information of the state of the Union , comprehending its foreign as well as its domestic relations , and that if in the discharge of this duty he felt it indumbent upon him to summon the attention of Congress in due time to what might be the possible consequences of existing difficulties with any foreign government , he might fairly be supposed to do so under a sense of his own Government , and not from any intention of holding a menace over a foreign power . The views taken by him received my approbation , the French Government was satisfied , and the negotiation was continued . It terminated in the treaty of July 4 , recognizing the justice of our claims in part and promising payment to the amount of 25 , 000 , 000 francs in 6 annual installments . The ratifications of this treaty were exchanged at Washington on the second of February , 1832 , and in 5 days thereafter it was laid before Congress , who immediately passed the acts necessary on our part to secure to France the commercial advantages conceded to her in the compact . The treaty had previously been solemnly ratified by the King of the French in terms which are certainly not mere matters of form , and of which the translation is as follows Wapproving the above convention in all and each of the dispositions which are contained in it , do declare , by ourselves as well as by our heirs and successors , that it is accepted , approved , ratified , and confirmed , and by these presents , signed by our hand , we do accept , approve , ratify , and confirm it promising , on the faith and word of a king , to observe it and to cause it to be observed inviolably , without ever contravening it or suffering it to be contravened , directly or indirectly , for any cause or under any pretense whatsoever . Official information of the exchange of ratifications in the United States reached Paris whilst the Chambers were in session . The extraordinary and to us injurious delays of the French Government in their action upon the subject of its fulfillment have been heretofore stated to Congress , and I have no disposition to enlarge upon them here . It is sufficient to observe that the then pending session was allowed to expire without even an effort to obtain the necessary appropriations that the two succeeding ones were also suffered to pass away without anything like a serious attempt to obtain a decision upon the subject , and that it was not until the fourth session , almost three years after the conclusion of the treaty and more than two years after the exchange of ratifications , that the bill for the execution of the treaty was pressed to a vote and rejected . In the mean time the Government of the United States , having full confidence that a treaty entered into and so solemnly ratified by the French King would be executed in good faith , and not doubting that provision would be made for the payment of the first installment which was to become due on the second day of February , 1833 , negotiated a draft for the amount through the Bank of the United States . When this draft was presented by the holder with the credentials required by the treaty to authorize him to receive the money , the Government of France allowed it to be protested . In addition to the injury in the nonpayment of the money by France , conformably to her engagement , the United States were exposed to a heavy claim on the part of the bank under pretense of damages , in satisfaction of which that institution seized upon and still retains an equal amount of the public money . Congress was in session when the decision of the Chambers reached Washington , and an immediate communication of this apparently final decision of France not to fulfill the stipulation of the treaty was the course naturally to be expected from the President . The deep tone of dissatisfaction which pervaded the public mind and the correspondent excitement produced in Congress by only a general knowledge of the result rendered it more than probable that a resort to immediate measures of redress would be the consequence of calling the attention of that body to the subject . Sincerely desirous of preserving the pacific relations which had so long existed between the two countries , I was anxious to avoid this course if I could be satisfied that by so neither the interests nor the honor of my country would be compromitted . Without the fullest assurances on that point , I could not hope to acquit myself of the responsibility to be incurred in suffering Congress to adjourn without laying the subject before them . Those received by me were believed to be of that character . That the feelings produced in the United States by the news of the rejection of the appropriation would be such as I have described them to have been was foreseen by the French Government , and prompt measures were taken by it to prevent the consequence . The King in person expressed through our minister at Paris his profound regret at the decision of the Chambers , and promised to send forthwith a ship with dispatches to his miniter here authorizing him to give such assurances as would satisfy the Government and people of the United States that the treaty would yet be faithfully executed by France . The national ship arrived , and the minister received his instructions . Claiming to act under the authority derived from them , he gave to this government in the name of his the most solemn assurances that as soon after the new elections as the charter would permit the French Chambers would be convened and the attempt to procure the necessary appropriations renewed that all the constitutional powers of the King and his ministers should be put in requisition to accomplish the object , and he was understood , and so expressly informed by this Government at the time , to engage that the question should be pressed to a decision at a period sufficiently early to permit information of the result to be communicated to Congress at the commencement of their next session . Relying upon these assurances , I incurred the responsibility , great as I regarded it to be , of suffering Congress to separate without communicating with them upon the subject . The expectations justly founded upon the promises thus solemnly made to this Government by that of France were not realized . The French Chambers met on the thirty first of July , 1834 , soon after the election , and although our minister in Paris urged the French ministry to bring the subject before them , they declined doing so . He next insisted that the Chambers , of prorogued without acting on the subject , should be reassembled at a period so early that their action on the treaty might be known in Washington prior to the meeting of Congress . This reasonable request was not only declined , but the Chambers were prorogued to the 29th of December , a day so late that their decision , however urgently pressed , could not in all probability be obtained in time to reach Washington before the necessary adjournment of Congress by the Constitution . The reasons given by the ministry for refusing to convoke the Chambers at an earlier period were afterwards shewn not to be insuperable by their actual convocation on the first of December under a special call for domestic purposes , which fact , however , did not become known to this Government until after the commencement of the last session of Congress . Thus disappointed in our just expectations , it became my imperative duty to consult with Congress in regard to the expediency of a resort to retaliatory measures in case the stipulations of the treaty should not be speedily complied with , and to recommend such as in my judgment the occasion c alled for . To this end an unreserved communication of the case in all its aspects became indispensable . To have shrunk in making it from saying all that was necessary to its correct understanding , and that the truth would justify , for fear of giving offense to others , would have been unworthy of us . To have gone , on the other hand , a single step further for the purpose of wounding the pride of a Government and people with whom we had so many motives for cultivating relations of amity and reciprocal advantage would have been unwise and improper . Admonished by the past of the difficulty of making even the simplest statement of our wrongs without disturbing the sensibilities of those who had by their position become responsible for their redress , and earnestly desirous of preventing further obstacles from that source , I went out of my way to preclude a construction of the message by which the recommendation that was made to Congress might be regarded as a menace to France in not only disavowing such a design , but in declaring that her pride and her power were too well known to expect anything from her fears . The message did not reach Paris until more than a month after the Chambers had been in session , and such was the insensibility of the ministry to our rightful claims and just expectations that our minister had been informed that the matter when introduced would not be pressed as a cabinet measure . Although the message was not officially communicated to the French Government , and not withstanding the declaration to the contrary which it contained , the French minstry decided to consider the conditional recommendation of reprisals a menace and an insult which the honor of the nation made it incumbent on them to resent . The measures resorted to by them to evince their sense of the supposed indignity were the immediate recall of their minister at Washington , the offer of passports to the American minister at Paris , and a public notice to the legislative Chambers that all diplomatic intercourse with the United States had been suspended . Having in this manner vindicated the dignity of France , they next proceeded to illustrate her justice . To this end a bill was immediately introduced into the Chamber of Deputies proposing to make the appropriations necessary to carry into effect the treaty . As this bill subsequently passed into a law , the provisions of which now constitute the main subject of difficulty between the two nations , it becomes my duty , in order to place the subject before you in a clear light , to trace the history of its passage and to refer with some particularity to the proceedings and discussions in regard to it . The minister of finance in his opening speech alluded to the measures which had been adopted to resent the supposed indignity , and recommended the execution of the treaty as a measure required by the honor and justice of France . He as the organ of the ministry declared the message , so long as it had not received the sanction of Congress , a mere expression of the personal opinion of the President , for which neither the Government nor people of the United States were responsible , and that an engagement had been entered into for the fulfillment of which the honor of France was pledged . Entertaining these views , the single condition which the French ministry proposed to annex to the payment of the money was that it should not be made until it was ascertained that the Government of the United States had done nothing to injure the interests of France , or , in other words , that no steps had been authorized by Congress of a hostile character toward France . What the disposition of action of Congress might be was then unknown to the French cabinet but on the 14th day of January the Senate resolved that it was at that time inexpedient to adopt any legislative measures in regard to the state of affairs between the United States and France , and no action on the subject had occurred in the House of Representatives . These facts were known in Paris prior to the 28th of March , 1835 , when the committee to whom the bill of indemnification had been referred reported it to the Chamber of Deputies . That committee substantially re echoed the sentiments of the ministry , declared that Congress had set aside the proposition of the President , and recommended the passage of the bill without any other restriction than that originally proposed . Thus was it known to the French ministry and Chambers that if the position assumed by them , and which had been so frequently and solemnly announced as the only one compatible with the honor of France , was maintained and the bill passed as originally proposed , the money would be paid and there would be an end of this unfortunate controversy . But this cheering prospect was soon destroyed by an amendment introduced into the bill at the moment of its passage , providing that the money should not be paid until the French Government had received satisfactory explanations of the President s message of the second December , 1834 , and , what is still more extraordinary , the president of the council of ministers adopted this amendment and consented to its incorporation in the bill . In regard to a supposed insult which had been formally resented by the recall of their minister and the offer of passports to ours , they now for the first time proposed to ask explanations . Sentiments and propositions which they had declared could not justly be imputed to the Government or people of the United States are set up as obstacles to the performance of an act of conceded justice to that Government and people . They had declared that the honor of France required the fulfillment of the engagement into which the King had entered , unless Congress adopted the recommendations of the message . They ascertained that Congress did not adopt them , and yet that fulfillment is refused unless they first obtain from the President explanations of an opinion characterized by themselves as personal and inoperative . The conception that it was my intention to menace or insult the Government of France is as unfounded as the attempt to extort from the fears of that nation what her sense of justice may deny would be vain and ridiculous . But the Constitution of the United States imposes on the President the duty of laying before Congress the condition of the country in its foreign and domestic relations , and of recommending such measures as may in his opinion be required by its interests . From the performance of this duty he can not be deterred by the fear of wounding the sensibilities of the people or government of whom it may become necessary to speak and the American people are incapble of submitting to an interference by any government on earth , however powerful , with the free performance of the domestic duties which the Constitution has imposed on their public functionaries . The discussions which intervene between the several departments of our Government being to ourselves , and for anything said in them our public servants are only responsible to their own constituents and to each other . If in the course of their consultations facts are erroneously stated or unjust deductions are made , they require no other inducement to correct them , however informed of their error , than their love of justice and what is due to their own character but they can never submit to be interrogated upon the subject as a matter of right by a foreign power . When our discussions terminate in acts , our responsibility to foreign powers commences , not as individuals , but as a nation . The principle which calls in question the President for the language of his message would equally justify a foreign power in demanding explanations of the language used in the report of a committee or by a member in debate . This is not the first time that the Government of France has taken exception to the messages of American Presidents . President Washington and the first President Adams in the performance of their duties to the American people fell under the animadversions of the French Directory . The obj ection taken by the ministry of Charles 10 , and removed by the explanation made by our minister upon the spot , has already been adverted to . When it was understood that the ministry of the present King took exception to my message of last year , putting a construction upon it which was disavowed on its face , our late minister at Paris , in answer to the note which first announced a dissatisfaction with the language used in the message , made a communication to the French Government under date of the 29th of January , 1835 , calculated to remove all impressions which an unreasonable susceptibility had created . He repeated and called the attention of the French Government to the disavowal contained in the message itself of any intention to intimidate by menace he truly declared that it contained and was intended to contain no charge of ill faith against the King of the French , and properly distinguished between the right to complain in unexceptionable terms of the omission to execute an agreement and an accusation of bad motives in withholding such execution , and demonstrated that the necessary use of that right ought not to be considered as an offensive imputation . Although this communication was made without instructions and entirely on the minister s own responsibility , yet it was afterwards made the act of this Government by my full approbation , and that approbation was officially made known on the 25th of April , 1835 , to the French Government . It , however , failed to have any effect . The law , after this friendly explanation , passed with the obnoxious amendment , supported by the King s ministers , and was finally approved by the King . The people of the United States are justly attached to a pacific system in their intercourse with foreign nations . It is proper , therefore , that they should know whether their Government has adhered to it . In the present instance it has been carried to the utmost extent that was consistent with a becoming self respect . The note of the 29th of January , to which I have before alluded , was not the only one which our minister took upon himself the responsibility of presenting on the same subject and in the same spirit . Finding that it was intended to make the payment of a just debt dependent on the performance of a condition which he knew could never be complied with , he thought it a duty to make another attempt to convince the French Government that whilst self respect and regard to the dignity of other nations would always prevent us from using any language that ought to give offense , yet we could never admit a right in any foreign government to ask explanations of or to interfere in any manner in the communications which one branch of our public councils made with another that in the present case no such language had been used , and that this had in a former note been fully and voluntarily state , before it was contemplated to make the explantion a condition and that there might be no misapprehension he stated the terms used in that note , and he officially informed them that it had been approved by the President , and that therefore every explanation which could reasonably be asked or honorably given had been already made that the contemplated measure had been anticipated by a voluntary and friendly declaration , and was therefore not only useless , but might be deemed offensive , and certainly would not be complied with if annexed as a condition . When this latter communication , to which I especially invite the attention of Congress , was laid before me , I entertained the hope that the means it was obviously intended to afford of an honorable and speedy adjustment of the difficulties between the two nations would have been accepted , and I therefore did not hesitate to give it my sanction and full approbation . This was due to the minister who had made himself responsible for the act , and it was published to the people of the United States and is now laid before their representatives to shew hos far their Executive has gone in its endeavors to restore a good understanding betwe en the two countries . It would have been at any time communicated to the Government of France had it been officially requested . The French Government having received all the explanation which honor and principle permitted , and which could in reason be asked , it was hoped it would no longer hesitate to pay the installments now due . The agent authorized to receive the money was instructed to inform the French minister of his readiness to do so . In reply to this notice he was told that the money could not then be paid , because the formalities required by the act of the Chambers had not been arranged . Not having received any official information of the intentions of the French Government , and anxious to bring , as far as practicable , this unpleasant affair to a close before the meeting of Congress , that you might have the whole subject before you , I caused our charge d affaires at Paris to be instructed to ask for the final determination of the French Government , and in the event of their refusal to pay the installments now due , without further explanations to return to the United States . The result of this last application has not yet reached us , but is daily expected . That it may be favorable is my sincere wish . France having now , through all the branches of her Government , acknowledged the validity of our claims and the obligation of the treaty of 1831 , and there really existing no adequate cause for further delay , will at length , it may be hoped , adopt the course which the interests of both nations , not less than the principles of justice , so imperiously require . The treaty being once executed on her part , little will remain to disturb the friendly relations of the two countries nothing , indeed , which will not yield to the suggestions of a pacific and enlightened policy and to the influence of that mutual good will and of those generous recollections which we may confidently expect will then be revived in all their ancient force . In any event , however , the principle involved in the new aspect which has been given to the controversy is so vitally important to the independent administration of the Government that it can neither be surrendered nor compromitted without national degradation . I hope it is unnecessary for me to say that such a sacrifice will not be made through any agency of mine . The honor of my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the statement of truth and the performance of duty nor can I give any explanation of my official acts except such as is due to integrity and justice and consistent with the principles on which our institutions have been framed . This determination will , I am confident , be approved by my constituents . I have , indeed , studied their character to but little purpose if the sum of 25 , 000 , 000 francs will have the weight of a feather in the estimation of what appertains to their national independence , and if , unhappily , a different impression should at any time obtain in any quarter , they will , I am sure , rally round the Government of their choice with alacrity and unanimity , and silence for ever the degrading imputation . Having thus frankly presented to you the circumstances which since the last session of Congress have occurred in this interesting and important matter , with the views of the Executive in regard to them , it is at this time only necessary to add that when ever the advices now daily expected from our chargyy d affaires shall have been received they will be made the subject of a special communication . The condition of the public finances was never more flattering than at the present period . Since my last annual communication all the remains of the public debt have been redeemed , or money has been placed in deposit for this purpose when ever the creditors choose to receive it . All the other pecuniary engagements of the Government have been honorably and promptly fulfilled , and there will be a balance in the Treasury at the close of the year of about 19 , 000 , 000 . It is believed that after meeting all outstanding and unexpended appropriations there will remain near 11 , 000 , 000 to be applied to any new objects which Congress may designate or to the more rapid execution of the works already in progress . In aid of these objects , and to satisfy the current expenditures of the ensuing year , it is estimated that there will be received from various sources 20 , 000 , 000 more in 1836 . Should Congress make new appropriations in conformity with the estimates which will be submitted from the proper Departments , amounting to about 24 , 000 , 000 , still the available surplus at the close of the next year , after deducting all unexpended appropriations , will probably not be less than 6 , 000 , 000 . This sum can , in my judgment , be now usefully applied to proposed improvements in our navy yards , and to new national works which are not enumerated in the present estimates or to the more rapid completion of those already begun . Either would be constitutional and useful , and would render unnecessary any attempt in our present peculiar condition to divide the surplus revenue or to reduce it any faster than will be effected by the existing laws . In any event , as the annual report from the Secretary of the Treasury will enter into details , shewing the probability of some decrease in the revenue during the next 7 years and a very considerable deduction in 1842 , it is not recommended that Congress should undertake to modify the present tariff so as to disturb the principles on which the compromise act was passed . Taxation on some of the articles of general consumption which are not in competition with our own productions may be no doubt so diminished as to lessen to some extent the source of this revenue , and the same object can also be assisted by more liberal provisions for the subjects of public defense , which in the present state of our prosperity and wealth may be expected to engage your attention . If , however , after satisfying all the demands which can arise from these sources the unexpended balance in the Treasury should still continue to increase , it would be better to bear with the evil until the great changes contemplated in our tariff laws have occurred and shall enable us to revise the system with that care and circumspection which are due to so delicate and important a subject . It is certainly our duty to diminish as far as we can the burdens of taxation and to regard all the restrictions which are imposed on the trade and navigation of our citizens as evils which we shall mitigate when ever we are not prevented by the adverse legislation and policy of foreign nations or those primary duties which the defense and independence of our country enjoin upon us . That we have accomplished much toward the relief of our citizens by the changes which have accompanied the payment of the public debt and the adoption of the present revenue laws is manifest from the fact that compared to 1833 there is a diminution of near 25 , 000 , 000 in the last two years , and that our expenditures , independently of those for the public debt , have been reduced near 9 , 000 , 000 during the same period . Let us trust that by the continued observance of economy and by harmonizing the great interests of agriculture , manufactures , and commerce much more may be accomplished to diminish the burdens of government and to increase still further the enterprise and the patriotic affection of all classes of our citizens and all the members of our happy Confederacy . As the data which the Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you in regard to our financial resources are full and extended , and will afford a safe guide in your future calculations , I think it unnecessary to offer any further observations on that subject here . Among the evidences of the increasing prosperity of the country , not the least gratifying is that afforded by the receipts from the sales of the public lands , which amount in the present year to the unexpected sum of 11 , 000 , 000 . This circumstance attests the rapidity with which agriculture , the first and most important occupation of man , advances and contributes to the wealth and power of our extended territory . Being still of the opinion that it is our best policy , as far as we can consistently with the obligations under which those lands were ceded to the United States , to promote their speedy settlement , I beg leave to call the attention of the present Congress to the suggestions I have offered respecting it in my former messages . The extraordinary receipts from the sales of the public lands invite you to consider what improvements the land system , and particularly the condition of the General Land Office , may require . At the time this institution was organized , near a quarter century ago , it would probably have been thought extravagant to anticipate for this period such an addition to its business as has been produced by the vast increase of those sales during the past and present years . It may also be observed that since the year 1812 the land offices and surveying districts have been greatly multiplied , and that numerous legislative enactments from year to year since that time have imposed a great amount of new and additional duties upon that office , while the want of a timely application of force commensurate with the care and labor required has caused the increasing embarrassment of accumulated arrears in the different branches of the establishment . These impediments to the expedition of much duty in the General Land Office induce me to submit to your judgment whether some modification of the laws relating to its organization , or an organization of a new character , be not called for at the present juncture , to enable the office to accomplish all the ends of its institution with a greater degree of facility and promptitude than experience has proved to be practicable under existing regulations . The variety of the concerns and the magnitude and complexity of the details occupying and dividing the attention of the Commissioner appear to render it difficult , if not impracticable , for that officer by any possible assiduity to bestow on all the multifarious subjects upon which he is called to act the ready and careful attention due to their respective importance , unless the Legislature shall assist him by a law providing , or enabling him to provide , for a more regular and economical distribution of labor , with the incident responsibility among those employed under his direction . The mere manual operation of affixing his signature to the vast number of documents issuing from his office subtracts so largely from the time and attention claimed by the weighty and complicated subjects daily accumulating in that branch of the public service as to indicate the strong necessity of revising the organic law of the establishment . It will be easy for Congress hereafter to proportion the expenditure on account of this branch of the service to its real wants by abolishing from time to time the offices which can be dispensed with . The extinction of the public debt having taken place , there is no longer any use for the offices of Commissioners of Loans and of the Sinking Fund . I recommend , therefore , that they be abolished , and that proper measures be taken for the transfer to the Treasury Department of any funds , books , and papers connected with the operations of those offices , and that the proper power be given to that Department for closing finally any portion of their business which may remain to be settled . It is also incumbent on Congress in guarding the pecuniary interests of the country to discontinue by such a law as was passed in 1812 the receipt of the bills of the Bank of the United States in payment of the public revenue , and to provide for the designation of an agent whose duty it shall be to take charge of the books and stock of the United States in that institution , and to close all connection with it after the 3d of March , 1836 1836 03 03 , when its charter expires . In making provision in regard to the disposition of this stock it will be essential to define clearly and strictly the duties and powers of the officer charged with that branch of the public service . It will be seen from the correspondence which the Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you that not withstanding the large amount of the stock which the United States hold in that institution no information has yet been communicated which will enable the Government to anticipate when it can receive any dividends or derive any benefit from it . Connected with the condition of the finances and the flourishing state of the country in all its branches of industry , it is pleasing to witness the advantages which have been already derived from the recent laws regulating the value of the gold coinage . These advantages will be more apparent in the course of the next year , when the branch mints authorized to be established in North Carolina , Georgia , and Louisiana shall have gone into operation . Aided , as it is hoped they will be , by further reforms in the banking systems of the States and by judicious regulations on the part of Congress in relation to the custody of the public moneys , it may be confidently anticipated that the use of gold and silver as circulating medium will become general in the ordinary transactions connected with the labor of the country . The great desideratum in modern times is an efficient check upon the power of banks , preventing that excessive issue of paper whence arise those fluctuations in the standard of value which render uncertain the rewards of labor . It was supposed by those who established the Bank of the United States that from the credit given to it by the custody of the public moneys and other privileges and the precautions taken to guard against the evils which the country had suffered in the bankruptcy of many of the State institutions of that period we should derive from that institution all the security and benefits of a sound currency and every good end that was attainable under the provision of the Constitution which authorizes Congress alone to coin money and regulate the value thereof . But it is scarcely necessary now to say that these anticipations have not been realized . After the extensive embarrassment and distress recently produced by the Bank of the United States , from which the country is now recovering , aggravated as they were by pretensions to power which defied the public authority , and which if acquiesced in by the people would have changed the whole character of our Government , every candid and intelligent individual must admit that for the attainment of the great advantages of a sound currency we must look to a course of legislation radically different from that which created such an institution . In considering the means of obtaining so important an end we must set aside all calculations of temporary convenience , and be influenced by those only which are in harmony with the true character and the permanent interests of the Republic . We must recur to first principles and see what it is that has prevented the legislation of Congress and the States on the subject of currency from satisfying the public expectation and realizing results corresponding to those which have attended the action of our system when truly consistent with the great principle of equality upon which it rests , and with that spirit of forbearance and mutual concession and generous patriotism which was originally , and must ever continue to be , the vital element of our Union . On this subject I am sure that I can not be mistaken in ascribing our want of success to the undue countenance which has been afforded to the spirit of monopoly . All the serious dangers which our system has yet encountered may be traced to the resort to implied powers and the use of corporations clothed with privileges , the effect of which is to advance the interests of the few at the expense of the many . We have felt but one class of these dangers exhibited in the contest waged by the Bank of the United States against the Government for the last four years . Happily they have been obviated for the present by the indignant resistance of the people , but we should recollect that the principle whence they sprung is an ever active one , which will not fail to renew its effo rts in the same and in other forms so long as there is a hope of success , founded either on the inattention of the people or the treachery of their representatives to the subtle progress of its influence . The bank is , in fact , but one of the fruits of a system at war with the genius of all our institutions a system founded upon a political creed the fundamental principle of which is a distrust of the popular will as a safe regulator of political power , and whose great ultimate object and inevitable result , should it prevail , is the consolidation of all power in our system in one central government . Lavish public disbursements and corporations with exclusive privileges would be its substitutes for the original and as yet sound checks and balances of the Constitution the means by whose silent and secret operation a control would be exercised by the few over the political conduct of the many by first acquiring that control over the labor and earnings of the great body of the people . Wherever this spirit has effected an alliance with political power , tyranny and despotism have been the fruit . If it is ever used for the ends of government , it has to be incessantly watched , or it corrupts the sources of the public virtue and agitates the country with questions unfavorable to the harmonious and steady pursuit of its true interests . We are now to see whether , in the present favorable condition of the country , we can not take an effectual stand against thei spirit of monopoly , and practically prove in respect to the currency as well as other important interests that ther is no necessity for so extensive a resort to it as that which has been heretofore practiced . The experience of another year has confirmed the utter fallacy of the idea that the Bank of the United States was necessary as a fiscal agent of the Government . Without its aid as such , indeed , in despite of all the embarrassment it was in its power to create , the revenue has been paid with punctuality by our citizens , the business of exchange , both foreign and domestic , has been conducted with convenience , and the circulating medium has been greatly improved . By the use of the State banks , which do not derive their charters from the General Government and are not controlled by its authority , it is ascertained that the moneys of the United States can be collected and disbursed without loss or inconvenience , and that all the wants of the community in relation to exchange and currency are supplied as well as they have ever been before . If under circumstances the most unfavorable to the steadiness of the money market it has been found that the considerations on which the Bank of the United States rested its claims to the public favor were imaginary and groundless , it can not be doubted that the experience of the future will be more decisive against them . It has been seen that without the agency of a great moneyed monopoly the revenue can be collected and conveniently and safely applied to all the purposes of the public expenditure . It is also ascertained that instead of being necessarily made to promote the evils of an unchecked paper system , the management of the revenue can be made auxiliary to the reform which the legislatures of several of the States have already commenced in regard to the suppression of small bills , and which has only to be fostered by proper regulations on the part of Congress to secure a practical return to the extent required for the security of the currency to the constitutional medium . Severed from the Government as political engines , and not susceptible of dangerous extension and combination , the State banks will not be tempted , nor will they have teh power , which we have seen exercised , to divert the public funds from the legitimate purposes of the Government . The collection and custody of the revenue , being , on the contrary , a source of credit to them , will increase the security which the States provide for a faithful execution of their trusts by multiplying the scrutinies to which their operations and accounts will be subjected . Thus disposed , as well from interest as the obligations of their charters , it can not be doubted that such conditions as Congress may see fit to adopt respecting the deposits in these institutions , with a view to the gradual disuse , of the small bills will be cheerfully complied with , and that we shall soon gain in place of the Bank of the United States a practical reform in the whole paper system of the country . If by this policy we can ultimately witness the suppression of all bank bills below 20 , it is apparent that gold and silver will take their place and become the principal circulating medium in the common business of the farmers and mechanics of the country . The attainment of such a result will form an era in the history of our country which will be dwelt upon with delight by every true friend of its liberty and independence . It will lighten the great tax which our paper system has so long collected from the earnings of labor , and do more to revive and perpetuate those habits of economy and simplicity which are so congenial to the character of republicans than all the legislation which has yet been attempted . To this subject I feel that I can not too earnestly invite the special attention of Congress , without the exercise of whose authority the opportunity to accomplish so much public good must pass unimproved . Deeply impressed with its vital importance , the Executive has taken all the steps within his constitutional power to guard the public revenue and defeat the expectation which the Bank of the United States indulged of renewing and perpetuating its monopoly on the ground of its necessity as a fiscal agent and as affording a sounder currency than could be obtained without such an institution . In the performance of this duty much responsibility was incurred which would have been gladly avoided if the stake which the public had in the question could have been otherwise preserved . Although clothed with the legal authority and supported by precedent , I was aware that there was in the act of the removal of the deposits a liability to excite that sensitiveness to Executive power which it is characteristic and the duty of free men to indulge but I relied on this feeling also , directed by patriotism and intelligence , to vindicate the conduct which in the end would appear to have been called for by the interests of my country . The apprehensions natural to this feeling that there may have been a desire , through the instrumentality of that measure , to extend the Executive influence , or that it may have been prompted by motives not sufficiently free from ambition , were not over looked . Under the operation of our institutions the public servant who is called on to take a step of high responsibility should feel in the freedom which gives rise to such apprehensions his highest security . When unfounded the attention which they arouse and the discussions they excite deprive those who indulge them of the power to do harm when just they but hasten the certainty with which the great body of our citizens never fail to repel an attempt to procure the sanction to any exercise of power inconsistent with the jealous maintenance of their rights . Under such convictions , and entertaining no doubt that my constitutional obligations demanded the steps which were taken inreference to the removal of the deposits , it was impossible for me to be deterred from the path of duty by a fear that my motives could be misjudged or that political prejudices could defeat the just consideration of the merits of my conduct . The result has shewn how safe is this reliance upon the patriotic temper and enlightened discernment of the people . That measure has now been before them and has stood the test of all the severe analysis which its general importance , the interests it affected , and the apprehensions it excited were calculated to produce , and it now remains for Congress to consider what legislation has become necessary in consequence . I need only add to what I have on former occasions said on this subject general ly that in the regulations which Congress may prescribe respecting the custody of the public moneys it is desirable that as little discretion as may be deemed consistent with their safe keeping should be given to the executive agents . No one can be more deeply impressed than I am with the soundness of the doctrine which restrains and limits , by specific provisions , executive discretion , as far as it can be done consistently with the preservation of its constitutional character . In respect to the control over the public money this doctrine is peculiarly applicable , and is in harmony with the great principle which I felt I was sustaining in the controversy with the Bank of the United States , which has resulted in severing to some extent a dangerous connection between a moneyed and political power . The duty of the Legislature to define , by clear and positive enactments , the nature and extent of the action which it belongs to the Executive to superintend springs out of a policy analogous to that which enjoins upon all branches of the Federal Government an abstinence from the exercise of powers not clearly granted . In such a Government , possessing only limited and specific powers , the spirit of its general administration can not be wise or just when it opposes the reference of all doubtful points to the great source of authority , the States and the people , whose number and diversified relations securing them against the influences and excitements which may mis lead their agents , make them the safest depository of power . In its application to the Executive , with reference to the legislative branch of the Government , the same rule of action should make the President ever anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary authority which can be regulated by Congress . The biases which may operate upon him will not be so likely to extend to the representatives of the people in that body . In my former messages to Congress I have repeatedly urged the propriety of lessening the discretionary authority lodged in the various Departments , but it has produced no effect as yet , except the discontinuance of extra allowances in the Army and Navy and the substitution of fixed salaries in the latter . It is believed that the same principles could be advantageously applied in all cases , and would promote the efficiency and economy of the public service , at the same tiem that greater satisfaction and more equal justice would be secured to the public officers generally . The accompanying report of the Secretary of War will put you in possession of the operations of the Department confided to his care in all its diversified relations during the past year . I am gratified in being able to inform you that no occurrence has required any movement of the military force , except such as is common to a state of peace . The services of the Army have been limited to their usual duties at the various garrisons upon the Atlantic and in land frontier , with the exceptions states by the Secretary of War . Our small military establishment appears to be adequate to the purposes for which it is maintained , and it forms a nucleus around which any additional force may be collected should the public exigencies unfortunately require any increase of our military means .<speech_sep>Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives Addressing to you the last annual message I shall ever present to the Congress of the United States , it is a source of the most heartfelt satisfaction to be able to congratulate you on the high state of prosperity which our beloved country has attained . With no causes at home or abroad to lessen the confidence with which we look to the future for continuing proofs of the capacity of our free institutions to produce all the fruits of good government , the general condition of our affairs may well excite our national pride . I can not avoid congratulating you , and my country particularly , on the success of the efforts made during my administration by the executive and legislature , in conformity with the sincere , constant , and earnest desire of the people , to maintain peace and establish cordial relations with all foreign powers . Our gratitude is due to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe , and I invite you to unite with me in offering to Him fervent supplications that His providential care may ever be extended to those who follow us , enabling them to avoid the dangers and the horrors of war consistently with a just and indispensable regard to the rights and honor of our country . But although the present state of our foreign affairs , standing , without important change , as they did when you separated in July last , is flattering in the extreme , I regret to say that many questions of an interesting character , at issue with other powers , are yet unadjusted . Amongst the most prominent of these is that of our Northeast boundary . With an undiminished confidence in the sincere desire of His Britannic Majesty s government to adjust that question , I am not yet in possession of the precise grounds upon which it proposes a satisfactory adjustment . With France our diplomatic relations have been resumed , and under circumstances which attest the disposition of both governments to preserve a mutually beneficial intercourse and foster those amicable feelings which are so strongly required by the true interests of the two countries . With Russia , Austria , Prussia , Naples , Sweden , and Denmark the best understanding exists , and our commercial intercourse is gradually expanding itself with them . It is encouraged in all these countries , except Naples , by their mutually advantageous and liberal treaty stipulations with us . The claims of our citizens on Portugal are admitted to be just , but provision for the payment of them has been unfortunately delayed by frequent political changes in that Kingdom . The blessings of peace have not been secured by Spain . Our connections with that country are on the best footing , with the exception of the burdens still imposed upon our commerce with her possessions out of Europe . The claims of American citizens for losses sustained at the bombardment of Antwerp have been presented to the governments of Holland and Belgium , and will be pressed , in due season , to settlement . With Brazil and all our neighbors of this continent we continue to maintain relations of amity and concord , extending our commerce with them as far as the resources of the people and the policy of their governments will permit . The just and long standing claims of our citizens upon some of them are yet sources of dissatisfaction and complaint . No danger is apprehended , however , that they will not be peacefully , although tardily , acknowledged and paid by all , unless the irritating effect of her struggle with Texas should unfortunately make our immediate neighbor , Mexico , an exception . It is already known to you , by the correspondence between the two governments communicated at your last session , that our conduct in relation to that struggle is regulated by the same principles that governed us in the dispute between Spain and Mexico herself , and I trust that it will be found on the most severe scrutiny that our acts have strictly corresponded with our professions . That the inhabitants of the United States should feel strong prepossessions for the one party is not surprising . But this circumstance should of itself teach us great caution , lest it lead us into the great error of suffering public policy to be regulated by partially or prejudice and there are considerations connected with the possible result of this contest between the two parties of so much delicacy and importance to the United States that our character requires that we should neither anticipate events nor attempt to control them . The known desire of the Texans to become a part of our system , although its gratification depends upon the reconcilement of various and conflicting interests , necessarily a work of time and uncertain in itself , is calculated to expose our conduct to misconstruction in the eyes of the world . There are already those who , indifferent to principle themselves and prone to suspect the want of it in others , charge us with ambitious designs and insidious policy . You will perceive by the accompanying documents that the extraordinary mission from Mexico has been terminated on the sole ground that the obligations of this government to itself and to Mexico , under treaty stipulations , have compelled me to trust a discretionary authority to a high officer of our Army to advance into territory claimed as part of Texas if necessary to protect our own or the neighboring frontier from Indian depredation . In the opinion of the Mexican functionary who has just left us , the honor of his country will be wounded by American soldiers entering , with the most amicable avowed purposes , upon ground from which the followers of his government have been expelled , and over which there is at present no certainty of a serious effort on its part to re establish its dominion . The departure of this minister was the more singular as he was apprised that the sufficiency of the causes assigned for the advance of our troops by the commanding general had been seriously doubted by me , and there was every reason to suppose that the troops of the United States , their commander having had time to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the information upon which they had been marched to Nacogdoches , would be either there in perfect accordance with the principles admitted to be just in his conference with the Secretary of State by the Mexican minister himself , or were already withdrawn in consequence of the impressive warnings their commanding officer had received from the Department of War . It is hoped and believed that his government will take a more dispassionate and just view of this subject , and not be disposed to construe a measure of justifiable precaution , made necessary by its known inability in execution of the stipulations of our treaty to act upon the frontier , into an encroachment upon its rights or a stain upon its honor . In the mean time the ancient complaints of injustice made on behalf of our citizens are disregarded , and new causes of dissatisfaction have arisen , some of them of a character requiring prompt remonstrance and ample and immediate redress . I trust , however , by tempering firmness with courtesy and acting with great forbearance upon every incident that has occurred or that may happen , to do and to obtain justice , and thus avoid the necessity of again bringing this subject to the view of Congress . It is my duty to remind you that no provision has been made to execute our treaty with Mexico for tracing the boundary line between the two countries . What ever may be the prospect of Mexico s being soon able to execute the treaty on its part , it is proper that we should be in anticipation prepared at all times to perform our obligations , without regard to the probable condition of those with whom we have contracted them . The result of the confidential inquiries made into the condition and prospects of the newly declared Texan government will be communicated to you in the course of the session . Commercial treaties promising great advantages to our enterprising merchants and navigators have been formed with the distant governments of Muscat and Siam . The ratifications have been exchanged , but have not reached the Department of State . Copes of the treaties will be transmitted to you if received before , or published if arriving after , the close of the present session of Congress . Nothing has occurred to interrupt the good understanding that has long existed with the Barbary powers , nor to check the good will which is gradually growing up from our intercourse with the dominions of the government of growing of the distinguished chief of the Ottoman Empire . Information has been received at the Department of State that a treaty with the Emperor of Morocco has just been negotiated , which , I hope , will be received in time to be laid before the Senate previous to the close of the session . You will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that the financial means of the country continue to keep pace with its improvement in all other respects . The receipts into the Treasury during the present year will amount to about 47 , 691 , 898 those from customs being estimated at 22 , 523 , 151 , those from lands at about 24 , 000 , 000 , and the residue from miscellaneous sources . The expenditures for all objects during the year are estimated not to exceed 32 , 000 , 000 , which will leave a balance in the Treasury for public purposes on the first day of January next of about 41 , 723 , 959 . This sum , with the exception of 5 , 000 , 000 , will be transferred to the several states in accordance with the provisions of the act regulating the deposits of the public money . The unexpended balances of appropriation on the first day of January next are estimated at 14 , 636 , 062 , exceeding by 9 , 636 , 062 the amount which will be left in the deposit banks , subject to the draft of the Treasurer of the United States , after the contemplated transfers to the several states are made . If , therefore , the future receipts should not be sufficient to meet these outstanding and future appropriations , there may be soon a necessity to use a portion of the funds deposited with the states . The consequences apprehended when the deposit act of the last session received a reluctant approval have been measurably realized . Though an act merely for the deposit of the surplus moneys of the United States in the state treasuries for safe keeping until they may be wanted for the service of the general government , it has been extensively spoken of as an act to give the money to the several states , and they have been advised to use it as a gift , without regard to the means of refunding it when called for . Such a suggestion has doubtless been made without a proper attention to the various principles and interests which are affected by it . It is manifest that the law itself can not sanction such a suggestion , and that as it now stands the States have no more authority to receive and use these deposits without intending to return them than any deposit bank or any individual temporarily charged with the safe keeping or application of the public money would now have for converting the same to their private use without the consent and against the will of the government . But independently of the violation of public faith and moral obligation which are involved in this suggestion when examined in reference to the terms of the present deposit act , it is believed that the considerations which should govern the future legislation of Congress on this subject will be equally conclusive against the adoption of any measure recognizing the principles on which the suggestion has been made . Considering the intimate connection of the subject with the financial interests of the country and its great importance in whatever aspect it can be viewed , I have bestowed upon it the most anxious reflection , and feel it to be my duty to state to Congress such thoughts as have occurred to me , to aid their deliberation in treating it in the manner best calculated to conduce to the common good . The experience of other nations admonished us to hasten the extinguishment of the public debt but it will be in vain that we have congratulated each other upon the disappearance of this evil if we do not guard against the equally great one of promoting the unnecessary accumulation of public revenue . No political maxim is better established than that which tells us that an improvident expenditure of money is the parent of profligacy , and that no people can hope to perpetuate their liberties who long acquiesce in a policy which taxes them for objects not necessary to the legitimate and real wants of their government . Flattering as is the condition of our country at the present period , because of its unexampled advance in all the steps of social and political improvement , it can not be disguised that there is a lurking danger already apparent in the neglect of this warning truth , and that the time has arrived when the representatives of the people should be employed in devising some more appropriate remedy than now exists to avert it . Under our present revenue system there is every probability that there will continue to be a surplus beyond the wants of the government , and it has become our duty to decide whether such a result be consistent with the true objects of our government . Should a surplus be permitted to accumulate beyond the appropriations , it must be retained in the Treasury , as it now is , or distributed among the people or the states . To retain it in the Treasury unemployed in any way is impracticable it is , besides , against the genius of our free institutions to lock up in vaults the treasure of the nation . To take from the people the right of bearing arms and put their weapons of defense in the hands of a standing army would be scarcely more dangerous to their liberties than to permit the government to accumulate immense amounts of treasure beyond the supplies necessary to its legitimate wants . Such a treasure would doubtless be employed at some time , as it has been in other countries , when opportunity tempted ambition . To collect it merely for distribution to the states would seem to be highly impolitic , if not as dangerous as the proposition to retain it in the Treasury . The shortest reflection must satisfy everyone that to require the people to pay taxes to the government merely that they may be paid back again is sporting with the substantial interests of the country , and no system which produces such a result can be expected to receive the public countenance . Nothing could be gained by it even if each individual who contributed a portion of the tax could receive back promptly the same portion . But it is apparent that no system of the kind can ever be enforced which will not absorb a considerable portion of the money to be distributed in salaries and commissions to the agents employed in the process and in the various losses and depreciations which arise from other causes , and the practical effect of such an attempt must ever be to burden the people with taxes , not for purposes beneficial to them , but to swell the profits of deposit banks and support a band of useless public officers . A distribution to the people is impracticable and unjust in other respects . It would be taking one man s property and giving it to another . Such would be the unavoidable result of a rule of equality and none other is spoken of or would be likely to be adopted , in as much as there is no mode by which the amount of the individual contributions of our citizens to the public revenue can be ascertained . We know that they contribute unequally , and a rule , therefore , that would distribute to them equally would be liable to all the objections which apply to the principle of an equal division of property . To make the general government the instrument of carrying this odious principle into effect would be at once to destroy the means of its usefulness and change the character designed for it by the framers of the Constitution . But the more extended and injurious consequences likely to result from a policy which would collect a surplus revenue from the purpose of distributing it may be forcibly illustrated by an examination of the effects already produced by the present deposit act . This act , although certainly designed to secure the safe keeping of the public revenue , is not entirely free in its tendencies from any of the objections which apply to this principle of distribution . The government had without necessity received from the people a large surplus , which , instead of being employed as heretofore and returned to them by means of the public expenditure , was deposited with sundry banks . The banks proceeded to make loans upon this surplus , and thus converted it into banking capital , and in this manner it has tended to multiply bank charters and has had a great agency in producing a spirit of wild speculation . The possession and use of the property out of which this surplus was created belonged to the people , but the government has transferred its possession to incorporated banks , whose interest and effort it is to make large profits out of its use . This process need only be stated to show its injustice and bad policy . And the same observations apply to the influence which is produced by the steps necessary to collect as well as to distribute such a revenue . About three fifths of all the duties on imports are paid in the city of New York , but it is obvious that the means to pay those duties are drawn from every quarter of the Union . Every citizen in every state who purchases and consumes an article which has paid a duty at that port contributes to the accumulating mass . The surplus collected there must therefore be made up of moneys or property withdrawn from other points and other states . Thus the wealth and business of every region from which these surplus funds proceed must be to some extent injured , while that of the place where the funds are concentrated and are employed in banking are proportionably extended . But both in making the transfer of the funds which are first necessary to pay the duties and collect the surplus and in making the re transfer which becomes necessary when the time arrives for the distribution of that surplus there is a considerable period when the funds can not be brought into use , and it is manifest that , besides the loss inevitable from such an operation , its tendency is to produce fluctuations in the business of the country , which are always productive of speculation and detrimental to the interests of regular trade . Argument can scarcely be necessary to show that a measure of this character ought not to receive further legislative encouragement . By examining the practical operation of the ration for distribution adopted in the deposit bill of the last session we shall discover other features that appear equally objectionable . Let it be assumed , for the sake of argument , that the surplus moneys to be deposited with the states have been collected and belong to them in the ration of their federal representative population an assumption founded upon the fact that any deficiencies in our future revenue from imposts and public lands must be made up by direct taxes collected from the states in that ration . It is proposed to distribute this surplus say 30 , 000 , 000 not according to the ration in which it has been collected and belongs to the people of the states , but in that of their votes in the colleges of electors of President and Vice President . The effect of a distribution upon that ration is shown by the annexed table , marked By an examination of that table it will be perceived that in the distribution of a surplus of 30 , 000 , 000 upon that basis there is a great departure from the principle which regards representation as the true measure of taxation , and it will be found that the tendency of that departure will be to increase whatever inequalities have been supposed to attend the operation of our federal system in respect to its bearings upon the different interests of the union . In making the basis of representation the basis of taxation the framers of the Constitution intended to equalize the burdens which are necessary to support the government , and the adoption of that ratio , while it accomplished this object , was also the means of adjusting other great topics arising out of the conflicting views respecting the political equality of the various members of the Confederacy . What ever , therefore , disturbs the liberal spirit of the compromises which established a rule of taxation so just and equitable , and which experience has proved to be so well adapted to the genius and habits of our people , should be received with the greatest caution and distrust . A bare inspection in the annexed table of the differences produced by the ration used in the deposit act compared with the results of a distribution according to the ration of direct taxation must satisfy every unprejudiced mind that the former ration contravenes the spirit of the Constitution and produces a degree of injustice in the operations of the federal government which would be fatal to the hope of perpetuating it . By the ration of direct taxation , for example , the state of Delaware in the collection of 30 , 000 , 000 of revenue would pay into the Treasury 188 , 716 , and in a distribution of 30 , 000 , 000 she would receive back from the government , according to the ration of the deposit bill , the sum of 306 , 122 and similar results would follow the comparison between the small and the large states throughout the union , thus realizing to the small states an advantage which would be doubtless as unacceptable to them as a motive for incorporating the principle in any system which would produce it as it would be inconsistent with the rights and expectations of the large states . It was certainly the intention of that provision of the Constitution which declares that all duties , imposts , and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States to make the burdens of taxation fall equally upon the people in whatever state of the union they may reside . But what would be the value of such a uniform rule if the moneys raised by it could be immediately returned by a different one which will give to the people of some states much more and to those of others much less than their fair proportions Were the federal government to exempt in express terms the imports , products , and manufactures of some portions of the country from all duties while it imposed heavy ones on others , the injustice could not be greater . It would be easy to show how by the operation of such a principle the large states of the union would not only have to contribute their just share toward the support of the federal government , but also have to bear in some degree the taxes necessary to support the governments of their smaller sisters but it is deemed unnecessary to state the details where the general principle is so obvious . A system liable to such objections can never be supposed to have been sanctioned by the framers of the Constitution when they conferred on Congress the taxing power , and I feel persuaded that a mature examination of the subject will satisfy everyone that there are insurmountable difficulties in the operation of any plan which can be devised of collecting revenue for the purpose of distributing it . Congress is only authorized to levy taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States . There is no such provision as would authorize Congress to collect together the property of the country , under the name of revenue , for the purpose of dividing it equally or unequally among the states or the people . Indeed , it is not probable that such an idea ever occurred to the states when they adopted the Constitution . But however this may be , the only safe rule for us in interpreting the powers granted to the federal government is to regard the absence of express authority to touch a subject so important and delicate as this as equivalent to a prohibition . Even if our powers were less doubtful in this respect as the Constitution now stands , there are considerations afforded by recent experience which would seem to make it our duty to avoid a resort to such a system . All will admit that the simplicity and economy of the state governments mainly depend on the fact that money has to be supplied to support them by the same men , or their agents , who vote it away in appropriations . Hence when there are extravagant and wasteful appropriations there must be a corresponding increase of taxes , and the people , becoming awakened , will necessarily scrutinize the character of measures which thus increase their burdens . By the watchful eye of self interest the agents of the people in the state governments are repressed and kept within the limits of a just economy . But if the necessity of levying the taxes be taken from those who make the appropriations and thrown upon a more distant and less responsible set of public agents , who have power to approach the people by an indirect and stealthy taxation , there is reason to fear that prodigality will soon supersede those characteristics which have thus far made us look with so much pride and confidence to the state governments as the mainstay of our union and liberties . The state legislatures , instead of studying to restrict their state expenditures to the smallest possible sum , will claim credit for their profusion , and harass the general government for increased supplies . Practically there would soon be but one taxing power , and that vested in a body of men far removed from the people , in which the farming and mechanic interests would scarcely be represented . The states would gradually lose their purity as well as their independence they would not dare to murmur at the proceedings of the general government , lest they should lose their supplies all would be merged in a practical consolidation , cemented by widespread corruption , which could only be eradicated by one of those bloody revolutions which occasionally overthrow the despotic systems of the Old World . In all the other aspects in which I have been able to look at the effect of such a principle of distribution upon the best interests of the country I can see nothing to compensate for the disadvantages to which I have adverted . If we consider the protective duties , which are in a great degree the source of the surplus revenue , beneficial to one section of the union and prejudicial to another , there is no corrective for the evil in such a plan of distribution . On the contrary , there is reason to fear that all the complaints which have sprung from this cause would be aggravated . Everyone must be sensible that a distribution of the surplus must beget a disposition to cherish the means which create it , and any system , therefore , into which it enters must have a powerful tendency to increase rather than diminish the tariff . If it were even admitted that the advantages of such a system could be made equal to all the sections of the Union , the reasons already so urgently calling for a reduction of the revenue would never the less lose none of their force , for it will always be improbable that an intelligent and virtuous community can consent to raise a surplus for the mere purpose of dividing it , diminished as it must inevitably be by the expenses of the various machinery necessary to the process . The safest and simplest mode of obviating all the difficulties which have been mentioned is to collect only revenue enough to meet the wants of the government , and let the people keep the balance of their property in their own hands , to be used for their own profit . Each state will then support its own government and contribute its due share toward the support of the general government . There would be no surplus to cramp and lessen the resources of individual wealth and enterprise , and the banks would be left to their ordinary means . Whatever agitations and fluctuations might arise from our unfortunate paper system , they could never be attributed , justly or unjustly , to the action of the federal government . There would be some guaranty that the spirit of wild speculation which seeks to convert the surplus revenue into banking capital would be effectually checked , and that the scenes of demoralization which are now so prevalent through the land would disappear . Without desiring to conceal that the experience and observation of the last two years have operated a partial change in my views upon this interesting subject , it is never the less regretted that the suggestions made by me in my annual messages of 1829 and 1830 have been greatly misunderstood . At that time the great struggle was begun against that latitudinarian construction of the Constitution which authorizes the unlimited appropriation of the revenues of the union to internal improvements within the states , tending to invest in the hands and place under the control of the general government all the principal roads and canals of the country , in violation of state rights and in derogation of state authority . At the same time the condition of the manufacturing interest was such as to create an apprehension that the duties on imports could not without extensive mischief be reduced in season to prevent the accumulation of a considerable surplus after the payment of the national debt . In view of the dangers of such a surplus , and in preference to its application to internal improvements in derogation of the rights and powers of the states , the suggestion of an amendment of the Constitution to authorize its distribution was made . It was an alternative for what were deemed greater evils a temporary resort to relieve an over burdened treasury until the government could , without a sudden and destructive revulsion in the business of the country , gradually return to the just principle of raising no more revenue from the people in taxes than is necessary for its economical support . Even that alternative was not spoken of but in connection with an amendment of the Constitution . No temporary inconvenience can justify the exercise of a prohibited power not granted by that instrument , and it was from a conviction that the power to distribute even a temporary surplus of revenue is of that character that it was suggested only in connection with an appeal to the source of all legal power in the general government , the states which have established it . No such appeal has been taken , and in my opinion a distribution of the surplus revenue by Congress either to the states or the people is to be considered as among the prohibitions of the Constitution . As already intimated , my views have undergone a change so far as to be convinced that no alteration of the Constitution in this respect is wise or expedient . The influence of an accumulating surplus upon the credit system of the country , producing dangerous extensions and ruinous contractions , fluctuations in the price of property , rash speculation , idleness , extravagance , and a deterioration of morals , have taught us the important lesson that any transient mischief which may attend the reduction of our revenue to the wants of our government is to be borne in preference to an overflowing treasury . I beg leave to call your attention to another subject intimately associated with the preceding one the currency of the country . It is apparent from the whole context of the Constitution , as well as the history of the times which gave birth to it , that it was the purpose of the Convention to establish a currency consisting of the precious metals . These , from their peculiar properties which rendered them the standard of value in all other countries , were adopted in this as well to establish its commercial standard in reference to foreign countries by a permanent rule as to exclude the use of a mutable medium of exchange , such as of certain agricultural commodities recognized by the statutes of some states as a tender for debts , or the still more pernicious expedient of a paper currency . The last , from the experience of the evils of the issues of paper during the Revolution , had become so justly obnoxious as not only to suggest the clause in the Constitution forbidding the emission of bills of credit by the states , but also to produce that vote in the Convention which negatived the proposition to grant power to Congress to charter corporations a proposition well understood at the time as intended to authorize the establishment of a national bank , which was to issue a currency of bank notes on a capital to be created to some extent out of government stocks . Although this proposition was refused by a direct vote of the Convention , the object was afterwards in effect obtained by its ingenious advocates through a strained construction of the Constitution . The debts of the Revolution were funded at prices which formed no equivalent compared with the nominal amount of the stock , and under circumstances which exposed the motives of some of those who participated in the passage of the act to distrust . The facts that the value of the stock was greatly enhanced by the creation of the bank , that it was well understood that such would be the case , and that some of the advocates of the measure were largely benefited by it belong to the history of the times , and are well calculated to diminish the respect which might otherwise have been due to the action of the Congress which created the institution . On the establishment of a national bank it became the interest of its creditors that gold should be superseded by the paper of the bank as a general currency . A value was soon attached to the gold coins which made their exportation to foreign countries as a mercantile commodity more profitable than their retention and use at home as money . It followed as a matter of course , if not designed by those who established the bank , that the bank became in effect a substitute for the Mint of the United States . Such was the origin of a national bank currency , and such the beginning of those difficulties which now appear in the excessive issues of the banks incorporated by the various States . Although it may not be possible by any legislative means within our power to change at once the system which has thus been introduced , and has received the acquiescence of all portions of the country , it is certainly our duty to do all that is consistent with our constitutional obligations in preventing the mischiefs which are threatened by its undue extension . That the efforts of the fathers of our government to guard against it by a constitutional provision were founded on an intimate knowledge of the subject has been frequently attested by the bitter experience of the country . The same causes which led them to refuse their sanction to a power authorizing the establishment of incorporations for banking purposes now exist in a much stronger degree to urge us to exert the utmost vigilance in calling into action the means necessary to correct the evils resulting from the unfortunate exercise of the power , and it is hoped that the opportunity for effecting this great good will be improved before the country witnesses new scenes of embarrassment and distress . Variableness must ever be the characteristic of a currency of which the precious metals are not the chief ingredient , or which can be expanded or contracted without regard to the principles that regulate the value of those metals as a standard in the general trade of the world . With us bank issues constitute such a currency , and must ever do so until they are made dependent on those just proportions of gold and silver as a circulating medium which experience has proved to be necessary not only in this but in all other commercial countries . Where those proportions are not infused into the circulation and do not control it , it is manifest that prices must vary according to the tide of bank issues , and the value and stability of property must stand exposed to all the uncertainty which attends the administration of institutions that are constantly liable to the temptation of an interest distinct from that of the community in which they are established . The progress of an expansion , or rather a depreciation , of the currency by excessive bank issues is always attended by a loss to the laboring classes . This portion of the community have neither time nor opportunity to watch the ebbs and flows of the money market . Engaged from day to day in their useful toils , they do not perceive that although their wages are nominally the same , or even somewhat higher , they are greatly reduced in fact by the rapid increase of a spurious currency , which , as it appears to make money abound , they are at first inclined to consider a blessing . It is not so with the speculator , by whom this operation is better understood , and is made to contribute to his advantage . It is not until the prices of the necessaries of life become so dear that the laboring classes can not supply their wants out of their wages that the wages rise and gradually reach a justly proportioned rate to that of the products of their labor . When thus , by depreciation in consequence of the quantity of paper in circulation , wages as well as prices become exorbitant , it is soon found that the whole effect of the adulteration is a tariff on our home industry for the benefit of the countries where gold and silver circulate and maintain uniformity and moderation in prices . It is then perceived that the enhancement of the price of land and labor produces a corresponding increase in the price of products until these products do not sustain a competition with similar ones in other countries , and thus both manufactured and agricultural productions cease to bear expectation from the country of the spurious currency , because they can not be sold for cost . This is the process by which specie is banished by the paper of the banks . Their vaults are soon exhausted to pay for foreign commodities . The next step is a stoppage of specie payment a total degradation of paper as a currency unusual depression of prices , the ruin of debtors , and the accumulation of property in the hands of creditors and cautious capitalists . It was in view of these evils , together with the dangerous power wielded by the Bank of the United States and its repugnance to our Constitution , that I was induced to exert the power conferred upon me by the American people to prevent the continuance of that institution . But although various dangers to our republican institutions have been obviated by the failure of that bank to extort from the government a renewal of its charter , it is obvious that little has been accomplished except a salutary change of public opinion toward restoring to the country the sound currency provided for in the Constitution . In the acts of several of the states prohibiting the circulation of small notes and the auxiliary enactments of Congress at the last session forbidding their reception or payment on public account , the true policy of the country has been advanced and a larger portion of the precious metals infused into our circulating medium . These measures will probably be followed up in due time by the enactment of state laws banishing from circulation bank notes of still higher denominations , and the object may be materially promoted by further acts of Congress forbidding the employment as fiscal agents of such banks as continue to issue notes of low denominations and throw impediments in the way of the circulation of gold and silver . The effects of an extension of bank credits and over issues of bank paper have been strikingly illustrated in the sales of the public lands . From the returns made by the various registers and receivers in the early part of last summer it was perceived that the receipts arising from the sales of the public lands were increasing to an unprecedented amount . In effect , however , these receipts amounted to nothing more than credits in bank . The banks lent out their notes to speculators . They were paid to the receivers and immediately returned to the banks , to be lent out again and again , being mere instruments to transfer to speculators the most valuable public land and pay the government by a credit on the books of the banks . Those credits on the books of some of the Western banks , usually called deposits , were already greatly beyond their immediate means of payment , and were rapidly increasing . Indeed , each speculation furnished means for another for no sooner had one individual or company paid in the notes than they were immediately lent to another for a like purpose , and the banks were extending their business and their issues so largely as to alarm considerate men and render it doubtful whether these bank credits , if permitted to accumulate , would ultimately be of the least value to the government . The spirit of expansion and speculation was not confined to the deposit banks , but pervaded the whole multitude of banks throughout the union and was giving rise to new institutions to aggravate the evil . The safety of the public funds and the interest of the people generally required that these operations should be checked and it became the duty of every branch of the general and state governments to adopt all legitimate and proper means to produce that salutary effect . Under this view of my duty I directed the issuing of the order which will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury , requiring payment for the public lands sold to be made in specie , with an exception until the 15th of the present month in favor of actual settlers . This measure has produced many salutary consequences . It checked the career of the Western banks and gave them additional strength in anticipation of the pressure which has since pervaded our Eastern as well as the European commercial cities . By preventing the extension of the credit system it measurably cut off the means of speculation and retarded its progress in monopolizing the most valuable of the public lands . It has tended to save the new states from a non resident proprietorship , one of the greatest obstacles to the advancement of a new country and the prosperity of an old one . It has tended to keep open the public lands for entry by emigrants at government prices instead of their being compelled to purchase of speculators at double or triple prices . And it is conveying into the interior large sums in silver and gold , there to enter permanently into the currency of the country and place it on a firmer foundation . It is confidently believed that the country will find in the motives which induced that order and the happy consequences which will have ensued much to commend and nothing to condemn . It remains for Congress if they approve the policy which dictated this order to follow it up in its various bearings . Much good , in my judgment , would be produced by prohibiting sales of the public lands except to actual settlers at a reasonable reduction of price , and to limit the quantity which shall be sold to them . Although it is believed the general government never ought to receive anything but the constitutional currency in exchange for the public lands , that point would be of less importance if the lands were sold for immediate settlement and cultivation . Indeed , there is scarcely a mischief arising out of our present land system , including the accumulating surplus of revenues , which would not be remedied at once by a restriction on land sales to actual settlers and it promises other advantages to the country in general and to the new states in particular which can not fail to receive the most profound consideration of Congress . Experience continues to realize the expectations entertained as to the capacity of the state banks to perform the duties of fiscal agents for the government at the time of the removal of the deposits . It was alleged by the advocates of the Bank of the United States that the state banks , what ever might be the regulations of the Treasury Department , could not make the transfers required by the government or negotiate the domestic exchanges of the country . It is now well ascertained that the real domestic exchanges performed through discounts by the United States Bank and its 25 branches were at least one third less than those of the deposit banks for an equal period of time and if a comparison be instituted between the amounts of service rendered by these institutions on the broader basis which has been used by the advocates of the United States Bank in estimating what they consider the domestic exchanges transacted by it , the result will be still more favorable to the deposit banks . The whole amount of public money transferred by the Bank of the United States in 1832 was 16 , 000 , 000 . The amount transferred and actually paid by the deposit banks in the year ending the 1st of October last was 39 , 319 , 899 the amount transferred and paid between that period and the 6th of November was 5 , 399 , 000 , and the amount of transfer warrants outstanding on that day was 14 , 450 , 000 , making an aggregate of 59 , 168 , 894 . These enormous sums of money first mentioned have been transferred with the greatest promptitude and regularity , and the rates at which the exchanges have been negotiated previously to the passage of the deposit act were generally below those charged by the Bank of the United States . Independently of these services , which are far greater than those rendered by the United States Bank and its 25 branches , a number of the deposit banks have , with a commendable zeal to aid in the improvement of the currency , imported from abroad , at their own expense , large sums of the precious metals for coinage and circulation . In the same manner have nearly all the predictions turned out in respect to the effect of the removal of the deposits a step unquestionably necessary to prevent the evils which it was foreseen the bank itself would endeavor to create in a final struggle to procure a renewal of its charter . It may be thus , too , in some degree with the further steps which may be taken to prevent the excessive issue of other bank paper , but it is to be hoped that nothing will now deter the federal and state authorities from the firm and vigorous performance of their duties to themselves and to the people in this respect . In reducing the revenue to the wants of the government your particular attention is invited to those articles which constitute the necessaries of life . The duty on salt was laid as a war tax , and was no doubt continued to assist in providing for the payment of the war debt . There is no article the release of which from taxation would be felt so generally and so beneficially . To this may be added all kinds of fuel and provisions . Justice and benevolence unite in favor of releasing the poor of our cities from burdens which are not necessary to the support of our government and tend only to increase the wants of the destitute . It will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury and the accompanying documents that the Bank of the United States has made no payment on account of the stock held by the government in that institution , although urged to pay any portion which might suit its convenience , and that it has given no information when payment may be expected . Nor , although repeatedly requested , has it furnished the information in relation to its condition which Congress authorized the Secretary to collect at their last session . Such measures as are within the power of the executive have been taken to ascertain the value of the stock and procure the payment as early as possible . The conduct and present condition of that bank and the great amount of capital vested in it by the United States require your careful attention . Its charter expired on the third day of March last , and it has now no power but that given in the 21st section , to use the corporate name , style , and capacity for the purpose of suits for the final settlement and liquidation of the affairs and accounts of the corporation , and for the sale and disposition of their estate real , personal , and mixed but not for any other purpose or in any other manner what so ever , nor for a period exceeding two years after the expiration of the said term of incorporation . Before the expiration of the charter the stock holders of the bank obtained an act of incorporation from the legislature of Pennsylvania , excluding only the United States . Instead of proceeding to wind up their concerns and pay over to the United States the amount due on account of the stock held by them , the president and directors of the old bank appear to have transferred the books , papers , notes , obligations , and most or all of its property to this new corporation , which entered upon business as a continuation of the old concern . Amongst other acts of questionable validity , the notes of the expired corporation are known to have been used as its own and again put in circulation . That the old bank had no right to issue or re issue its notes after the expiration of its charter can not be denied , and that it could not confer any such right on its substitute any more than exercise it itself is equally plain . In law and honesty the notes of the bank in circulation at the expiration of its charter should have been called in by public advertisement , paid up as presented , and , together with those on hand , canceled and destroyed . Their re issue is sanctioned by no law and warranted by no necessity . If the United States be responsible in their stock for the payment of these notes , their re issue by the new corporation for their own profit is a fraud on the government . If the United States is not responsible , then there is no legal responsibility in any quarter , and it is a fraud on the country . They are the redeemed notes of a dissolved partnership , but , contrary to the wishes of the retiring partner and without his consent , are again re issued and circulated . It is the high and peculiar duty of Congress to decide whether any further legislation be necessary for the security of the large amount of public property now held and in use by the new bank , and for vindicating the rights of the government and compelling a speedy and honest settlement with all the creditors of the old bank , public and private , or whether the subject shall be left to the power now possessed by the executive and judiciary . It remains to be seen whether the persons who as managers of the old bank undertook to control the government , retained the public dividends , shut their doors upon a committee of the House of Representatives , and filled the country with panic to accomplish their own sinister objects may now as managers of a new bank continue with impunity to flood the country with a spurious currency , use the 7 million of government stock for their own profit , and refuse to the United States all information as to the present condition of their own property and the prospect of recovering it into their own possession . The lessons taught by the Bank of the United States can not well be lost upon the American people . They will take care never again to place so tremendous a power in irresponsible hands , and it will be fortunate if they seriously consider the consequences which are likely to result on a smaller scale from the facility with which corporate powers are granted by their state governments . It is believed that the law of the last session regulating the deposit banks operates onerously and unjustly upon them in many respects , and it is hoped that Congress , on proper representations , will adopt the modifications which are necessary to prevent this consequence . The report of the Secretary of War ad interim and the accompanying documents , all which are herewith laid before you , will give you a full view of the diversified and important operations of that department during the past year . The military movements rendered necessary by the aggressions of the hostile portions of the Seminole and Creek tribes of Indians , and by other circumstances , have required the active employment of nearly our whole regular force , including the Marine Corps , and of large bodies of militia and volunteers . With all these events so far as they were known at the seat of government before the termination of your last session you are already acquainted , and it is therefore only needful in this place to lay before you a brief summary of what has since occurred . The war with the Seminoles during the summer was on our part chiefly confined to the protection of our frontier settlements from the incursions of the enemy , and , as a necessary and important means for the accomplishment of that end , to the maintenance of the posts previously established . In the course of this duty several actions took place , in which the bravery and discipline of both officers and men were conspicuously displayed , and which I have deemed it proper to notice in respect to the former by the granting of brevet rank for gallant services in the field . But as the force of the Indians was not so far weakened by these partial successes as to lead them to submit , and as their savage inroads were frequently repeated , early measures were taken for placing at the disposal of Governor Call , who as commander in chief of the Territorial militia had been temporarily invested with the command , an ample force for the purpose of resuming offensive operations in the most efficient manner so soon as the season should permit . Major General Jesup was also directed , on the conclusion of his duties in the Creek country , to repair to Florida and assume the command . The result of the first movement made by the forces under the direction of Governor Call in October last , as detailed in the accompanying papers , excited much surprise and disappointment . A full explanation has been required of the causes which led to the failure of that movement , but has not yet been received . In the mean time , as it was feared that the health of Governor Call , who was understood to have suffered much from sickness , might not be adequate to the crisis , and as Major General Jesup was known to have reached Florida , that officer was directed to assume command , and to prosecute all needful operations with the utmost promptitude and vigor . From the force at his disposal and the dispositions he has made and is instructed to make , and from the very efficient measures which it is since ascertained have been taken by Governor Call , there is reason to hope that they will soon be enabled to reduce the enemy to subjection . In the mean time , as you will perceive from the report of the Secretary , there is urgent necessity for further appropriations to suppress these hostilities . Happily for the interests of humanity , the hostilities with the Creeks were brought to a close soon after your adjournment , without that effusion of blood which at one time was apprehended as inevitable . The unconditional submission of the hostile party was followed by their speedy removal to the country assigned them West of the Mississippi . The inquiry as to alleged frauds in the purchase of the reservations of these Indians and the causes of their hostilities , requested by the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 1st of July last 1836 07 01 to be made by the President , is now going on through the agency of commissioners appointed for that purpose . Their report may be expected during your present session . The difficulties apprehended in the Cherokee country have been prevented , and the peace and safety of that region and its vicinity effectually secured , by the timely measures taken by the War Department , and still continued . The discretionary authority given to General Gaines to cross the Sabine and to occupy a position as far West as Nacogdoches , in case he should deem such a step necessary to the protection of the frontier and to the fulfillment of the stipulations contained in our treaty with Mexico , and the movement subsequently made by that officer have been alluded to in a former part of this message . At the date of the latest intelligence from Nacogdoches our troops were yet at that station , but the officer who has succeeded General Gaines has recently been advised that from the facts known at the seat of government there would seem to be no adequate cause for any longer maintaining that position , and he was accordingly instructed , in case the troops were not already withdrawn under the discretionary powers before possessed by him , to give the requisite orders for that purpose on the receipt of the instructions , unless he shall then have in his possession such information as shall satisfy him that the maintenance of the post is essential to the protection of our frontiers and to the due execution of our treaty stipulations , as previously explained to him . Whilst the necessities existing during the present year for the service of militia and volunteers have furnished new proofs of the patriotism of our fellow citizens , they have also strongly illustrated the importance of an increase in the rank and file of the regular Army . The views of this subject submitted by the Secretary of War in his report meet my entire concurrence , and are earnestly commended to the deliberate attention of Congress . In this connection it is also proper to remind you that the defects in our present militia system are every day rendered more apparent . The duty of making further provision by law for organizing , arming , and disciplining this arm of defense has been so repeatedly presented to Congress by myself and my predecessors that I deem it sufficient on this occasion to refer to the last annual message and to former executive communications in which the subject has been discussed . It appears from the reports of the officers charged with mustering into service the volunteers called for under the act of Congress of the last session that more presented themselves at the place of rendezvous in Tennessee than were sufficient to meet the requisition which had been made by the Secretary of War upon the governor of that state . This was occasioned by the omission of the governor to apportion the requisition to the different regiments of militia so as to obtain the proper number of troops and no more . It seems but just to the patriotic citizens who repaired to the general rendezvous under circumstances authorizing them to believe that their services were needed and would be accepted that the expenses incurred by them while absent from their homes should be paid by the government . I accordingly recommend that a law to this effect be passed by Congress , giving them a compensation which will cover their expenses on the march to and from the place of rendezvous and while there in connection with which it will also be proper to make provision for such other equitable claims growing out of the service of the militia as may not be embraced in the existing laws . On the unexpected breaking out of hostilities in Florida , Alabama , and Georgia it became necessary in some cases to take the property of individuals for public use . Provision should be made by law for indemnifying the owners and I would also respectfully suggest whether some provision may not be made , consistently with the principles of our government , for the relief of the sufferers by Indian depredations or by the operations of our own troops . No time was lost after the making of the requisite appropriations in resuming the great national work of completing the unfinished fortifications on our sea board and of placing them in a proper state of defense . In consequence , however , of the very late day at which those bills were passed , but little progress could be made during the season which has just closed . A very large amount of the moneys granted at your last session accordingly remains unexpended but as the work will be again resumed at the earliest moment in the coming spring , the balance of the existing appropriations , and in several cases which will be laid before you , with the proper estimates , further sums for the like objects , may be usefully expended during the next year . The recommendations of an increase in the Engineer Corps and for a reorganization of the Topographical Corps , submitted to you in my last annual message , derive additional strength from the great embarrassments experienced during the present year in those branches of the service , and under which they are now suffering . Several of the most important surveys and constructions directed by recent laws have been suspended in consequence of the want of adequate force in these corps . The like observations may be applied to the Ordnance Corps and to the general staff , the operations of which as they are now organized must either be frequently interrupted or performed by officers taken from the line of the Army , to the great prejudice of the service . For a general view of the condition of the military academy and of other branches of the military service not already noticed , as well as for further illustrations of those which have been mentioned , I refer you to the accompanying documents , and among the various proposals contained therein for legislative action I would particularly notice the suggestion of the Secretary of War for the revision of the pay of the Army as entitled to your favorable regard . The national policy , founded alike in interest and in humanity , so long and so steadily pursued by this government for the removal of the Indian tribes originally settled on this side of the Mississippi to the West of that river , may be said to have been consummated by the conclusion of the late treaty with the Cherokees . The measures taken in the execution of that treaty and in relation to our Indian affairs generally will fully appear by referring to the accompanying papers . Without dwelling on the numerous and important topics embraced in them , I again invite your attention to the importance of providing a well digested and comprehensive system for the protection , supervision , and improvement of the various tribes now planted in the Indian country . The suggestions submitted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , and enforced by the Secretary , on this subject , and also in regard to the establishment of additional military posts in the Indian country , are entitled to your profound consideration . Both measures are necessary , for the double purpose of protecting the Indians from intestine war , and in other respects complying with our engagements with them , and of securing our western frontier against incursions which otherwise will assuredly be made on it . The best hopes of humanity in regard to the aboriginal race , the welfare of our rapidly extending settlements , and the honor of the United States are all deeply involved in the relations existing between this government and the emigrating tribes . I trust , therefore , that the various matters submitted in the accompanying documents in respect to those relations will receive your early and mature deliberation , and that it may issue in the adoption of legislative measures adapted to the circumstances and duties of the present crisis . You are referred to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a satisfactory view of the operations of the department under his charge during the present year . In the construction of vessels at the different navy yards and in the employment of our ships and squadrons at sea that branch of the service has been actively and usefully employed . While the situation of our commercial interests in the West Indies required a greater number than usual of armed vessels to be kept on that station , it is gratifying to perceive that the protection due to our commerce in other quarters of the world has not proved insufficient . Every effort has been made to facilitate the equipment of the exploring expedition authorized by the act of the last session , but all the preparation necessary to enable it to sail has not yet been completed . No means will be spared by the government to fit out the expedition on a scale corresponding with the liberal appropriations for the purpose and with the elevated character of the objects which are to be effected by it . I beg leave to renew the recommendation made in my last annual message respecting the enlistment of boys in our naval service , and to urge upon your attention the necessity of further appropriations to increase the number of ships afloat and to enlarge generally the capacity and force of the Navy . The increase of our commerce and our position in regard to the other powers of the world will always make it our policy and interest to cherish the great naval resources of our country . The report of the Postmaster General presents a gratifying picture of the condition of the Post Office Department . Its revenues for the year ending the 30th June last were 3 , 398 , 455 . 19 , showing an increase of revenue over that of the preceding year of 404 , 878 . 53 , or more than 13 percent . The expenditures for the same year were 2 , 755 , 623 . 76 , exhibiting a surplus of 642 , 831 . 43 . The department has been redeemed from embarrassment and debt , has accumulated a surplus exceeding half a million dollars , has largely extended and is preparing still further to extend the mail service , and recommends a reduction of postages equal to about 20 percent . It is practicing upon the great principle which should control every branch of our government of rendering to the public the greatest good possible with the least possible taxation to the people . The scale of postages suggested by the Postmaster General recommends itself , not only by the reduction it proposes , but by the simplicity of its arrangement , its conformity with the federal currency , and the improvement it will introduce into the accounts of the department and its agents . Your particular attention is invited to the subject of mail contracts with railroad companies . The present laws providing for the making of contracts are based upon the presumption that competition among bidders will secure the service at a fair price but on most of the railroad lines there is no competition in that kind of transportation , and advertising is therefore useless . No contract can now be made with them except such as shall be negotiated before the time of offering or afterwards , and the power of the Postmaster General to pay them high prices is practically without limitation . It would be a relief to him and no doubt would conduce to the public interest to prescribe by law some equitable basis upon which such contracts shall rest , and restrict him by a fixed rule of allowance . Under a liberal act of that sort he would undoubtedly be able to secure the services of most of the railroad companies , and the interest of the department would be thus advanced . The correspondence between the people of the United States and the European nations , and particularly with the British Islands , has become very extensive , and requires the interposition of Congress to give it security . No obstacle is perceived to an interchange of mails between New York and Liverpool or other foreign ports , as proposed by the Postmaster General . On the contrary , it promises , by the security it will afford , to facilitate commercial transactions and give rise to an enlarged intercourse among the people of different nations , which can not but have a happy effect . Through the city of New York most of the correspondence between the Canadas and Europe is now carried on , and urgent representations have been received from the head of the provincial post office asking the interposition of the United States to guard it from the accidents and losses to which it is now subjected . Some legislation appears to be called for as well by our own interest as by comity to the adjoining British provinces . The expediency of providing a fire proof building for the important books and papers of the Post Office Department is worthy of consideration . In the present condition of our Treasury it is neither necessary nor wise to leave essential public interests exposed to so much danger when they can so readily be made secure . There are weighty considerations in the location of a new building for that department in favor of placing it near the other executive buildings . The important subjects of a survey of the coast and the manufacture of a standard of weights and measures for the different custom houses have been in progress for some years under the general direction of the executive and the immediate superintendence of a gentleman possessing high scientific attainments . At the last session of Congress the making of a set of weights and measures for each state in the union was added to the others by a joint resolution . The care and correspondence as to all these subjects have been devolved on the Treasury Department during the last year . A special report from the Secretary of the Treasury will soon be communicated to Congress , which will show what has been accomplished as to the whole , the number and compensation of the persons now employed in these duties , and the progress expected to be made during the ensuing year , with a copy of the various correspondence deemed necessary to throw light on the subjects which seem to require additional legislation . Claims have been made for retrospective allowances in behalf of the superintendent and some of his assistants , which I did not feel justified in granting . Other claims have been made for large increases in compensation , which , under the circumstances of the several cases , I declined making without the express sanction of Congress . In order to obtain that sanction the subject was at the last session , on my suggestion and by request of the immediate superintendent , submitted by the Treasury Department to the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives . But no legislative action having taken place , the early attention of Congress is now invited to the enactment of some express and detailed provisions in relation to the various claims made for the past , and to the compensation and allowances deemed proper for the future . It is further respectfully recommended that , such being the inconvenience of attention to these duties by the Chief Magistrate , and such the great pressure of business on the Treasury Department , the general supervision of the coast survey and the completion of the weights and measures , if the works are kept united , should be devolved on a board of officers organized specially for that purpose , or on the Navy Board attached to the Navy Department . All my experience and reflection confirm the conviction I have so often expressed to Congress in favor of an amendment of the Constitution which will prevent in any event the election of the President and Vice President of the United States devolving on the House of Representatives and the Senate , and I therefore beg leave again to solicit your attention to the subject . There were various other suggestions in my last annual message not acted upon , particularly that relating to the want of uniformity in the laws of the District of Columbia , that are deemed worthy of your favorable consideration . Before concluding this paper I think it due to the various executive departments to bear testimony to their prosperous condition and to the ability and integrity with which they have been conducted . It has been my aim to enforce in all of them a vigilant and faithful discharge of the public business , and it is gratifying to me to believe that there is no just cause of complaint from any quarter at the manner in which they have fulfilled the objects of their creation . Having now finished the observations deemed proper on this the last occasion I shall have of communicating with the two Houses of Congress at their meeting , I can not omit an expression of the gratitude which is due to the great body of my fellow citizens , in whose partiality and indulgence I have found encouragement and support in the many difficult and trying scenes through which it has been my lot to pass during my public career . Though deeply sensible that my exertions have not been crowned with a success corresponding to the degree of favor bestowed upon me , I am sure that they will be considered as having been directed by an earnest desire to promote the good of my country , and I am consoled by the persuasion that what ever errors have been committed will find a corrective in the intelligence and patriotism of those who will succeed us . All that has occurred during my administration is calculated to inspire me with increased confidence in the stability of our institutions and should I be spared to enter upon that retirement which is so suitable to my age and infirm health and so much desired by me in other respects , I shall not cease to invoke that beneficent Being to whose providence we are already so signally indebted for the continuance of His blessings on our beloved country .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens About to undertake the arduous duties that I have been appointed to perform by the choice of a free people , I avail myself of this customary and solemn occasion to express the gratitude which their confidence inspires and to acknowledge the accountability which my situation enjoins . While the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred , it admonishes me that the best return I can make is the zealous dedication of my humble abilities to their service and their good . As the instrument of the Federal Constitution it will devolve on me for a stated period to execute the laws of the United States , to superintend their foreign and their confederate relations , to manage their revenue , to command their forces , and , by communications to the Legislature , to watch over and to promote their interests generally . And the principles of action by which I shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duties it is now proper for me briefly to explain . In administering the laws of Congress I shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the Executive power , trusting thereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its authority . With foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms , and in the adjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belonging to a gallant people . In such measures as I may be called on to pursue in regard to the rights of the separate States I hope to be animated by a proper respect for those sovereign members of our Union , taking care not to confound the powers they have reserved to themselves with those they have granted to the Confederacy . The management of the public revenue that searching operation in all governments is among the most delicate and important trusts in ours , and it will , of course , demand no inconsiderable share of my official solicitude . Under every aspect in which it can be considered it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and faithful economy . This I shall aim at the more anxiously both because it will facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt , the unnecessary duration of which is incompatible with real independence , and because it will counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a profuse expenditure of money by the Government is but too apt to engender . Powerful auxiliaries to the attainment of this desirable end are to be found in the regulations provided by the wisdom of Congress for the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt accountability of public officers . With regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view to revenue , it would seem to me that the spirit of equity , caution , and compromise in which the Constitution was formed requires that the great interests of agriculture , commerce , and manufactures should be equally favored , and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may be found essential to our national independence . Internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge , so far as they can be promoted by the constitutional acts of the Federal Government , are of high importance . Considering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of peace , I shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment , nor disregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teaches that the military should be held subordinate to the civil power . The gradual increase of our Navy , whose flag has displayed in distant climes our skill in navigation and our fame in arms the preservation of our forts , arsenals , and dockyards , and the introduction of progressive improvements in the discipline and science of both branches of our military service are so plainly prescribed by prudence that I should be excused for omitting their mention sooner than for enlarging on their importance . But the bulwark of our defense is the national militia , which in the present state of our intelligence and population must render us invincible . As long as our Government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will as long as it secures to us the rights of person and of property , liberty of conscience and of the press , it will be worth defending and so long as it is worth defending a patriotic militia will cover it with an impenetrable aegis . Partial injuries and occasional mortifications we may be subjected to , but a million of armed freemen , possessed of the means of war , can never be conquered by a foreign foe . To any just system , therefore , calculated to strengthen this natural safeguard of the country I shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power . It will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the Indian tribes within our limits a just and liberal policy , and to give that humane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our Government and the feelings of our people . The recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of Executive duties , in characters too legible to be overlooked , the task of reform , which will require particularly the correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage of the Federal Government into conflict with the freedom of elections , and the counteraction of those causes which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have placed or continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands . In the performance of a task thus generally delineated I shall endeavor to select men whose diligence and talents will insure in their respective stations able and faithful cooperation , depending for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the public officers than on their numbers . A diffidence , perhaps too just , in my own qualifications will teach me to look with reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my illustrious predecessors , and with veneration to the lights that flow from the mind that founded and the mind that reformed our system . The same diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the coordinate branches of the Government , and for the indulgence and support of my fellow citizens generally . And a firm reliance on the goodness of that Power whose providence mercifully protected our national infancy , and has since upheld our liberties in various vicissitudes , encourages me to offer up my ardent supplications that He will continue to make our beloved country the object of His divine care and gracious benediction .<speech_sep>
