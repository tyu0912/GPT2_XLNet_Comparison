Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 7th of January , 1824 , entitled An act concerning discriminating , duties of tonnage and impost , it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied within the ports of the said nation upon vessels belonging wholly to citizens of the United States , or upon merchandise the produce or manufacture thereof imported in the same , the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are , and shall be , suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said nation and the merchandise of its produce or manufacture imported into the United States in the same , the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States , and merchandise , as aforesaid , therein laden , shall be continued , and no longer and Whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me from His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Austria , through the Baron de Lederer , his consul general in the United States , that vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States are not , nor shall be , on their entering any Austrian port , from and after the 1st day of January last , subject to the payment of higher duties of tonnage than are levied on Austrian ships Now , therefore , Andrew Jackson , President of the United States of America , do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships arriving in the United States as imposed a discriminating duty between the vessels of the Empire of Austria and vessels of the United States are suspended and discontinued , the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned and to continue henceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States shall be continued in the ports of the imperial dominions of Austria . Given under my hand , at the city of Washington , this 11th day of May , 1829 , and the fifty second of the Independence L of the United States . ANDREW JACKSO<speech_sep>Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives . In my annual message at the commencement of your present session I adverted to the opposition to the revenue laws in a particular quarter of the United States , which threatened not merely to thwart their execution , but to endanger the integrity of the Union and although I then expressed my reliance that it might be overcome by the prudence of the officers of the United States and the patriotism of the people , I stated that should the emergency arise rendering the execution of the existing laws impracticable from any cause whatever prompt notice should be given to Congress , with the suggestion of such views and measures as might be necessary to meet it . Events which have occurred in the quarter then alluded to , or which have come to my knowledge subsequently , present this emergency . Since the date of my last annual message I have had officially transmitted to me by the governor of South Carolina , which I now communicate to Congress , a copy of the ordinance passed by the convention which assembled at Columbia , in the State of South Carolina , in November last , declaring certain acts of Congress therein mentioned within the limits of that State to be absolutely null and void , and making it the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as would be necessary to carry the same into effect from and after the 1st February next . The consequences to which this extraordinary defiance of the just authority of the Government might too surely lead were clearly foreseen , and it was impossible for me to hesitate as to my own duty in such an emergency . The ordinance had been passed , however , without any certain knowledge of the recommendation which , from a view of the interests of the nation at large , the Executive had determined to submit to Congress , and a hope was indulged that by frankly explaining his sentiments and the nature of those duties which the crisis would devolve upon him the authorities of South Carolina might be induced to retrace their steps . In this hope I determined to issue my proclamation of the 10th of December last , a copy of which I now lay before Congress . I regret to inform you that these reasonable expectations have not been realized , and that the several acts of the legislature of South Carolina which I now lay before you , and which have all and each of them finally passed after a knowledge of the desire of the Administration to modify the laws complained of , are too well calculated both in their positive enactments and in the spirit of opposition which they obviously encourage wholly to obstruct the collection of the revenue within the limits of that State . Up to this period neither the recommendation of the Executive in regard to our financial policy and impost system , nor the disposition manifested by Congress promptly to act upon that subject , nor the unequivocal expression of the public will in all parts of the Union appears to have produced any relaxation in the measures of opposition adopted by the State of South Carolina nor is there any reason to hope that the ordinance and laws will be abandoned . I have no knowledge that an attempt has been made , or that it is in contemplation , to reassemble either the convention or the legislature , and it will be perceived that the interval before the 1st of February is too short to admit of the preliminary steps necessary for that purpose . It appears , moreover , that the State authorities are actively organizing their military resources , and providing the means and giving the most solemn assurances of protection and support to all who shall enlist in opposition to the revenue laws . A recent proclamation of the present governor of South Carolina has openly defied the authority of the Executive of the Union , and general orders from the headquarters of the State announced his determination to accept the services of volunteers and his belief that should their country need their services they will be found at the post of honor and duty , ready to lay down their lives in her defense . Under these orders the forces referred to are directed to hold themselves in readiness to take the field at a moment s warning , and in the city of Charleston , within a collection district , and a port of entry , a rendezvous has been opened for the purpose of enlisting men for the magazine and municipal guard . Thus South Carolina presents herself in the attitude of hostile preparation , and ready even for military violence if need be to enforce her laws for preventing the collection of the duties within her limits . Proceedings thus announced and matured must be distinguished from menaces of unlawful resistance by irregular bodies of people , who , acting under temporary delusion , may be restrained by reflection and the influence of public opinion from the commission of actual outrage . In the present instance aggression may be regarded as committed when it is officially authorized and the means of enforcing it fully provided . Under these circumstances there can be no doubt that it is the determination of the authorities of South Carolina fully to carry into effect their ordinance and laws after the 1st of February . It therefore becomes my duty to bring the subject to the serious consideration of Congress , in order that such measures as they in their wisdom may deem fit shall be seasonably provided , and that it may be thereby understood that while the Government is disposed to remove all just cause of complaint as far as may be practicable consistently with a proper regard to the interests of the community at large , it is nevertheless determined that the supremacy of the laws shall be maintained . In making this communication it appears to me to be proper not only that I should lay before you the acts and proceedings of South Carolina , but that I should also fully acquaint you with those steps which I have already caused to be taken for the due collection of the revenue , and with my views of the subject generally , that the suggestions which the Constitution requires me to make in regard to your future legislation may be better understood . This subject having early attracted the anxious attention of the Executive , as soon as it was probable that the authorities of South Carolina seriously meditated resistance to the faithful execution of the revenue laws it was deemed advisable that the Secretary of the Treasury should particularly instruct the officers of the United States in that part of the Union as to the nature of the duties prescribed by the existing laws . Instructions were accordingly issued on the 6th of November to the collectors in that State , pointing out their respective duties and enjoining upon each a firm and vigilant but discreet performance of them in the emergency then apprehended . I herewith transmit copies of these instructions and of the letter addressed to the district attorney , requesting his cooperation . These instructions were dictated in the hope that as the opposition to the laws by the anomalous proceeding of nullification was represented to be of a pacific nature , to be pursued substantially according to the forms of the Constitution and without resorting in any event to force or violence , the measures of its advocates would be taken in conformity with that profession , and on such supposition the means afforded by the existing laws would have been adequate to meet any emergency likely to arise . It was , however , not possible altogether to suppress apprehension of the excesses to which the excitement prevailing in that quarter might lead , but it certainly was not foreseen that the meditated obstruction to the laws would so soon openly assume its present character . Subsequently to the date of those instructions , however , the ordinance of the convention was passed , which , if complied with by the people of the State , must effectually render inoperative the present revenue laws within her limits . That ordinance declares and ordains That the several acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the United States purporting to be laws for the imposing of duties and imposts on the importation of foreign commodities , and now having operation and effect within the United States , and more especially An act in alteration of the several acts imposing duties on imports , approved on the 19th of May , 1828 , and also an act entitled An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties on imports , approved on the 14th July , 1832 , are unauthorized by the Constitution of the United States , and violate the true intent and meaning thereof , and are null and void and no law , nor binding upon the State of South Carolina , its officers and citizens and all promises , contracts , and obligations made or entered into , or to be made or entered into , with purpose to secure the duties imposed by the said acts , and all judicial proceedings which shall be hereafter had in affirmance thereof , are and shall be held utterly null and void . It also ordains That it shall not be lawful for any of the constituted authorities , whether of the State of South Carolina or of the United States , to enforce the payment of duties imposed by the said acts within the limits of the State , but that it shall be the duty of the legislature to adopt such measures and pass such acts as may be necessary to give full effect to this ordinance and to prevent the enforcement and arrest the operation of the said acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the United States within the limits of the State from and after the 1st of February next and it shall be the duty of all other constituted authorities and of all other persons residing or being within the limits of the State , and they are hereby required and enjoined , to obey and give effect to this ordinance and such acts and measures of the legislature as may be passed or adopted in obedience thereto . It further ordains That in no case of law or equity decided in the courts of the State wherein shall be drawn in question the authority of this ordinance , or the validity of such act or acts of the legislature as may be passed for the purpose of giving effect thereto , or the validity of the aforesaid acts of Congress imposing duties , shall any appeal be taken or allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States , nor shall any copy of the record be permitted or allowed for that purpose and the person or persons attempting to take such appeal may be dealt with as for a contempt of court . It likewise ordains That all persons holding any office of honor , profit , or trust , civil or military , under the State shall , within such time and in such manner as the legislature shall prescribe , take an oath well and truly to obey , execute , and enforce this ordinance and such act or acts of the legislature as may be passed in pursuance thereof , according to the true intent and meaning of the same and on the neglect or omission of any such person or persons so to do his or their office or offices shall be forthwith vacated , and shall be filled up as if such person or persons were dead or had resigned . And no person hereafter elected to any office of honor , profit , or trust , civil or military , shall , until the legislature shall otherwise provide and direct , enter on the execution of his office or be in any respect competent to discharge the duties thereof until he shall in like manner have taken a similar oath and no juror shall be empaneled in any of the courts of the State in any cause in which shall be in question this ordinance or any act of the legislature passed in pursuance thereof , unless he shall first , in addition to the usual oath , have taken an oath that he will well and truly obey , execute , and enforce this ordinance and such act or acts of the legislature as may be passed to carry the same into operation and effect , according to the true intent and meaning thereof . The ordinance concludes And we , the people of South Carolina , to the end that it may be fully understood by the Government of the United States and the people of the co States that we are determined to maintain this ordinance and declaration at every hazard , do further declare that we will not submit to the application of force on the part of the Federal Government to reduce this State to obedience , but that we will consider the passage by Congress of any act authorizing the employment of a military or naval force against the State of South Carolina , her constituted authorities or citizens , or any act abolishing or closing the ports of this State , or any of them , or otherwise obstructing the free ingress and egress of vessels to and from the said ports , or any other act on the part of the Federal Government to coerce the State , shut up her ports , destroy or harass her commerce , or to enforce the acts hereby declared to be null and void , otherwise than through the civil tribunals of the country , as inconsistent with the longer continuance of South Carolina in the Union and that the people of this State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the other States , and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government and to do all other acts and things which sovereign and independent states may of right do . This solemn denunciation of the laws and authority of the United States has been followed up by a series of acts on the part of the authorities of that State which manifest a determination to render inevitable a resort to those measures of self defense which the paramount duty of the Federal Government requires , but upon the adoption of which that State will proceed to execute the purpose it has avowed in this ordinance of withdrawing from the Union . On the 27th of November the legislature assembled at Columbia , and on their meeting the governor laid before them the ordinance of the convention . In his message on that occasion he acquaints them that this ordinance has thus become a part of the fundamental law of South Carolina that the die has been at last cast , and South Carolina has at length appealed to her ulterior sovereignty as a member of this Confederacy and has planted herself on her reserved rights . The rightful exercise of this power is not a question which we shall any longer argue . It is sufficient that she has willed it , and that the act is done nor is its strict compatibility with our constitutional obligation to all laws passed by the General Government within the authorized grants of power to be drawn in question when this interposition is exerted in a case in which the compact has been palpably , deliberately , and dangerously violated . That it brings up a conjuncture of deep and momentous interest is neither to be concealed nor denied . This crisis presents a class of duties which is referable to yourselves . You have been commanded by the people in their highest sovereignty to take care that within the limits of this State their will shall be obeyed . The measure of legislation , he says , which you have to employ at this crisis is the precise amount of such enactments as may be necessary to render it utterly impossible to collect within our limits the duties imposed by the protective tariffs thus nullified . He proceeds That you should arm every citizen with a civil process by which he may claim , if he pleases , a restitution of his goods seized under the existing imposts on his giving security to abide the issue of a suit at law , and at the same time define what shall constitute treason against the State , and by a bill of pains and penalties compel obedience and punish disobedience to your own laws , are points too obvious to require any discussion . In one word , you must survey the whole ground . You must look to and provide for all possible contingencies . In your own limits your own courts of judicature must not only be supreme , but you must look to the ultimate issue of any conflict of jurisdiction and power between them and the courts of the United States . The governor also asks for power to grant clearances , in violation of the laws of the Union and to prepare for the alternative which must happen unless the United States shall passively surrender their authority , and the Executive , disregarding his oath , refrain from executing the laws of the Union , he recommends a thorough revision of the militia system , and that the governor be authorized to accept for the defense of Charleston and its dependencies the services of 2 , 000 volunteers , either by companies or files , and that they be formed into a legionary brigade consisting of infantry , riflemen , cavalry , field and heavy artillery , and that they be armed and equipped from the public arsenals completely for the field , and that appropriations be made for supplying all deficiencies in our munitions of war . In addition to these volunteer drafts , he recommends that the governor be authorized to accept the services of 10 , 000 volunteers from the other divisions of the State , to be organized and arranged in regiments and brigades , the officers to be selected by the commander in chief , and that this whole force be called the State guard . A request has been regularly made of the secretary of state of South Carolina for authentic copies of the acts which have been passed for the purpose of enforcing the ordinance , but up to the date of the latest advices that request had not been complied with , and on the present occasion , therefore , reference can only be made to those acts as published in the newspapers of the State . The acts to which it is deemed proper to invite the particular attention of Congress are First . An act to carry into effect , in part , an ordinance to nullify certain acts of the Congress of the United States purporting to be laws laying duties on the importation of foreign commodities , passed in convention of this State , at Columbia , on the 24th November , 1832 . This act provides that any goods seized or detained under pretense of securing the duties , or for the nonpayment of duties , or under any process , order , or decree , or other pretext contrary to the intent and meaning of the ordinance may be recovered by the owner or consignee by an act of replevin that in case of refusing to deliver them , or removing them so that the replevin can not be executed , the sheriff may seize the personal estate of the offender to double the amount of the goods , and if any attempt shall be made to retake or seize them it is the duty of the sheriff to recapture them and that any person who shall disobey the process or remove the goods , or anyone who shall attempt to retake or seize the goods under pretense of securing the duties , or for nonpayment of duties , or under any process or decree contrary to the intent of the ordinance , shall be fined and imprisoned , besides being liable for any other offense involved in the act . It also provides that any person arrested or imprisoned on any judgment or decree obtained in any Federal court for duties shall be entitled to the benefit secured by the habeas corpus act of the State in cases of unlawful arrest , and may maintain an action for damages , and that if any estate shall be sold under such judgment or decree the sale shall be held illegal . It also provides that any jailer who receives a person committed on any process or other judicial proceedings to enforce the payment of duties , and anyone who hires his house as a jail to receive such persons , shall be fined and imprisoned . And , finally , it provides that persons paying duties may recover them back with interest . The next is called An act to provide for the security and protection of the people of the State of South Carolina . This act provides that if the Government of the United States or any officer thereof shall , by the employment of naval or military force , attempt to coerce the State of South Carolina into submission to the acts of Congress declared by the ordinance null and void , or to resist the enforcement of the ordinance or of the laws passed in pursuance thereof , or in case of any armed or forcible resistance thereto , the governor is authorized to resist the same and to order into service the whole or so much of the military force of the State as he may deem necessary and that in case of any overt act of coercion or intention to commit the same , manifested by an unusual assemblage of naval or military forces in or near the State , or the occurrence of any circumstances indicating that armed force is about to be employed against the State or in resistance to its laws , the governor is authorized to accept the services of such volunteers and call into service such portions of the militia as may be required to meet the emergency . The act also provides for accepting the service of the volunteers and organizing the militia , embracing all free white males between the ages of 16 and 60 , and for the purchase of arms , ordnance , and ammunition . It also declares that the power conferred on the governor shall be applicable to all cases of insurrection or invasion , or imminent danger thereof , and to cases where the laws of the State shall be opposed and the execution thereof forcibly resisted by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the power vested in the sheriffs and other civil officers , and declares it to be the duty of the governor in every such case to call forth such portions of the militia and volunteers as may be necessary promptly to suppress such combinations and cause the laws of the State to be executed . No . 9 is An act concerning the oath required by the ordinance passed in convention at Columbia on the 24th of November , 1832 . This act prescribes the form of the oath , which is , to obey and execute the ordinance and all acts passed by the legislature in pursuance thereof , and directs the time and manner of taking it by the officers of the State civil , judiciary , and military . It is believed that other acts have been passed embracing provisions for enforcing the ordinance , but I have not yet been able to procure them . I transmit , however , a copy of Governor Hamilton s message to the legislature of South Carolina of Governor Hayne s inaugural address to the same body , as also of his proclamation , and a general order of the governor and commander in chief , dated the 20th of December , giving public notice that the services of volunteers will be accepted under the act already referred to . If these measures can not be defeated and overcome by the power conferred by the Constitution on the Federal Government , the Constitution must be considered as incompetent to its own defense , the supremacy of the laws is at an end , and the rights and liberties of the citizens can no longer receive protection from the Government of the Union . They not only abrogate the acts of Congress commonly called the tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 , but they prostrate and sweep away at once and without exception every act and every part of every act imposing any amount whatever of duty on any foreign merchandise , and virtually every existing act which has ever been passed authorizing the collection of the revenue , including the act of 1816 , and also the collection law of 1799 , the constitutionality of which has never been questioned . It is not only those duties which are charged to have been imposed for the protection of manufactures that are thereby repealed , but all others , though laid for the purpose of revenue merely , and upon articles in no degree suspected of being objects of protection . The whole revenue system of the United States in South Carolina is obstructed and overthrown , and the Government is absolutely prohibited from collecting any part of the public revenue within the limits of that State . Henceforth , not only the citizens of South Carolina and of the United States , but the subjects of foreign states may import any description or quantity of merchandise into the ports of South Carolina without the payment of any duty whatsoever . That State is thus relieved from the payment of any part of the public burthens , and duties and imposts are not only rendered not uniform throughout the United States , but a direct and ruinous preference is given to the ports of that State over those of all the other States of the Union , in manifest violation of the positive provisions of the Constitution . In point of duration , also , those aggressions upon the authority of Congress which by the ordinance are made part of the fundamental law of South Carolina are absolute , indefinite , and without limitation . They neither prescribe the period when they shall cease nor indicate any conditions upon which those who have thus undertaken to arrest the operation of the laws are to retrace their steps and rescind their measures . They offer to the United States no alternative but unconditional submission . If the scope of the ordinance is to be received as the scale of concession , their demands can be satisfied only by a repeal of the whole system of revenue laws and by abstaining from the collection of any duties and imposts whatsoever . It is true that in the address to the people of the United States by the convention of South Carolina , after announcing the fixed and final determination of the State in relation to the protecting system , they say that it remains for us to submit a plan of taxation in which we would be willing to acquiesce in a liberal spirit of concession , provided we are met in due time and in a becoming spirit by the States interested in manufactures . In the opinion of the convention , an equitable plan would be that the whole list of protected articles should be imported free of all duty , and that the revenue derived from import duties should be raised exclusively from the unprotected articles , or that whenever a duty is imposed upon protected articles imported an excise duty of the same rate shall be imposed upon all similar articles manufactured in the United States . The address proceeds to state , however , that they are willing to make a large offering to preserve the Union , and , with a distinct declaration that it is a concession on our part , we will consent that the same rate of duty may be imposed upon the protected articles that shall be imposed upon the unprotected , provided that no more revenue be raised than is necessary to meet the demands of the Government for constitutional purposes , and provided also that a duty substantially uniform be imposed upon all foreign imports . It is also true that in his message to the legislature , when urging the necessity of providing means of securing their safety by ample resources for repelling force by force , the governor of South Carolina observes that he can not but think that on a calm and dispassionate review by Congress and the functionaries of the General Government of the true merits of this controversy the arbitration by a call of a convention of all the States , which we sincerely and anxiously seek and desire , will be accorded to us . From the diversity of terms indicated in these two important documents , taken in connection with the progress of recent events in that quarter , there is too much reason to apprehend , without in any manner doubting the intentions of those public functionaries , that neither the terms proposed in the address of the convention nor those alluded to in the message of the governor would appease the excitement which has led to the present excesses . It is obvious , however , that should the latter be insisted on they present an alternative which the General Government of itself can by no possibility grant , since by an express provision of the Constitution Congress can call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments only on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the States . And it is not perceived that the terms presented in the address are more practicable than those referred to in the message . It will not escape attention that the conditions on which it is said in the address of the convention they would be willing to acquiesce form no part of the ordinance . While this ordinance bears all the solemnity of a fundamental law , is to be authoritative upon all within the limits of South Carolina , and is absolute and unconditional in its terms , the address conveys only the sentiments of the convention , in no binding or practical form one is the act of the State , the other only the expression of the opinions of the members of the convention . To limit the effect of that solemn act by any terms or conditions whatever , they should have been embodied in it , and made of import no less authoritative than the act itself . By the positive enactments of the ordinance the execution of the laws of the Union is absolutely prohibited , and the address offers no other prospect of their being again restored , even in the modified form proposed , than what depends upon the improbable contingency that amid changing events and increasing excitement the sentiments of the present members of the convention and of their successors will remain the same . It is to be regretted , however , that these conditions , even if they had been offered in the same binding form , are so undefined , depend upon so many contingencies , and are so directly opposed to the known opinions and interests of the great body of the American people as to be almost hopeless of attainment . The majority of the States and of the people will certainly not consent that the protecting duties shall be wholly abrogated , never to be reenacted at any future time or in any possible contingency . As little practicable is it to provide that the same rate of duty shall be imposed upon the protected articles that shall be imposed upon the unprotected , which , moreover , would be severely oppressive to the poor , and in time of war would add greatly to its rigors . And though there can be no objection to the principle , properly understood , that no more revenue shall be raised than is necessary for the constitutional purposes of the Government , which principle has been already recommended by the Executive as the true basis of taxation , yet it is very certain that South Carolina alone can not be permitted to decide what these constitutional purposes are . The period which constitutes the due time in which the terms proposed in the address are to be accepted would seem to present scarcely less difficulty than the terms themselves . Though the revenue laws are already declared to be void in South Carolina , as well as the bonds taken under them and the judicial proceedings for carrying them into effect , yet as the full action and operation of the ordinance are to be suspended until the 1st of February the interval may be assumed as the time within which it is expected that the most complicated portion of the national legislation , a system of long standing and affecting great interests in the community , is to be rescinded and abolished . If this be required , it is clear that a compliance is impossible . In the uncertainty , then , that exists as to the duration of the ordinance and of the enactments for enforcing it , it becomes imperiously the duty of the Executive of the United States , acting with a proper regard to all the great interests committed to his care , to treat those acts as absolute and unlimited . They are so as far as his agency is concerned . He can not either embrace or lead to the performance of the conditions . He has already discharged the only part in his power by the recommendation in his annual message . The rest is with Congress and the people , and until they have acted his duty will require him to look to the existing state of things and act under them according to his high obligations . By these various proceedings , therefore , the State of South Carolina has forced the General Government , unavoidably , to decide the new and dangerous alternative of permitting a State to obstruct the execution of the laws within its limits or seeing it attempt to execute a threat of withdrawing from the Union . That portion of the people at present exercising the authority of the State solemnly assert their right to do either and as solemnly announce their determination to do one or the other . In my opinion , both purposes are to be regarded as revolutionary in their character and tendency , and subversive of the supremacy of the laws and of the integrity of the Union . The result of each is the same , since a State in which , by an usurpation of power , the constitutional authority of the Federal Government is openly defied and set aside wants only the form to be independent of the Union . The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other States from their most solemn obligations , and hazard the liberties and happiness of the millions composing this Union , can not be acknowledged . Such authority is believed to be utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which the General Government is constituted and to the objects which it is expressly formed to attain . Against all acts which may be alleged to transcend the constitutional power of the Government , or which may be inconvenient or oppressive in their operation , the Constitution itself has prescribed the modes of redress . It is the acknowledged attribute of free institutions that under them the empire of reason and law is substituted for the power of the sword . To no other source can appeals for supposed wrongs be made consistently with the obligations of South Carolina to no other can such appeals be made with safety at any time and to their decisions , when constitutionally pronounced , it becomes the duty no less of the public authorities than of the people in every case to yield a patriotic submission . That a State or any other great portion of the people , suffering under long and intolerable oppression and having tried all constitutional remedies without the hope of redress , may have a natural right , when their happiness can be no otherwise secured , and when they can do so without greater injury to others , to absolve themselves from their obligations to the Government and appeal to the last resort , needs not on the present occasion be denied . The existence of this right , however , must depend upon the causes which may justify its exercise . It is the ultima ratio , which presupposes that the proper appeals to all other means of redress have been made in good faith , and which can never be rightfully resorted to unless it be unavoidable . It is not the right of the State , but of the individual , and of all the individuals in the State . It is the right of mankind generally to secure by all means in their power the blessings of liberty and happiness but when for these purposes any body of men have voluntarily associated themselves under a particular form of government , no portion of them can dissolve the association without acknowledging the correlative right in the remainder to decide whether that dissolution can be permitted consistently with the general happiness . In this view it is a right dependent upon the power to enforce it . Such a right , though may be admitted to preexist and can not be wholly surrendered , is necessarily subjected to limitations in all free governments , and in compacts of all kinds freely and voluntarily entered into , and in which the interest and welfare of the individual become identified with those of the community of which he is a member . In compacts between individuals , however deeply they may affect their relations , these principles are acknowledged to create a sacred obligation and in compacts of civil government , involving the liberties and happiness of millions of mankind , the obligation can not be less . Without adverting to the particular theories to which the federal compact has given rise , both as to its formation and the parties to it , and without inquiring whether it be merely federal or social or national , it is sufficient that it must be admitted to be a compact and to possess the obligations incident to a compact to be a compact by which power is created on the one hand and obedience exacted on the other a compact freely , voluntarily , and solemnly entered into by the several States and ratified by the people thereof , respectively a compact by which the several States and the people thereof , respectively , have bound themselves to each other and to the Federal Government , and by which the Federal Government is bound to the several States and to every citizen of the United States . To this compact , in whatever mode it may have been done , the people of South Carolina have freely and voluntarily given their assent , and to the whole and every part of it they are , upon every principle of good faith , inviolably bound . Under this obligation they are bound and should be required to contribute their portion of the public expense , and to submit to all laws made by the common consent , in pursuance of the Constitution , for the common defense and general welfare , until they can be changed in the mode which the compact has provided for the attainment of those great ends of the Government and of the Union . Nothing less than causes which would justify revolutionary remedy can absolve the people from this obligation , and for nothing less can the Government permit it to be done without violating its own obligations , by which , under the compact , it is bound to the other States and to every citizen of the United States . These deductions plainly flow from the nature of the federal compact , which is one of limitations , not only upon the powers originally possessed by the parties thereto , but also upon those conferred on the Government and every department thereof . It will be freely conceded that by the principles of our system all power is vested in the people , but to be exercised in the mode and subject to the checks which the people themselves have prescribed . These checks are undoubtedly only different modifications of the same great popular principle which lies at the foundation of the whole , but are not on that account to be less regarded or less obligatory . Upon the power of Congress , the veto of the Executive and the authority of the judiciary , which is to extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof , are the obvious checks , and the sound action of public opinion , with the ultimate power of amendment , are the salutary and only limitation upon the powers of the whole . However it may be alleged that a violation of the compact by the measures of the Government can affect the obligations of the parties , it can not even be pretended that such violation can be predicated of those measures until all the constitutional remedies shall have been fully tried . If the Federal Government exercise powers not warranted by the Constitution , and immediately affecting individuals , it will scarcely be denied that the proper remedy is a recourse to the judiciary . Such undoubtedly is the remedy for those who deem the acts of Congress laying duties and imposts , and providing for their collection , to be unconstitutional . The whole operation of such laws is upon the individuals importing the merchandise . A State is absolutely prohibited from laying imposts or duties on imports or exports without the consent of Congress , and can not become a party under these laws without importing in her own name or wrongfully interposing her authority against them . By thus interposing , however , she can not rightfully obstruct the operation of the laws upon individuals . For their disobedience to or violation of the laws the ordinary remedies through the judicial tribunals would remain . And in a case where an individual should be prosecuted for any offense against the laws , he could not set up in justification of his act a law of the State , which , being unconstitutional , would therefore be regarded as null and void . The law of a State can not authorize the commission of a crime against the United States or any other act which , according to the supreme law of the Union , would be otherwise unlawful and it is equally clear that if there be any case in which a State , as such , is affected by the law beyond the scope of judicial power , the remedy consists in appeals to the people , either to effect a change in the representation or to procure relief by an amendment of the Constitution . But the measures of the Government are to be recognized as valid , and consequently supreme , until these remedies shall have been effectually tried , and any attempt to subvert those measures or to render the laws subordinate to State authority , and afterwards to resort to constitutional redress , is worse than evasive . It would not be a proper resistance to a government of unlimited powers , as has been sometimes pretended , but unlawful opposition to the very limitations on which the harmonious action of the Government and all its parts absolutely depends . South Carolina has appealed to none of these remedies , but in effect has defied them all . While threatening to separate from the Union if any attempt be made to enforce the revenue laws otherwise than through the civil tribunals of the country , she has not only not appealed in her own name to those tribunals which the Constitution has provided for all cases in law or equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States , but has endeavored to frustrate their proper action on her citizens by drawing the cognizance of cases under the revenue laws to her own tribunals , specially prepared and fitted for the purpose of enforcing the acts passed by the State to obstruct those laws , and both the judges and jurors of which will be bound by the import of oaths previously taken to treat the Constitution and laws of the United States in this respect as a nullity . Nor has the State made the proper appeal to public opinion and to the remedy of amendment for without waiting to learn whether the other States will consent to a convention , or if they do will construe or amend the Constitution to suit her views , she has of her own authority altered the import of that instrument and given immediate effect to the change . In fine , she has set her own will and authority above the laws , has made herself arbiter in her own cause , and has passed at once over all intermediate steps to measures of avowed resistance , which , unless they be submitted to , can be enforced only by the sword . In deciding upon the course which a high sense of duty to all the people of the United States imposes upon the authorities of the Union in this emergency , it can not be overlooked that there is no sufficient cause for the acts of South Carolina , or for her thus placing in jeopardy the happiness of so many millions of people . Misrule and oppression , to warrant the disruption of the free institutions of the Union of these States , should be great and lasting , defying all other remedy . For causes of minor character the Government could not submit to such a catastrophe without a violation of its most sacred obligations to the other States of the Union who have submitted their destiny to its hands . There is in the present instance no such cause , either in the degree of misrule or oppression complained of or in the hopelessness of redress by constitutional means . The long sanction they have received from the proper authorities and from the people , not less than the unexampled growth and increasing prosperity of so many millions of freemen , attest that no such oppression as would justify , or even palliate , such a resort can be justly imputed either to the present policy or past measures of the Federal Government . The same mode of collecting duties , and for the same general objects , which began with the foundation of the Government , and which has conducted the country through its subsequent steps to its present enviable condition of happiness and renown , has not been changed . Taxation and representation , the great principle of the American Revolution , have continually gone hand in hand , and at all times and in every instance no tax of any kind has been imposed without their participation , and , in some instances which have been complained of , with the express assent of a part of the representatives of South Carolina in the councils of the Government . Up to the present period no revenue has been raised beyond the necessary wants of the country and the authorized expenditures of the Government and as soon as the burthen of the public debt is removed those charged with the administration have promptly recommended a corresponding reduction of revenue . That this system thus pursued has resulted in no such oppression upon South Carolina needs no other proof than the solemn and official declaration of the late chief magistrate of that State in his address to the legislature . In that he says that The occurrences of the past year , in connection with our domestic concerns , are to be reviewed with a sentiment of fervent gratitude to the Great Disposer of Human Events that tributes of grateful acknowledgment are due for the various and multiplied blessings He has been pleased to bestow on our people that abundant harvests in every quarter of the State have crowned the exertions of agricultural labor that health almost beyond former precedent has blessed our homes , and that there is not less reason for thankfulness in surveying our social condition . It would indeed be difficult to imagine oppression where in the social condition of a people there was equal cause of thankfulness as for abundant harvests and varied and multiplied blessings with which a kind providence had favored them . Independently of these considerations , it will not escape observation that South Carolina still claims to be a component part of the Union , to participate in the national councils and to share in the public benefits without contributing to the public burdens , thus asserting the dangerous anomaly of continuing in an association without acknowledging any other obligation to its laws than what depends upon her own will . In this posture of affairs the duty of the Government seems to be plain . It inculcates a recognition of that State as a member of the Union and subject to its authority , a vindication of the just power of the Constitution , the preservation of the integrity of the Union , and the execution of the laws by all constitutional means . The Constitution , which his oath of office obliges him to support , declares that the Executive shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and in providing that he shall from time to time give to Congress information of the state of the Union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient , imposes the additional obligation of recommending to Congress such more efficient provision for executing the laws as may from time to time be found requisite . The same instrument confers on Congress the power not merely to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare , but to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into effect the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States or in any department or officer thereof , and also to provide for calling forth the militia for executing the laws of the Union . In all cases similar to the present the duties of the Government become the measure of its powers , and whenever it fails to exercise a power necessary and proper to the discharge of the duty prescribed by the Constitution it violates the public trusts not less than it would in transcending its proper limits . To refrain , therefore , from the high and solemn duties thus enjoined , however painful the performance may be , and thereby tacitly permit the rightful authority of the Government to be contemned and its laws obstructed by a single State , would neither comport with its own safety nor the rights of the great body of the American people . It being thus shown to be the duty of the Executive to execute the laws by all constitutional means , it remains to consider the extent of those already at his disposal and what it may be proper further to provide . In the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury to the collectors in South Carolina the provisions and regulations made by the act of 1799 , and also the fines , penalties , and forfeitures for their enforcement , are particularly detailed and explained . It may be well apprehended , however , that these provisions may prove inadequate to meet such an open , powerful , organized opposition as is to be commenced after the 1st of February next . Subsequently to the date of these instructions and to the passage of the ordinance , information has been received from sources entitled to be relied on that owing to the popular excitement in the State and the effect of the ordinance declaring the execution of the revenue laws unlawful a sufficient number of persons in whom confidence might be placed could not be induced to accept the office of inspector to oppose with any probability of success the force which will no doubt be used when an attempt is made to remove vessels and their cargoes from the custody of the officers of the customs , and , indeed , that it would be impracticable for the collector , with the aid of any number of inspectors whom he may be authorized to employ , to preserve the custody against such an attempt . The removal of the custom house from Charleston to Castle Pinckney was deemed a measure of necessary precaution , and though the authority to give that direction is not questioned , it is nevertheless apparent that a similar precaution can not be observed in regard to the ports of Georgetown and Beaufort , each of which under the present laws remains a port of entry and exposed to the obstructions meditated in that quarter . In considering the best means of avoiding or of preventing the apprehended obstruction to the collection of the revenue , and the consequences which may ensue , it would appear to be proper and necessary to enable the officers of the customs to preserve the custody of vessels and their cargoes , which by the existing laws they are required to take , until the duties to which they are liable shall be paid or secured . The mode by which it is contemplated to deprive them of that custody is the process of replevin and that of capias in withernam , in the nature of a distress from the State tribunals organized by the ordinance . Against the proceeding in the nature of a distress it is not perceived that the collector can interpose any resistance whatever , and against the process of replevin authorized by the law of the State he , having no common law power , can only oppose such inspectors as he is by statute authorized and may find it practicable to employ , and these , from the information already adverted to , are shown to be wholly inadequate . The respect which that process deserves must therefore be considered . If the authorities of South Carolina had not obstructed the legitimate action of the courts of the United States , or if they had permitted the State tribunals to administer the law according to their oath under the Constitution and the regulations of the laws of the Union , the General Government might have been content to look to them for maintaining the custody and to encounter the other inconveniences arising out of the recent proceedings . Even in that case , however , the process of replevin from the courts of the State would be irregular and unauthorized . It has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that the courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction of all seizures made on land or water for a breach of the laws of the United States , and any intervention of a State authority which , by taking the thing seized out of the hands of the United States officer , might obstruct the exercise of this jurisdiction is unlawful that in such case the court of the United States having cognizance of the seizure may enforce a redelivery of the thing by attachment or other summary process that the question under such a seizure whether a forfeiture has been actually incurred belongs exclusively to the courts of the United States , and it depends on the final decree whether the seizure is to be deemed rightful or tortuous and that not until the seizure be finally judged wrongful and without probable cause by the courts of the United States can the party proceed at common law for damages in the State courts . But by making it unlawful for any of the constituted authorities , whether of the United States or of the State , to enforce the laws for the payment of duties , and declaring that all judicial proceedings which shall be hereafter had in affirmance of the contracts made with purpose to secure the duties imposed by the said acts are and shall be held utterly null and void , she has in effect abrogated the judicial tribunals within her limits in this respect , has virtually denied the United States access to the courts established by their own laws , and declared it unlawful for the judges to discharge those duties which they are sworn to perform . In lieu of these she has substituted those State tribunals already adverted to , the judges whereof are not merely forbidden to allow an appeal or permit a copy of their record , but are previously sworn to disregard the laws of the Union and enforce those only of South Carolina , and thus deprived of the function essential to the judicial character of inquiring into the validity of the law and the right of the matter , become merely ministerial instruments in aid of the concerted obstruction of the laws of the Union . Neither the process nor authority of these tribunals thus constituted can be respected consistently with the supremacy of the laws or the rights and security of the citizen . If they be submitted to , the protection due from the Government to its officers and citizens is withheld , and there is at once an end not only to the laws , but to the Union itself . Against such a force as the sheriff may , and which by the replevin law of South Carolina it is his duty to exercise , it can not be expected that a collector can retain his custody with the aid of the inspectors . In such case , it is true , it would be competent to institute suits in the United States courts against those engaged in the unlawful proceeding , or the property might be seized for a violation of the revenue laws , and , being libeled in the proper courts , an order might be made for its redelivery , which would be committed to the marshal for execution . But in that case the fourth section of the act , in broad and unqualified terms , makes it the duty of the sheriff to prevent such recapture or seizure , or to redeliver the goods , as the case may be , even under any process , order , or decrees , or other pretext contrary to the true intent and meaning of the ordinance aforesaid . It is thus made the duty of the sheriff to oppose the process of the courts of the United States , and for that purpose , if need be , to employ the whole power of the county . And the act expressly reserves to him all power which , independently of its provisions , he could have used . In this reservation it obviously contemplates a resort to other means than those particularly mentioned . It is not to be disguised that the power which it is thus enjoined upon the sheriff to employ is nothing less than the posse comitatus in all the rigor of the ancient common law . This power , though it may be used against unlawful resistance to judicial process , is in its character forcible , and analogous to that conferred upon the marshals by the act of 1795 . It is , in fact , the embodying of the whole mass of the population , under the command of a single individual , to accomplish by their forcible aid what could not be effected peaceably and by the ordinary means . It may properly be said to be a relic of those ages in which the laws could be defended rather by physical than moral force , and in its origin was conferred upon the sheriffs of England to enable them to defend their county against any of the King s enemies when they came into the land , as well as for the purpose of executing process . In early and less civilized times it was intended to include the aid and attendance of all knights and others who were bound to have harness . It includes the right of going with arms and military equipment , and embraces larger classes and greater masses of population than can be compelled by the laws of most of the States to perform militia duty . If the principles of the common law are recognized in South Carolina and from this act it would seem they are , the power of summoning the posse comitatus will compel , under the penalty of fine and imprisonment , every man over the age of 15 , and able to travel , to turn out at the call of the sheriff , and with such weapons as may be necessary and it my justify beating , and even killing , such as may resist . The use of the posse comitatus is therefore a direct application of force , and can not be otherwise regarded than as the employment of the whole militia force of the county , and in an equally efficient form under a different name . No proceeding which resorts to this power to the extent contemplated by the act can be properly denominated peaceable . The act of South Carolina , however , does not rely altogether upon this forcible remedy . For even attempting to resist or disobey , though by the aid only of the ordinary officers of the customs , the process of replevin , the collector and all concerned are subjected to a further proceeding in the nature of a distress of their personal effects , and are , moreover , made guilty of a misdemeanor , and liable to be punished by a fine of not less than 1 , 000 nor more than 5 , 000 and to imprisonment not exceeding two years and not less than six months and for even attempting to execute the order of the court for retaking the property the marshal and all assisting would be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine of not less than 3 , 000 nor more than 10 , 000 and to imprisonment not exceeding two years nor less than one and in case the goods should be retaken under such process it is made the absolute duty of the sheriff to retake them . It is not to be supposed that in the face of these penalties , aided by the powerful force of the county , which would doubtless be brought to sustain the State officers , either that the collector would retain the custody in the first instance or that the marshal could summon sufficient aid to retake the property pursuant to the order or other process of the court . It is , moreover , obvious that in this conflict between the powers of the officers of the United States and of the State unless the latter be passively submitted to the destruction to which the property of the officers of the customs would be exposed , the commission of actual violence , and the loss of lives would be scarcely avoidable . Under these circumstances and the provisions of the acts of South Carolina the execution of the laws is rendered impracticable even through the ordinary judicial tribunals of the United States . There would certainly be fewer difficulties , and less opportunity of actual collision between the officers of the United States and of the State , and the collection of the revenue would be more effectually secured if , indeed , it can be done in any other way by placing the custom house beyond the immediate power of the county . For this purpose it might be proper to provide that whenever by any unlawful combination or obstruction in any State or in any port it should become impracticable faithfully to collect the duties , the President of the United States should be authorized to alter and abolish such of the districts and ports of entry as should be necessary , and to establish the custom house at some secure place within some port or harbor of such State and in such cases it should be the duty of the collector to reside at such place , and to detain all vessels and cargoes until the duties imposed by law should be properly secured or paid in cash , deducting interest that in such cases it should be unlawful to take the vessel and cargo from the custody of the proper officer of the customs unless by process from the ordinary judicial tribunals of the United States , and that in case of an attempt otherwise to take the property by a force too great to be overcome by the officers of the customs it should be lawful to protect the possession of the officers by the employment of the land and naval forces and militia , under provisions similar to those authorized by the eleventh section of the act of the 9th of January , 1809 . This provision , however , would not shield the officers and citizens of the United States , acting under the laws , from suits and prosecutions in the tribunals of the State which might thereafter be brought against them , nor would it protect their property from the proceeding by distress , and it may well be apprehended that it would be insufficient to insure a proper respect to the process of the constitutional tribunals in prosecutions for offenses against the United States and to protect the authorities of the United States , whether judicial or ministerial , in the performance of their duties . It would , moreover , be inadequate to extend the protection due from the Government to that portion of the people of South Carolina against outrage and oppression of any kind who may manifest their attachment and yield obedience to the laws of the Union . It may therefore be desirable to revive , with some modifications better adapted to the occasion , the sixth section of the act of the 3d March , 1815 , which expired on the 4th March , 1817 , by the limitation of that of 27th April , 1816 , and to provide that in any case where suit shall be brought against any individual in the courts of the State for any act done under the laws of the United States he should be authorized to remove the said cause by petition into the circuit court of the United States without any copy of the record , and that the court should proceed to hear and determine the same as if it had been originally instituted therein and that in all cases of injuries to the persons or property of individuals for disobedience to the ordinance and laws of South Carolina in pursuance thereof redress may be sought in the courts of the United States . It may be expedient also , by modifying the resolution of the 3d March , 1791 , to authorize the marshals to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoners committed under the authority of the United States . Provisions less than these , consisting as they do for the most part rather of a revival of the policy of former acts called for by the existing emergency than of the introduction of any unusual or rigorous enactments , would not cause the laws of the Union to be properly respected or enforced . It is believed these would prove adequate unless the military forces of the State of South Carolina authorized by the late act of the legislature should be actually embodied and called out in aid of their proceedings and of the provisions of the ordinance generally . Even in that case , however , it is believed that no more will be necessary than a few modifications of its terms to adapt the act of 1795 to the present emergency , as by that act the provisions of the law of 1792 were accommodated to the crisis then existing , and by conferring authority upon the President to give it operation during the session of Congress , and without the ceremony of a proclamation , whenever it shall be officially made known to him by the authority of any State , or by the courts of the United States , that within the limits of such State the laws of the United States will be openly opposed and their execution obstructed by the actual employment of military force , or by any unlawful means whatsoever too great to be otherwise overcome . In closing this communication , I should do injustice to my own feelings not to express my confident reliance upon the disposition of each department of the Government to perform its duty and to cooperate in all measures necessary in the present emergency . The crisis undoubtedly invokes the fidelity of the patriot and the sagacity of the statesman , not more in removing such portion of the public burden as may be necessary than in preserving the good order of society and in the maintenance of well regulated liberty . While a forbearing spirit may , and I trust will , be exercised toward the errors of our brethren in a particular quarter , duty to the rest of the Union demands that open and organized resistance to the laws should not be executed with impunity . The rich inheritance bequeathed by our fathers has devolved upon us the sacred obligation of preserving it by the same virtues which conducted them through the eventful scenes of the Revolution and ultimately crowned their struggle with the noblest model of civil institutions . They bequeathed to us a Government of laws and a Federal Union founded upon the great principle of popular representation . After a successful experiment of forty four years , at a moment when the Government and the Union are the objects of the hopes of the friends of civil liberty throughout the world , and in the midst of public and individual prosperity unexampled in history , we are called to decide whether these laws possess any force and that Union the means of self preservation . The decision of this question by an enlightened and patriotic people can not be doubtful . For myself , fellow citizens , devoutly relying upon that kind Providence which has hitherto watched over our destinies , and actuated by a profound reverence for those institutions I have so much cause to love , and for the American people , whose partiality honored me with their highest trust , I have determined to spare no effort to discharge the duty which in this conjuncture is devolved upon me . That a similar spirit will actuate the representatives of the American people is not to be questioned and I fervently pray that the Great Ruler of Nations may so guide your deliberations and our joint measures as that they may prove salutary examples not only to the present but to future times , and solemnly proclaim that the Constitution and the laws are supreme and the Union indissoluble .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States During the last session information was given to Congress by the Executive that measures had been taken to ascertain the political , military , and civil condition of Texas . I now submit for your consideration extracts from the report of the agent who had been appointed to collect it relative to the condition of that country . No steps have been taken by the Executive toward the acknowledgment of the independence of Texas , and the whole subject would have been left without further remark on the information now given to Congress were it not that the two Houses at their last session , acting separately , passed resolutions that the independence of Texas ought to be acknowledged by the United States whenever satisfactory information should be received that it had in successful operation a civil government capable of performing the duties and fulfilling the obligations of an independent power . This mark of interest in the question of the independence of Texas and indication of the views of Congress make it proper that I should somewhat in detail present the considerations that have governed the Executive in continuing to occupy the ground previously taken in the contest between Mexico and Texas . The acknowledgment of a new state as independent and entitled to a place in the family of nations is at all times an act of great delicacy and responsibility , but more especially so when such state has forcibly separated itself from another of which it had formed an integral part and which still claims dominion over it . A premature recognition under these circumstances , if not looked upon as justifiable cause of war , is always liable to be regarded as a proof of an unfriendly spirit to one of the contending parties . All questions relative to the government of foreign nations , whether of the Old or the New World , have been treated by the United States as questions of fact only , and our predecessors have cautiously abstained from deciding upon them until the clearest evidence was in their possession to enable them not only to decide correctly , but to shield their decisions from every unworthy imputation . In all the contests that have arisen out of the revolutions of France , out of the disputes relating to the crowns of Portugal and Spain , out of the revolutionary movements of those Kingdoms , out of the separation of the American possessions of both from the European Governments , and out of the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in Spanish America , so wisely consistent with our just principles has been the action of our Government that we have under the most critical circumstances avoided all censure and encountered no other evil than that produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide . It has thus been made known to the world that the uniform policy and practice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes which merely relate to the internal government of other nations , and eventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party , without reference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the original controversy . Public opinion here is so firmly established and well understood in favor of this policy that no serious disagreement has ever arisen among ourselves in relation to it , although brought under review in a variety of forms and at periods when the minds of the people were greatly excited by the agitation of topics purely domestic in their character . Nor has any deliberate inquiry ever been instituted in Congress or in any of our legislative bodies as to whom belonged the power of originally recognizing a new State a power the exercise of which is equivalent under some circumstances to a declaration of war a power nowhere expressly delegated , and only granted in the Constitution as it is necessarily involved in some of the great powers given to Congress , in that given to the President and Senate to form treaties with foreign powers and to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers , and in that conferred upon the President to receive ministers from foreign nations . In the preamble to the resolution of the House of Representatives it is distinctly intimated that the expediency of recognizing the independence of Texas should be left to the decision of Congress . In this view , on the ground of expediency , I am disposed to concur , and do not , therefore , consider it necessary to express any opinion as to the strict constitutional right of the Executive , either apart from or in conjunction with the Senate , over the subject . It is to be presumed that on no future occasion will a dispute arise , as none has heretofore occurred , between the Executive and Legislature in the exercise of the power of recognition . It will always be considered consistent with the spirit of the Constitution , and most safe , that it should be exercised , when probably leading to war , with a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declared , and by whom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must be furnished . Its submission to Congress , which represents in one of its branches the States of this Union and in the other the people of the United States , where there may be reasonable ground to apprehend so grave a consequence , would certainly afford the fullest satisfaction to our own country and a perfect guaranty to all other nations of the justice and prudence of the measures which might be adopted . In making these suggestions it is not my purpose to relieve myself from the responsibility of expressing my own opinions of the course the interests of our country prescribe and its honor permits us to follow . It is scarcely to be imagined that a question of this character could be presented in relation to which it would be more difficult for the United States to avoid exciting the suspicion and jealousy of other powers , and maintain their established character for fair and impartial dealing . But on this , as on every trying occasion , safety is to be found in a rigid adherence to principle . In the contest between Spain and her revolted colonies we stood aloof and waited , not only until the ability of the new States to protect themselves was fully established , but until the danger of their being again subjugated had entirely passed away . Then , and not till then , were they recognized . Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself . The same policy was observed in all the disputes growing out of the separation into distinct governments of those Spanish American States who began or carried on the contest with the parent country united under one form of government . We acknowledged the separate independence of New Granada , of Venezuela , and of Ecuador only after their independent existence was no longer a subject of dispute or was actually acquiesced in by those with whom they had been previously united . It is true that , with regard to Texas , the civil authority of Mexico has been expelled , its invading army defeated , the chief of the Republic himself captured , and all present power to control the newly organized Government of Texas annihilated within its confines . But , on the other hand , there is , in appearance at least , an immense disparity of physical force on the side of Mexico . The Mexican Republic under another executive is rallying its forces under a new leader and menacing a fresh invasion to recover its lost dominion . Upon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas may be considered as suspended , and were there nothing peculiar in the relative situation of the United States and Texas our acknowledgment of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as consistent with that prudent reserve with which we have heretofore held ourselves bound to treat all similar questions . But there are circumstances in the relations of the two countries which require us to act on this occasion with even more than our wonted caution . Texas was once claimed as a part of our property , and there are those among our citizens who , always reluctant to abandon that claim , can not but regard with solicitude the prospect of the reunion of the territory to this country . A large proportion of its civilized inhabitants are emigrants from the United States , speak the same language with ourselves , cherish the same principles , political and religious , and are bound to many of our citizens by ties of friendship and kindred blood and , more than all , it is known that the people of that country have instituted the same form of government with our own , and have since the close of your last session openly resolved , on the acknowledgment by us of their independence , to seek admission into the Union as one of the Federal States . This last circumstance is a matter of peculiar delicacy , and forces upon us considerations of the gravest character . The title of Texas to the territory she claims is identified with her independence . She asks us to acknowledge that title to the territory , with an avowed design to treat immediately of its transfer to the United States . It becomes us to beware of a too early movement , as it might subject us , however unjustly , to the imputation of seeking to establish the claim of our neighbors to a territory with a view to its subsequent acquisition by ourselves . Prudence , therefore , seems to dictate that we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude , if not until Mexico itself or one of the great foreign powers shall recognize the independence of the new Government , at least until the lapse of time or the course of events shall have proved beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the Government constituted by them . Neither of the contending parties can justly complain of this course . By pursuing it we are but carrying out the long established policy of our Government a policy which has secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence at home . Having thus discharged my duty , by presenting with simplicity and directness the views which after much reflection I have been led to take of this important subject , I have only to add the expression of my confidence that if Congress shall differ with me upon it their judgment will be the result of dispassionate , prudent , and wise deliberation , with the assurance that during the short time I shall continue connected with the Government I shall promptly and cordially unite with you in such measures as may be deemed best fitted to increase the prosperity and perpetuate the peace of our favored country .<speech_sep>To the Senate and House of Representatives Being more and more convinced that the destiny of the Indians within the settled portion of the United States depends upon their entire and speedy migration to the country west of the Mississippi set apart for their permanent residence , I am anxious that all the arrangements necessary to the complete execution of the plan of removal and to the ultimate security and improvement of the Indians should be made without further delay . Those who have already removed and are removing are sufficiently numerous to engage the serious attention of the Government , . and it is due not less to them than to the obligation which the nation has assumed that every reasonable step should be taken to fulfill the expectations that have been held out to them . Many of those who yet remain will no doubt within a short period become sensible that the course recommended is the only one which promises stability or improvement , and it is to be hoped that all of them will realize this truth and unite with their brethren beyond the Mississippi . Should they do so , there would then be no question of jurisdiction to prevent the Government from exercising such a general control over their affairs as may be essential to their interest and safety . Should any of them , however , repel the offer of removal , they are free to remain , but they must remain with such privileges and disabilities as the respective States within whose jurisdiction they live may prescribe . I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War , which presents a general outline of the progress that has already been made in this work and of all that remains to be done . It will be perceived that much information is yet necessary for the faithful performance of the duties of the Government , without which it will be impossible to provide for the execution of some of the existing stipulations , or make those prudential arrangements upon which the final success of the whole movement , so far as relates to the Indians themselves , must depend . I recommend the subject to the attention of Congress in the hope that the suggestions in this report may be found useful and that provision may be made for the appointment of the commissioners therein referred to and for vesting them with such authority as may be necessary to the satisfactory performance of the important duties proposed to be intrusted to them .<speech_sep>Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States passed on the 29th day of May , 1830 , it is provided that whenever the President of the United States shall receive satisfactory evidence that the Government of Great Britain will open the ports in its colonial possessions in the West Indies , on the continent of South America , the Bahama Islands , the Caicos , and the Bermuda or Somer Islands to the vessels of the United States for an indefinite or for a limited term that the vessels of the United States , and their cargoes , on entering the colonial ports aforesaid , shall not be subject to other or higher duties of tonnage or impost or charges of any other description than would be imposed on British vessels or their cargoes arriving in the said colonial possessions from the United States that the vessels of the United States may import into the said colonial possessions from the United States any article or articles which could be imported in a British vessel into the said possessions from the United States and that the vessels of the United States may export from the British colonies aforementioned , to any country whatever other than the dominions or possessions of Great Britain , any article or articles that can be exported therefrom in a British vessel to any country other than the British dominions or possessions as aforesaid , leaving the commercial intercourse of the United States with all other parts of the British dominions or possessions on a footing not less favorable to the United States than it now is that then , and in such case , the President of the United States shall be authorized , at any time before the next session of Congress , to issue his proclamation declaring that he has received such evidence , and that thereupon , and from the date of such proclamation , the ports of the United States shall be opened indefinitely or for a term fixed , as the case may be , to British vessels coming from the said British colonial possessions , and their cargoes , subject to no other or higher duty of tonnage or impost or charge of any description whatever than would be levied on the vessels of the United States or their cargoes arriving from the said British possessions and that it shall be lawful for the said British vessels to import into the United States and to export therefrom any article or articles which may be imported or exported in vessels of the United States and that the act entitled An act concerning navigation , passed on the 18th day of April , 1818 , an act supplementary thereto , passed the 15th day of May , 1820 , and an act entitled An act to regulate the commercial intercourse between the United States and certain British ports , passed on the 1st day of March , 1823 , shall in such case be suspended or absolutely repealed , as the case may require and Whereas by the said act it is further provided that whenever the ports of the United States shall have been opened under the authority thereby given , British vessels and their cargoes shall be admitted to an entry in the ports of the United States from the islands , provinces , or colonies of Great Britain on or near the North American continent and north or east of the United States and Whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by the President of the United States that whenever he shall give effect to the provisions of the act aforesaid the Government of Great Britain will open for an indefinite period the ports in its colonial possessions in the West Indies , on the continent of South America , the Bahama Islands , the Caicos , and the Bermuda or Somer Islands to the vessels of the United States , and their cargoes , upon the terms and according to the requisitions of the aforesaid act of Congress Now , therefore , Andrew Jackson , President of the United States of America , do hereby declare and proclaim that such evidence has been received by me , and that by the operation of the act of Congress passed on the 29th day of May , 1830 , the ports of the United States are from the date of this proclamation open to British vessels coming from the said British possessions , and their cargoes , upon the terms set forth in the said act . The act entitled An act concerning navigation , passed on the 18th day of April , 1818 , the act supplementary thereto , passed the 15th day of May , 1820 , and the act entitled An act to regulate the commercial intercourse between the United States and certain British ports , passed the 1st day of March , 1823 , are absolutely repealed , and British vessels and their cargoes are admitted to an entry in the ports of the United States from the islands , provinces , and colonies of Great Britain on or near the North American continent and north or east of the United States . Given under my hand , at the city of Washington , the 5th day of October , 1830 , and the fifty fifth of the Independence of the United States . ANDREW JACKSO<speech_sep>To the House of Representatives In addition to the general views I have heretofore expressed to Congress on the subject of internal improvement , it is my duty to advert to it again in stating my objections to the bill entitled An act for the improvement of certain harbors and the navigation of certain rivers , which was not received a sufficient time before the close of the last session to enable me to examine it before the adjournment . Having maturely considered that bill within the time allowed me by the Constitution , and being convinced that some of its provisions conflict with the rule adopted for my guide on this subject of legislation , I have been compelled to withhold from it my signature , and it has therefore failed to become a law . To facilitate as far as I can the intelligent action of Congress upon the subjects embraced in this bill , I transmit herewith a report from the Engineer Department , distinguishing , as far as the information within its possession would enable it , between those appropriations which do and those which do not conflict with the rules by which my conduct in this respect has hitherto been governed . By that report it will be seen that there is a class of appropriations in the bill for the improvement of streams that are not navigable , that are not channels of commerce , and that do not pertain to the harbors or ports of entry designated by law , or have any ascertained connection with the usual establishments for the security of commerce , external or internal . It is obvious that such appropriations involve the sanction of a principle that concedes to the General Government an unlimited power over the subject of internal improvements , and that I could not , therefore , approve a bill containing them without receding from the positions taken in my veto of the Maysville road bill , and afterwards in my annual message of December 6 , 1830 . It is to be regretted that the rules by which the classification of the improvements in this bill has been made by the Engineer Department are not more definite and certain , and that embarrassments may not always be avoided by the observance of them , but as neither my own reflection nor the lights derived from other sources have furnished me with a better guide , I shall continue to apply my best exertions to their application and enforcement . In thus employing my best faculties to exercise the power with which I am invested to avoid evils and to effect the greatest attainable good for our common country I feel that I may trust to your cordial cooperation , and the experience of the past leaves me no room to doubt the liberal indulgence and favorable consideration of those for whom we act . The grounds upon which I have given my assent to appropriations for the construction of lighthouses , beacons , buoys , public piers , and the removal of sand bars , sawyers , and other temporary or partial impediments in our navigable rivers and harbors , and with which many of the provisions of this bill correspond , have been so fully stated that I trust a repetition of them is unnecessary . Had there been incorporated in the bill no provisions for works of a different description , depending on principles which extend the power of making appropriations to every object which the discretion of the Government may select , and losing sight of the distinctions between national and local character which I had stated would be my future guide on the subject , I should have cheerfully signed the bill .<speech_sep>Fellow Citizens Being about to retire finally from public life , I beg leave to offer you my grateful thanks for the many proofs of kindness and confidence which I have received at your hands . It has been my fortune in the discharge of public duties , civil and military , frequently to have found myself in difficult and trying situations , where prompt decision and energetic action were necessary , and where the interest of the country required that high responsibilities should be fearlessly encountered and it is with the deepest emotions of gratitude that I acknowledge the continued and unbroken confidence with which you have sustained me in every trial . My public life has been a long one , and I can not hope that it has at all times been free from errors but I have the consolation of knowing that if mistakes have been committed they have not seriously injured the country I so anxiously endeavored to serve , and at the moment when I surrender my last public trust I leave this great people prosperous and happy , in the full enjoyment of liberty and peace , and honored and respected by every nation of the world . If my humble efforts have in any degree contributed to preserve to you these blessings , I have been more than rewarded by the honors you have heaped upon me , and , above all , by the generous confidence with which you have supported me in every peril , and with which you have continued to animate and cheer my path to the closing hour of my political life . The time has now come when advanced age and a broken frame warn me to retire from public concerns , but the recollection of the many favors you have bestowed upon me is engraven upon my heart , and I have felt that I could not part from your service without making this public acknowledgment of the gratitude I owe you . And if I use the occasion to offer to you the counsels of age and experience , you will , I trust , receive them with the same indulgent kindness which you have so often extended to me , and will at least see in them an earnest desire to perpetuate in this favored land the blessings of liberty and equal law . We have now lived almost fifty years under the Constitution framed by the sages and patriots of the Revolution . The conflicts in which the nations of Europe were engaged during a great part of this period , the spirit in which they waged war against each other , and our intimate commercial connections with every part of the civilized world rendered it a time of much difficulty for the Government of the United States . We have had our seasons of peace and of war , with all the evils which precede or follow a state of hostility with powerful nations . We encountered these trials with our Constitution yet in its infancy , and under the disadvantages which a new and untried government must always feel when it is called upon to put forth its whole strength without the lights of experience to guide it or the weight of precedents to justify its measures . But we have passed triumphantly through all these difficulties . Our Constitution is no longer a doubtful experiment , and at the end of nearly half a century we find that it has preserved unimpaired the liberties of the people , secured the rights of property , and that our country has improved and is flourishing beyond any former example in the history of nations . In our domestic concerns there is everything to encourage us , and if you are true to yourselves nothing can impede your march to the highest point of national prosperity . The States which had so long been retarded in their improvement by the Indian tribes residing in the midst of them are at length relieved from the evil , and this unhappy race the original dwellers in our land are now placed in a situation where we may well hope that they will share in the blessings of civilization and be saved from that degradation and destruction to which they were rapidly hastening while they remained in the States and while the safety and comfort of our own citizens have been greatly promoted by their removal , the philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that ill fated race has been at length placed beyond the reach of injury or oppression , and that the paternal care of the General Government will hereafter watch over them and protect them . If we turn to our relations with foreign powers , we find our condition equally gratifying . Actuated by the sincere desire to do justice to every nation and to preserve the blessings of peace , our intercourse with them has been conducted on the part of this Government in the spirit of frankness and I take pleasure in saying that it has generally been met in a corresponding temper . Difficulties of old standing have been surmounted by friendly discussion and the mutual desire to be just , and the claims of our citizens , which had been long withheld , have at length been acknowledged and adjusted and satisfactory arrangements made for their final payment and with a limited , and I trust a temporary , exception , our relations with every foreign power are now of the most friendly character , our commerce continually expanding , and our flag respected in every quarter of the world . These cheering and grateful prospects and these multiplied favors we owe , under Providence , to the adoption of the Federal Constitution . It is no longer a question whether this great country can remain happily united and flourish under our present form of government . Experience , the unerring test of all human undertakings , has shown the wisdom and foresight of those who formed it , and has proved that in the union of these States there is a sure foundation for the brightest hopes of freedom and for the happiness of the people . At every hazard and by every sacrifice this Union must be preserved . The necessity of watching with jealous anxiety for the preservation of the Union was earnestly pressed upon his fellow citizens by the Father of his Country in his Farewell Address . He has there told us that while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability , there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands and he has cautioned us in the strongest terms against the formation of parties on geographical discriminations , as one of the means which might disturb our Union and to which designing men would be likely to resort . The lessons contained in this invaluable legacy of Washington to his countrymen should be cherished in the heart of every citizen to the latest generation and perhaps at no period of time could they be more usefully remembered than at the present moment for when we look upon the scenes that are passing around us and dwell upon the pages of his parting address , his paternal counsels would seem to be not merely the offspring of wisdom and foresight , but the voice of prophecy , foretelling events and warning us of the evil to come . Forty years have passed since this imperishable document was given to his countrymen . The Federal Constitution was then regarded by him as an experiment and he so speaks of it in his Address but an experiment upon the success of which the best hopes of his country depended and we all know that he was prepared to lay down his life , if necessary , to secure to it a full and a fair trial . The trial has been made . It has succeeded beyond the proudest hopes of those who framed it . Every quarter of this widely extended nation has felt its blessings and shared in the general prosperity produced by its adoption . But amid this general prosperity and splendid success the dangers of which he warned us are becoming every day more evident , and the signs of evil are sufficiently apparent to awaken the deepest anxiety in the bosom of the patriot . We behold systematic efforts publicly made to sow the seeds of discord between different parts of the United States and to place party divisions directly upon geographical distinctions to excite the South against the North and the North against the South , and to force into the controversy the most delicate and exciting topics topics upon which it is impossible that a large portion of the Union can ever speak without strong emotion . Appeals , too , are constantly made to sectional interests in order to influence the election of the Chief Magistrate , as if it were desired that he should favor a particular quarter of the country instead of fulfilling the duties of his station with impartial justice to all and the possible dissolution of the Union has at length become an ordinary and familiar subject of discussion . Has the warning voice of Washington been forgotten , or have designs already been formed to sever the Union Let it not be supposed that I impute to all of those who have taken an active part in these unwise and unprofitable discussions a want of patriotism or of public virtue . The honorable feeling of State pride and local attachments finds a place in the bosoms of the most enlightened and pure . But while such men are conscious of their own integrity and honesty of purpose , they ought never to forget that the citizens of other States are their political brethren , and that however mistaken they may be in their views , the great body of them are equally honest and upright with themselves . Mutual suspicions and reproaches may in time create mutual hostility , and artful and designing men will always be found who are ready to foment these fatal divisions and to inflame the natural jealousies of different sections of the country . The history of the world is full of such examples , and especially the history of republics . What have you to gain by division and dissension Delude not yourselves with the belief that a breach once made may be afterwards repaired . If the Union is once severed , the line of separation will grow wider and wider , and the controversies which are now debated and settled in the halls of legislation will then be tried in fields of battle and determined by the sword . Neither should you deceive yourselves with the hope that the first line of separation would be the permanent one , and that nothing but harmony and concord would be found in the new associations formed upon the dissolution of this Union . Local interests would still be found there , and unchastened ambition . And if the recollection of common dangers , in which the people of these United States stood side by side against the common foe , the memory of victories won by their united valor , the prosperity and happiness they have enjoyed under the present Constitution , the proud name they bear as citizens of this great Republic if all these recollections and proofs of common interest are not strong enough to bind us together as one people , what tie will hold united the new divisions of empire when these bonds have been broken and this Union dissevered The first line of separation would not last for a single generation new fragments would be torn off , new leaders would spring up , and this great and glorious Republic would soon be broken into a multitude of petty States , without commerce , without credit , jealous of one another , armed for mutual aggression , loaded with taxes to pay armies and leaders , seeking aid against each other from foreign powers , insulted and trampled upon by the nations of Europe , until , harassed with conflicts and humbled and debased in spirit , they would be ready to submit to the absolute dominion of any military adventurer and to surrender their liberty for the sake of repose . It is impossible to look on the consequences that would inevitably follow the destruction of this Government and not feel indignant when we hear cold calculations about the value of the Union and have so constantly before us a line of conduct so well calculated to weaken its ties . There is too much at stake to allow pride or passion to influence your decision . Never for a moment believe that the great body of the citizens of any State or States can deliberately intend to do wrong . They may , under the influence of temporary excitement or misguided opinions , commit mistakes they may be misled for a time by the suggestions of self interest but in a community so enlightened and patriotic as the people of the United States argument will soon make them sensible of their errors , and when convinced they will be ready to repair them . If they have no higher or better motives to govern them , they will at least perceive that their own interest requires them to be just to others , as they hope to receive justice at their hands . But in order to maintain the Union unimpaired it is absolutely necessary that the laws passed by the constituted authorities should be faithfully executed in every part of the country , and that every good citizen should at all times stand ready to put down , with the combined force of the nation , every attempt at unlawful resistance , under whatever pretext it may be made or whatever shape it may assume . Unconstitutional or oppressive laws may no doubt be passed by Congress , either from erroneous views or the want of due consideration if they are within the reach of judicial authority , the remedy is easy and peaceful and if , from the character of the law , it is an abuse of power not within the control of the judiciary , then free discussion and calm appeals to reason and to the justice of the people will not fail to redress the wrong . But until the law shall be declared void by the courts or repealed by Congress no individual or combination of individuals can be justified in forcibly resisting its execution . It is impossible that any government can continue to exist upon any other principles . It would cease to be a government and be unworthy of the name if it had not the power to enforce the execution of its own laws within its own sphere of action . It is true that cases may be imagined disclosing such a settled purpose of usurpation and oppression on the part of the Government as would justify an appeal to arms . These , however , are extreme cases , which we have no reason to apprehend in a government where the power is in the hands of a patriotic people . And no citizen who loves his country would in any case whatever resort to forcible resistance unless he clearly saw that the time had come when a freeman should prefer death to submission for if such a struggle is once begun , and the citizens of one section of the country arrayed in arms against those of another in doubtful conflict , let the battle result as it may , there will be an end of the Union and with it an end to the hopes of freedom . The victory of the injured would not secure to them the blessings of liberty it would avenge their wrongs , but they would themselves share in the common ruin . But the Constitution can not be maintained nor the Union preserved , in opposition to public feeling , by the mere exertion of the coercive powers confided to the General Government . The foundations must be laid in the affections of the people , in the security it gives to life , liberty , character , and property in every quarter of the country , and in the fraternal attachment which the citizens of the several States bear to one another as members of one political family , mutually contributing to promote the happiness of each other . Hence the citizens of every State should studiously avoid everything calculated to wound the sensibility or offend the just pride of the people of other States , and they should frown upon any proceedings within their own borders likely to disturb the tranquillity of their political brethren in other portions of the Union . In a country so extensive as the United States , and with pursuits so varied , the internal regulations of the several States must frequently differ from one another in important particulars , and this difference is unavoidably increased by the varying principles upon which the American colonies were originally planted principles which had taken deep root in their social relations before the Revolution , and therefore of necessity influencing their policy since they became free and independent States . But each State has the unquestionable right to regulate its own internal concerns according to its own pleasure , and while it does not interfere with the rights of the people of other States or the rights of the Union , every State must be the sole judge of the measures proper to secure the safety of its citizens and promote their happiness and all efforts on the part of people of other States to cast odium upon their institutions , and all measures calculated to disturb their rights of property or to put in jeopardy their peace and internal tranquillity , are in direct opposition to the spirit in which the Union was formed , and must endanger its safety . Motives of philanthropy may be assigned for this unwarrantable interference , and weak men may persuade themselves for a moment that they are laboring in the cause of humanity and asserting the rights of the human race but everyone , upon sober reflection , will see that nothing but mischief can come from these improper assaults upon the feelings and rights of others . Rest assured that the men found busy in this work of discord are not worthy of your confidence , and deserve your strongest reprobation . In the legislation of Congress also , and in every measure of the General Government , justice to every portion of the United States should be faithfully observed . No free government can stand without virtue in the people and a lofty spirit of patriotism , and if the sordid feelings of mere selfishness shall usurp the place which ought to be filled by public spirit , the legislation of Congress will soon be converted into a scramble for personal and sectional advantages . Under our free institutions the citizens of every quarter of our country are capable of attaining a high degree of prosperity and happiness without seeking to profit themselves at the expense of others and every such attempt must in the end fail to succeed , for the people in every part of the United States are too enlightened not to understand their own rights and interests and to detect and defeat every effort to gain undue advantages over them and when such designs are discovered it naturally provokes resentments which can not always be easily allayed . Justice full and ample justice to every portion of the United States should be the ruling principle of every freeman , and should guide the deliberations of every public body , whether it be State or national . It is well known that there have always been those amongst us who wish to enlarge the powers of the . General Government , and experience would seem to indicate that there is a tendency on the part of this Government to overstep the boundaries marked out for it by the Constitution . Its legitimate authority is abundantly sufficient for all the purposes for which it was created , and its powers being expressly enumerated , there can be no justification for claiming anything beyond them . Every attempt to exercise power beyond these limits should be promptly and firmly opposed , for one evil example will lead to other measures still more mischievous and if the principle of constructive powers or supposed advantages or temporary circumstances shall ever be permitted to justify the assumption of a power not given by the Constitution , the General Government will before long absorb all the powers of legislation , and you will have in effect but one consolidated government . From the extent of our country , its diversified interests , different pursuits , and different habits , it is too obvious for argument that a single consolidated government would be wholly inadequate to watch over and protect its interests and every friend of our free institutions should be always prepared to maintain unimpaired and in full vigor the rights and sovereignty of the States and to confine the action of the General Government strictly to the sphere of its appropriate duties . There is , perhaps , no one of the powers conferred on the Federal Government so liable to abuse as the taxing power . The most productive and convenient sources of revenue were necessarily given to it , that it might be able to perform the important duties imposed upon it and the taxes which it lays upon commerce being concealed from the real payer in the price of the article , they do not so readily attract the attention of the people as smaller sums demanded from them directly by the taxgatherer . But the tax imposed on goods enhances by so much the price of the commodity to the consumer , and as many of these duties are imposed on articles of necessity which are daily used by the great body of the people , the money raised by these imposts is drawn from their pockets . Congress has no right under the Constitution to take money from the people unless it is required to execute some one of the specific powers intrusted to the Government and if they raise more than is necessary for such purposes , it is an abuse of the power of taxation , and unjust and oppressive . It may indeed happen that the revenue will sometimes exceed the amount anticipated when the taxes were laid . When , however , this is ascertained , it is easy to reduce them , and in such a case it is unquestionably the duty of the Government to reduce them , for no circumstances can justify it in assuming a power not given to it by the Constitution nor in taking away the money of the people when it is not needed for the legitimate wants of the Government . Plain as these principles appear to be , you will yet find there is a constant effort to induce the General Government to go beyond the limits of its taxing power and to impose unnecessary burdens upon the people . Many powerful interests are continually at work to procure heavy duties on commerce and to swell the revenue beyond the real necessities of the public service , and the country has already felt the injurious effects of their combined influence . They succeeded in obtaining a tariff of duties bearing most oppressively on the agricultural and laboring classes of society and producing a revenue that could not be usefully employed within the range of the powers conferred upon Congress , and in order to fasten upon the people this unjust and unequal system of taxation extravagant schemes of internal improvement were got up in various quarters to squander the money and to purchase support . Thus one unconstitutional measure was intended to be upheld by another , and the abuse of the power of taxation was to be maintained by usurping the power of expending the money in internal improvements . You can not have forgotten the severe and doubtful struggle through which we passed when the executive department of the Government by its veto endeavored to arrest this prodigal scheme of injustice and to bring back the legislation of Congress to the boundaries prescribed by the Constitution . The good sense and practical judgment of the people when the subject was brought before them sustained the course of the Executive , and this plan of unconstitutional expenditures for the purposes of corrupt influence is , I trust , finally overthrown . The result of this decision has been felt in the rapid extinguishment of the public debt and the large accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury , notwithstanding the tariff was reduced and is now very far below the amount originally contemplated by its advocates . But , rely upon it , the design to collect an extravagant revenue and to burden you with taxes beyond the economical wants of the Government is not yet abandoned . The various interests which have combined together to impose a heavy tariff and to produce an overflowing Treasury are too strong and have too much at stake to surrender the contest . The corporations and wealthy individuals who are engaged in large manufacturing establishments desire a high tariff to increase their gains . Designing politicians will support it to conciliate their favor and to obtain the means of profuse expenditure for the purpose of purchasing influence in other quarters and since the people have decided that the Federal Government can not be permitted to employ its income in internal improvements , efforts will be made to seduce and mislead the citizens of the several States by holding out to them the deceitful prospect of benefits to be derived from a surplus revenue collected by the General Government and annually divided among the States and if , encouraged by these fallacious hopes , the States should disregard the principles of economy which ought to characterize every republican government , and should indulge in lavish expenditures exceeding their resources , they will before long find themselves oppressed with debts which they are unable to pay , and the temptation will become irresistible to support a high tariff in order to obtain a surplus for distribution . Do not allow yourselves , my fellow citizens , to be misled on this subject . The Federal Government can not collect a surplus for such purposes without violating the principles of the Constitution and assuming powers which have not been granted . It is , moreover , a system of injustice , and if persisted in will inevitably lead to corruption , and must end in ruin . The surplus revenue will be drawn from the pockets of the people from the farmer , the mechanic , and the laboring classes of society but who will receive it when distributed among the States , where it is to be disposed of by leading State politicians , who have friends to favor and political partisans to gratify It will certainly not be returned to those who paid it and who have most need of it and are honestly entitled to it . There is but one safe rule , and that is to confine the General Government rigidly within the sphere of its appropriate duties . It has no power to raise a revenue or impose taxes except for the purposes enumerated in the Constitution , and if its income is found to exceed these wants it should be forthwith reduced and the burden of the people so far lightened . In reviewing the conflicts which have taken place between different interests in the United States and the policy pursued since the adoption of our present form of Government , we find nothing that has produced such deep seated evil as the course of legislation in relation to the currency . The Constitution of the United States unquestionably intended to secure to the people a circulating medium of gold and silver . But the establishment of a national bank by Congress , with the privilege of issuing paper money receivable in the payment of the public dues , and the unfortunate course of legislation in the several States upon the same subject , drove from general circulation the constitutional currency and substituted one of paper in its place . It was not easy for men engaged in the ordinary pursuits of business , whose attention had not been particularly drawn to the subject , to foresee all the consequences of a currency exclusively of paper , and we ought not on that account to be surprised at the facility with which laws were obtained to carry into effect the paper system . Honest and even enlightened men are sometimes misled by the specious and plausible statements of the designing . But experience has now proved the mischiefs and dangers of a paper currency , and it rests with you to determine whether the proper remedy shall be applied . The paper system being founded on public confidence and having of itself no intrinsic value , it is liable to great and sudden fluctuations , thereby rendering property insecure and the wages of labor unsteady and uncertain . The corporations which create the paper money can not be relied upon to keep the circulating medium uniform in amount . In times of prosperity , when confidence is high , they are tempted by the prospect of gain or by the influence of those who hope to profit by it to extend their issues of paper beyond the bounds of discretion and the reasonable demands of business and when these issues have been pushed on from day to day , until public confidence is at length shaken , then a reaction takes place , and they immediately withdraw the credits they have given , suddenly curtail their issues , and produce an unexpected and ruinous contraction of the circulating medium , which is felt by the whole community . The banks by this means save themselves , and the mischievous consequences of their imprudence or cupidity are visited upon the public . Nor does the evil stop here . These ebbs and flows in the currency and these indiscreet extensions of credit naturally engender a spirit of speculation injurious to the habits and character of the people . We have already seen its effects in the wild spirit of speculation in the public lands and various kinds of stock which within the last year or two seized upon such a multitude of our citizens and threatened to pervade all classes of society and to withdraw their attention from the sober pursuits of honest industry . It is not by encouraging this spirit that we shall best preserve public virtue and promote the true interests of our country but if your currency continues as exclusively paper as it now is , it will foster this eager desire to amass wealth without labor it will multiply the number of dependents on bank accommodations and bank favors the temptation to obtain money at any sacrifice will become stronger and stronger , and inevitably lead to corruption , which will find its way into your public councils and destroy at no distant day the purity of your Government . Some of the evils which arise from this system of paper press with peculiar hardship upon the class of society least able to bear it . A portion of this currency frequently becamedepreciated or worthless , and all of it is easily counterfeited in such a manner as to require peculiar skill and much experience to distinguish the counterfeit from the genuine note . These frauds are most generally perpetrated in the smaller notes , which are used in the daily transactions of ordinary business , and the losses occasioned by them are commonly thrown upon the laboring classes of society , whose situation and pursuits put it out of their power to guard themselves from these impositions , and whose daily wages are necessary for their subsistence . It is the duty of every government so to regulate its currency as to protect this numerous class , as far as practicable , from the impositions of avarice and fraud . It is more especially the duty of the United States , where the Government is emphatically the Government of the people , and where this respectable portion of our citizens are so proudly distinguished from the laboring classes of all other nations by their independent spirit , their love of liberty , their intelligence , and their high tone of moral character . Their industry in peace is the source of our wealth and their bravery in war has covered us with glory and the Government of the United States will but ill discharge its duties if it leaves them a prey to such dishonest impositions . Yet it is evident that their interests can not be effectually protected unless silver and gold are restored to circulation . These views alone of the paper currency are sufficient to call for immediate reform but there is another consideration which should still more strongly press it upon your attention . Recent events have proved that the paper money system of this country may be used as an engine to undermine your free institutions , and that those who desire to engross all power in the hands of the few and to govern by corruption or force are aware of its power and prepared to employ it . Your banks now furnish your only circulating medium , and money is plenty or scarce according to the quantity of notes issued by them . While they have capitals not greatly disproportioned to each other , they are competitors in business , and no one of them can exercise dominion over the rest and although in the present state of the currency these banks may and do operate injuriously upon the habits of business , the pecuniary concerns , and the moral tone of society , yet , from their number and dispersed situation , they can not combine for the purposes of political influence , and whatever may be the dispositions of some of them their power of mischief must necessarily be confined to a narrow space and felt only in their immediate neighborhoods . But when the charter for the Bank of the United States was obtained from Congress it perfected the schemes of the paper system and gave to its advocates the position they have struggled to obtain from the commencement of the Federal Government to the present hour . The immense capital and peculiar privileges bestowed upon it enabled it to exercise despotic sway over the other banks in every part of the country . From its superior strength it could seriously injure , if not destroy , the business of any one of them which might incur its resentment and it openly claimed for itself the power of regulating the currency throughout the United States . In other words , it asserted and it undoubtedly possessed the power to make money plenty or scarce at its pleasure , at any time and in any quarter of the Union , by controlling the issues of other banks and permitting an expansion or compelling a general contraction of the circulating medium , according to its own will . The other banking institutions were sensible of its strength , and they soon generally became its obedient instruments , ready at all times to execute its mandates and with the banks necessarily went also that numerous class of persons in our commercial cities who depend altogether on bank credits for their solvency and means of business , and who are therefore obliged , for their own safety , to propitiate the favor of the money power by distinguished zeal and devotion in its service . The result of the ill advised legislation which established this great monopoly was to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the Union , with its boundless means of corruption and its numerous dependents , under the direction and command of one acknowledged head , thus organizing this particular interest as one body and securing to it unity and concert of action throughout the United States , and enabling it to bring forward upon any occasion its entire and undivided strength to support or defeat any measure of the Government . In the hands of this formidable power , thus perfectly organized , was also placed unlimited dominion over the amount of the circulating medium , giving it the power to regulate the value of property and the fruits of labor in every quarter of the Union , and to bestow prosperity or bring ruin upon any city or section of the country as might best comport with its own interest or policy . We are not left to conjecture how the moneyed power , thus organized and with such a weapon in its hands , would be likely to use it . The distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country when the Bank of the United States waged war upon the people in order to compel them to submit to its demands can not yet be forgotten . The ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole cities and communities were oppressed , individuals impoverished and ruined , and a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the United States . If such was its power in a time of peace , what would it not have been in a season of war , with an enemy at your doors No nation but the freemen of the United States could have come out victorious from such a contest yet , if you had not conquered , the Government would have passed from the hands of the many to the hands of the few , and this organized money power from its secret conclave would have dictated the choice of your highest officers and compelled you to make peace or war , as best suited their own wishes . The forms of your Government might for a time have remained , but its living spirit would have departed from it . The distress and sufferings inflicted on the people by the bank are some of the fruits of that system of policy which is continually striving to enlarge the authority of the Federal Government beyond the limits fixed by the Constitution . The powers enumerated in that instrument do not confer on Congress the right to establish such a corporation as the Bank of the United States , and the evil consequences which followed may warn us of the danger of departing from the true rule of construction and of permitting temporary circumstances or the hope of better promoting the public welfare to influence in any degree our decisions upon the extent of the authority of the General Government . Let us abide by the Constitution as it is written , or amend it in the constitutional mode if it is found to be defective . The severe lessons of experience will , I doubt not , be sufficient to prevent Congress from again chartering such a monopoly , even if the Constitution did not present an insuperable objection to it . But you must remember , my fellow citizens , that eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty , and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing . It behooves you , therefore , to be watchful in your States as well as in the Federal Government . The power which the moneyed interest can exercise , when concentrated under a single head and with our present system of currency , was sufficiently demonstrated in the struggle made by the Bank of the United States . Defeated in the General Government , tho same class of intriguers and politicians will now resort to the States and endeavor to obtain there the same organization which they failed to perpetuate in the Union and with specious and deceitful plans of public advantages and State interests and State pride they will endeavor to establish in the different States one moneyed institution with overgrown capital and exclusive privileges sufficient to enable it to control the operations of the other banks . Such an institution will be pregnant with the same evils produced by the Bank of the United States , although its sphere of action is more confined , and in the State in which it is chartered the money power will be able to embody its whole strength and to move together with undivided force to accomplish any object it may wish to attain . You have already had abundant evidence of its power to inflict injury upon the agricultural , mechanical , and laboring classes of society , and over those whose engagements in trade or speculation render them dependent on bank facilities the dominion of the State monopoly will be absolute and their obedience unlimited . With such a bank and a paper currency the money power would in a few years govern the State and control its measures , and if a sufficient number of States can be induced to create such establishments the time will soon come when it will again take the field against the United States and succeed in perfecting and perpetuating its organization by a charter from Congress . It is one of the serious evils of our present system of banking that it enables one class of society and that by no means a numerous one by its control over the currency , to act injuriously upon the interests of all the others and to exercise more than its just proportion of influence in political affairs . The agricultural , the mechanical , and the laboring classes have little or no share in the direction of the great moneyed corporations , and from their habits and the nature of their pursuits they are incapable of forming extensive combinations to act together with united force . Such concert of action may sometimes be produced in a single city or in a small district of country by means of personal communications with each other , but they have no regular or active correspondence with those who are engaged in similar pursuits in distant places they have but little patronage to give to the press , and exercise but a small share of influence over it they have no crowd of dependents about them who hope to grow rich without labor by their countenance and favor , and who are therefore always ready to execute their wishes . The planter , the farmer , the mechanic , and the laborer all know that their success depends upon their own industry and economy , and that they must not expect to become suddenly rich by the fruits of their toil . Yet these classes of society form the great body of the people of the United States they are the bone and sinew of the country men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws , and who , moreover , hold the great mass of our national wealth , although it is distributed in moderate amounts among the millions of freemen who possess it . But with overwhelming numbers and wealth on their side they are in constant danger of losing their fair influence in the Government , and with difficulty maintain their just rights against the incessant efforts daily made to encroach upon them . The mischief springs from the power which the moneyed interest derives from a paper currency which they are able to control , from the multitude of corporations with exclusive privileges which they have succeeded in obtaining in the different States , and which are employed altogether for their benefit and unless you become more watchful in your States and check this spirit of monopoly and thirst for exclusive privileges you will in the end find that the most important powers of Government have been given or bartered away , and the control over your dearest interests has passed into the hands of these corporations . The paper money system and its natural associations monopoly and exclusive privileges have already struck their roots too deep in the soil , and it will require all your efforts to check its further growth and to eradicate the evil . The men who profit by the abuses and desire to perpetuate them will continue to besiege the halls of legislation in the General Government as well as in the States , and will seek by every artifice to mislead and deceive the public servants . It is to yourselves that you must look for safety and the means of guarding and perpetuating your free institutions . In your hands is rightfully placed the sovereignty of the country , and to you everyone placed in authority is ultimately responsible . It is always in your power to see that the wishes of the people are carried into faithful execution , and their will , when once made known , must sooner or later be obeyed and while the people remain , as I trust they ever will , uncorrupted and incorruptible , and continue watchful and jealous of their rights , the Government is safe , and the cause of freedom will continue to triumph over all its enemies . But it will require steady and persevering exertions on your part to rid yourselves of the iniquities and mischiefs of the paper system and to check the spirit of monopoly and other abuses which have sprung up with it , and of which it is the main support . So many interests are united to resist all reform on this subject that you must not hope the conflict will be a short one nor success easy . My humble efforts have not been spared during my administration of the Government to restore the constitutional currency of gold and silver , and something , I trust , has been done toward the accomplishment of this most desirable object but enough yet remains to require all your energy and perseverance . The power , however , is in your hands , and the remedy must and will be applied if you determine upon it . While I am thus endeavoring to press upon your attention the principles which I deem of vital importance in the domestic concerns of the country , I ought not to pass over without notice the important considerations which should govern your policy toward foreign powers . It is unquestionably our true interest to cultivate the most friendly understanding with every nation and to avoid by every honorable means the calamities of war , and we shall best attain this object by frankness and sincerity in our foreign intercourse , by the prompt and faithful execution of treaties , and by justice and impartiality in our conduct to all . But no nation , however desirous of peace , can hope to escape occasional collisions with other powers , and the soundest dictates of policy require that we should place ourselves in a condition to assert our rights if a resort to force should ever become necessary . Our local situation , our long line of seacoast , indented by numerous bays , with deep rivers opening into the interior , as well as our extended and still increasing commerce , point to the Navy as our natural means of defense . It will in the end be found to be the cheapest and most effectual , and now is the time , in a season of peace and with an overflowing revenue , that we can year after year add to its strength without increasing the burdens of the people . It is your true policy , for your Navy will not only protect your rich and flourishing commerce in distant seas , but will enable you to reach and annoy the enemy and will give to defense its greatest efficiency by meeting danger at a distance from home . It is impossible by any line of fortifications to guard every point from attack against a hostile force advancing from the ocean and selecting its object , but they are indispensable to protect cities from bombardment , dockyards and naval arsenals from destruction , to give shelter to merchant vessels in time of war and to single ships or weaker squadrons when pressed by superior force . Fortifications of this description can not be too soon completed and armed and placed in a condition of the most perfect preparation . The abundant means we now possess can not be applied in any manner more useful to the country , and when this is done and our naval force sufficiently strengthened and our militia armed we need not fear that any nation will wantonly insult us or needlessly provoke hostilities . We shall more certainly preserve peace when it is well understood that we are prepared for War . In presenting to you , my fellow citizens , these parting counsels , I have brought before you the leading principles upon which I endeavored to administer the Government in the high office with which you twice honored me . Knowing that the path of freedom is continually beset by enemies who often assume the disguise of friends , I have devoted the last hours of my public life to warn you of the dangers . The progress of the United States under our free and happy institutions has surpassed the most sanguine hopes of the founders of the Republic . Our growth has been rapid beyond all former example in numbers , in wealth , in knowledge , and all the useful arts which contribute to the comforts and convenience of man , and from the earliest ages of history to the present day there never have been thirteen millions of people associated in one political body who enjoyed so much freedom and happiness as the people of these United States . You have no longer any cause to fear danger from abroad your strength and power are well known throughout the civilized world , as well as the high and gallant bearing of your sons . It is from within , among yourselves from cupidity , from corruption , from disappointed ambition and inordinate thirst for power that factions will be formed and liberty endangered . It is against such designs , whatever disguise the actors may assume , that you have especially to guard yourselves . You have the highest of human trusts committed to your care . Providence has showered on this favored land blessings without number , and has chosen you as the guardians of freedom , to preserve it for the benefit of the human race . May He who holds in His hands the destinies of nations make you worthy of the favors He has bestowed and enable you , with pure hearts and pure hands and sleepless vigilance , to guard and defend to the end of time the great charge He has committed to your keeping . My own race is nearly run advanced age and failing health warn me that before long I must pass beyond the reach of human events and cease to feet the vicissitudes of human affairs . I thank God that my life has been spent in a land of liberty and that He has given me a heart to love my country with the affection of a son . And filled with gratitude for your constant and unwavering kindness , I bid you a last and affectionate farewell .<speech_sep>By Andrew Jackson , President of the United States Whereas a convention assembled in the State of South Carolina have passed an ordinance by which they declare that the several acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the United States purporting to be laws for the imposing of duties and imposts on the importation of foreign commodities , and now having actual operation and effect within the United States , and more especially two acts for the same purposes passed on the 29th of May , 1828 , and on the 14th of July , 1832 , are unauthorized by the Constitution of the United States , and violate the true meaning and intent thereof , and are null and void and no law , nor binding on the citizens of that State or its officers and by the said ordinance it is further declared to be unlawful for any of the constituted authorities of the State or of the United States to enforce the payment of the duties imposed by the said acts within the same State , and that it is the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as may be necessary to give full effect to the said ordinance and Whereas by the said ordinance it is further ordained that in no case of law or equity decided in the courts of said State wherein shall be drawn in question the validity of the said ordinance , or of the acts of the legislature that may be passed to give it effect , or of the said laws of the United States , no appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States , nor shall any copy of the record be permitted or allowed for that purpose , and that any person attempting to take such appeal shall be punished as for contempt of court and , finally , the said ordinance declares that the people of South Carolina will maintain the said ordinance at every hazard , and that they will consider the passage of any act by Congress abolishing or closing the ports of the said State or otherwise obstructing the free ingress or egress of vessels to and from the said ports , or any other act of the Federal Government to coerce the State , shut up her ports , destroy or harass her commerce , or to enforce the said acts otherwise than through the civil tribunals of the country , as inconsistent with the longer continuance of South Carolina in the Union , and that the people of the said State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the other States , and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which sovereign and independent states may of right do and Whereas the said ordinance prescribes to the people of South Carolina a course of conduct in direct violation of their duty as citizens of the United States , contrary to the laws of their country , subversive of its Constitution , and having for its object the destruction of the Union that Union which , coeval with our political existence , led our fathers , without any other ties to unite them than those of patriotism and a common cause , through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence that sacred Union , hitherto inviolate , which , perfected by our happy Constitution , has brought us , by the favor of Heaven , to a state of prosperity at home and high consideration abroad rarely , if ever , equaled in the history of nations To preserve this bond of our political existence from destruction , to maintain inviolate this state of national honor and prosperity , and to justify the confidence my fellow citizens have reposed in me , Andrew Jackson , President of the United States , have thought proper to issue this my proclamation , stating my views of the Constitution and laws applicable to the measures adopted by the convention of South Carolina and to the reasons they have put forth to sustain them , declaring the course which duty will require me to pursue , and , appealing to the understanding and patriotism of the people , warn them of the consequences that must inevitably result from an observance of the dictates of the convention . Strict duty would require of me nothing more than the exercise of those powers with which I am now or may hereafter be invested for preserving the peace of the Union and for the execution of the laws but the imposing aspect which opposition has assumed in this case , by clothing itself with State authority , and the deep interest which the people of the United States must all feel in preventing a resort to stronger measures while there is a hope that anything will be yielded to reasoning and remonstrance , perhaps demand , and will certainly justify , a full exposition to South Carolina and the nation of the views I entertain of this important question , as well as a distinct enunciation of the course which my sense of duty will require me to pursue . The ordinance is founded , not on the indefensible right of resisting acts which are plainly unconstitutional and too oppressive to be endured , but on the strange position that any one State may not only declare an act of Congress void , but prohibit its execution that they may do this consistently with the Constitution that the true construction of that instrument permits a State to retain its place in the Union and yet be bound by no other of its laws than those it may choose to consider as constitutional . It is true , they add , that to justify this abrogation of a law it must be palpably contrary to the Constitution but it is evident that to give the right of resisting laws of that description , coupled with the uncontrolled right to decide what laws deserve that character , is to give the power of resisting all laws for as by the theory there is no appeal , the reasons alleged by the State , good or bad , must prevail . If it should be said that public opinion is a sufficient check against the abuse of this power , it may be asked why it is not deemed a sufficient guard against the passage of an unconstitutional act by Congress There is , however , a restraint in this last case which makes the assumed power of a State more indefensible , and which does not exist in the other . There are two appeals from an unconstitutional act passed by Congress one to the judiciary , the other to the people and the States . There is no appeal from the State decision in theory , and the practical illustration shows that the courts are closed against an application to review it , both judges and jurors being sworn to decide in its favor . But reasoning on this subject is superfluous when our social compact , in express terms , declares that the laws of the United States , its Constitution , and treaties made under it are the supreme law of the land , and , for greater caution , adds that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . And it may be asserted without fear of refutation that no federative government could exist without a similar provision . Look for a moment to the consequence . If South Carolina considers the revenue laws unconstitutional and has a right to prevent their execution in the port of Charleston , there would be a clear constitutional objection to their collection in every other port and no revenue could be collected anywhere , for all imposts must be equal . It is no answer to repeat that an unconstitutional law is no law so long as the question of its legality is to be decided by the State itself , for every law operating injuriously upon any local interest will be perhaps thought , and certainly represented , as unconstitutional , and , as has been shown , there is no appeal . If this doctrine had been established at an earlier day . , the Union would have been dissolved in its infancy . The excise law in Pennsylvania , the embargo and nonintercourse law in the Eastern States , the carriage tax in Virginia , were all deemed unconstitutional , and were more unequal in their operation than any of the laws now complained of but , fortunately , none of those States discovered that they had the right now claimed by South Carolina . The war into which we were forced to support the dignity of the nation and the rights of our citizens might have ended in defeat and disgrace , instead of victory and honor , if the States who supposed it a ruinous and unconstitutional measure had thought they possessed the right of nullifying the act by which it was declared and denying supplies for its prosecution . Hardly and unequally as those measures bore upon several members of the Union , to the legislatures of none did this efficient and peaceable remedy , as it is called , suggest itself . The discovery of this important feature in our Constitution was reserved to the present day . To the statesmen of South Carolina belongs the invention , and upon the citizens of that State will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to practice . If the doctrine of a State veto upon the laws of the Union carries with it internal evidence of its impracticable absurdity , our constitutional history will also afford abundant proof that it would have been repudiated with indignation had it been proposed to form a feature in our Government . In our colonial state , although dependent on another power , we very early considered ourselves as connected by common interest with each other . Leagues were formed for common defense , and before the declaration of independence we were known in our aggregate character as the United Colonies of America . That decisive and important step was taken jointly . We declared ourselves a nation by a joint , not by several acts , and when the terms of our Confederation were reduced to form it was in that of a solemn league of several States , by which they agreed that they would collectively form one nation for the purpose of conducting some certain domestic concerns and all foreign relations . In the instrument forming that Union is found an article which declares that every State shall abide by the determinations of Congress on all questions which by that Confederation should be submitted to them . Under the Confederation , then , no State could legally annul a decision of the Congress or refuse to submit to its execution but no provision was made to enforce these decisions . Congress made requisitions , but they were not complied with . The Government could not operate on individuals . They had no judiciary , no means of collecting revenue . But the defects of the Confederation need not be detailed . Under its operation we could scarcely be called a nation . We had neither prosperity at home nor consideration abroad . This state of things could not be endured , and our present happy Constitution was formed , but formed in vain if this fatal doctrine prevails . It was formed for important objects that are announced in the preamble , made in the name and by the authority of the people of the United States , whose delegates framed and whose conventions approved it . The most important among these objects that which is placed first in rank , on which all the others rest is to form a more perfect union . Now , is it possible that even if there were no express provision giving supremacy to the Constitution and laws of the United States over those of the States , can it be conceived that an instrument made for the purpose of forming a more perfect union than that of the Confederation could be so constructed by the assembled wisdom of our country as to substitute for that Confederation a form of government dependent for its existence on the local interest , the party spirit , of a State , or of a prevailing faction in a State Every man of plain , unsophisticated understanding who hears the question will give such an answer as will preserve the Union . Metaphysical subtlety , in pursuit of an impracticable theory , could alone have devised one that is calculated to destroy it . I consider , then , the power to annul a law of the United States , assumed by one State , incompatible with the existence of the Union , contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution , unauthorized by its spirit , inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded , and destructive of the great object far which it was formed . After this general view of the leading principle , we must examine the particular application of it which is made in the ordinance . The preamble rests its justification on these grounds It assumes as a fact that the obnoxious laws , although they purport to be laws for raising revenue , were in reality intended for the protection of manufactures , which purpose it asserts to be unconstitutional that the operation of these laws is unequal that the amount raised by them is greater than is required by the wants of the Government and , finally , that the proceeds are to be applied to objects unauthorized by the Constitution . These are the only causes alleged to justify an open opposition to the laws of the country and a threat of seceding from the Union if any attempt should be made to enforce them . The first virtually acknowledges that the law in question was passed under a power expressly given by the Constitution to lay and collect imposts but its constitutionality is drawn in question from the motives of those who passed it . However apparent this purpose may be in the present case , nothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that an unconstitutional purpose entertained by the members who assent to a law enacted under a constitutional power shall make that law void . For how is that purpose to be ascertained Who is to make the scrutiny How often may bad purposes be falsely imputed , in how many cases are they concealed by false professions , in how many is no declaration of motive made Admit this doctrine , and you give to the States an uncontrolled right to decide , and every law may be annulled under this pretext . If , therefore , the absurd and dangerous doctrine should be admitted that a State may annul an unconstitutional law , or one that it deems such , it will not apply to the present case . . The next objection is that the laws in question operate unequally . This objection may be made with truth to every law that has been or can be passed . The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality . If the unequal operation of a law makes it unconstitutional , and if all laws of that description may be abrogated by any State for that cause , then , indeed , is the Federal Constitution unworthy of the slightest effort for its preservation . We have hitherto relied on it as the perpetual bond of our Union we have received it as the work of the assembled wisdom of the nation we have trusted to it as to the sheet anchor of our safety in the stormy times of conflict with a foreign or domestic foe we have looked to it with sacred awe as the palladium of our liberties , and with all the solemnities of religion have pledged to each other our lives and fortunes here and our hopes of happiness hereafter in its defense and support . Were we mistaken , my countrymen , in attaching this importance to the Constitution of our country Was our devotion paid to the wretched , inefficient , clumsy contrivance which this new doctrine would make it Did we pledge ourselves to the support of an airy nothing a bubble that must be blown away by the first breath of disaffection Was this self destroying , visionary theory the work of the profound statesmen , the exalted patriots , to whom the task of constitutional reform was intrusted Did the name of Washington sanction , did the States deliberately ratify , such an anomaly in the history of fundamental legislation No we were not mistaken . The letter of this great instrument is free from this radical fault . Its language directly contradicts the imputation its spirit , its evident intent , contradicts it . No we did not err . Our Constitution does not contain the absurdity of giving power to make laws and another to resist them . The sages whose memory will always be reverenced have given us a practical and , as they hoped , a permanent constitutional compact . The Father of his Country did not affix his revered name to so palpable an absurdity . Nor did the States , when they severally ratified it , do so under the impression that a veto on the laws of the United States was reserved to them or that they could exercise it by implication . Search the debates in all their conventions , examine the speeches of the most zealous opposers of Federal authority , look at the amendments that were proposed they are all silent not a syllable uttered , not a vote given , not a motion made to correct the explicit supremacy given to the laws of the Union over those of the States , or to show that implication , as is now contended , could defeat it . No we have not erred . The Constitution is still the object of our reverence , the bond of our Union , our defense in danger , the source of our prosperity in peace . It shall descend , as we have received it , uncorrupted by sophistical construction , to our posterity and the sacrifices of local interest , of State prejudices , of personal animosities , that were made to bring it into existence , will again be patriotically offered for its support . The two remaining objections made by the ordinance to these laws are that the sums intended to be raised by them are greater than are required and that the proceeds will be unconstitutionally employed . The Constitution has given , expressly , to Congress the right of raising revenue and of determining the sum the public exigencies will require . The States have no control over the exercise of this right other than that which results from the power of changing the representatives who abuse it , and thus procure redress . Congress may undoubtedly abuse this discretionary power but the same may be said of others with which they are vested . Yet the discretion must exist somewhere . The Constitution has given it to the representatives of all the people , checked by the representatives of the States and by the Executive power . The South Carolina construction gives it to the legislature or the convention of a single State , where neither the people of the different States , nor the States in their separate capacity , nor the Chief Magistrate elected by the people have any representation . Which is the most discreet disposition of the power I do not ask you , fellow citizens , which is the constitutional disposition that instrument speaks a language not to be misunderstood . But if you were assembled in general convention , which would you think the safest depository of this discretionary power in the last resort Would you add a clause giving it to each of the States , or would you sanction the wise provisions already made by your Constitution If this should be the result of your deliberations when providing for the future , are you , can you , be ready to risk all that we hold dear , to establish , for a temporary and a local purpose , that which you must acknowledge to be destructive , and even absurd , as a general provision Carry out the consequences of this right vested in the different States , and you must perceive that the crisis your conduct presents at this day would recur whenever any law of the United States displeased any of the States , and that we should soon cease to be a nation . The ordinance , with the same knowledge of the future that characterizes a former objection , tells you that the proceeds of the tax will be unconstitutionally applied If this could be ascertained with certainty , the objection would with more propriety be reserved for the law so applying the proceeds , but surely can not be urged against the laws levying the duty . These are the allegations contained in the ordinance . Examine them seriously , my fellow citizens judge for yourselves . I appeal to you to determine whether they are so clear , so convincing , as to leave no doubt of their correctness and even if you should come to this conclusion , how far they justify the reckless , destructive course which you are directed to pursue . Review these objections and the conclusions drawn from them once more . What are they Every law , then , for raising revenue , according to the South Carolina ordinance , may be rightfully annulled , unless it be so framed as no law ever will or can be framed . Congress have a right to pass laws for raising revenue and each State have a right to oppose their execution two rights directly opposed to each other and yet is this absurdity supposed to be contained in an instrument drawn for the express purpose of avoiding collisions between the States and the General Government by an assembly of the most enlightened statesmen and purest patriots ever embodied for a similar purpose . In vain have these sages declared that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises in vain have they provided that they shall have power to pass laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry those powers into execution , that those laws and that Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land , and that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding in vain have the people of the several States solemnly sanctioned these provisions , made them their paramount law , and individually sworn to support them whenever they were called on to execute any office . Vain provisions ineffectual restrictions vile profanation of oaths miserable mockery of legislation if a bare majority of the voters in any one State may , on a real or supposed knowledge of the intent with which a law has been passed , declare themselves free from its operation say , here it gives too little , there , too much , and operates unequally here it suffers articles to be free that ought to be taxed there it taxes those that ought to be free in this case the proceeds are intended to be applied to purposes which we do not approve in that , the amount raised is more than is wanted . Congress , it is true , are invested by the Constitution with the right of deciding these questions according to their sound discretion . Congress is composed of the representatives of all the States and of all the people of all the States . But we , part of the people of one State , to whom the Constitution has given no power on the subject , from whom it has expressly taken it away we , who have solemnly agreed that this Constitution shall be our law we , most of whom have sworn to support it we now abrogate this law and swear , and force others to swear , that it shall not be obeyed and we do this not because Congress have no right to pass such laws this we do not allege but because they have passed them with improper views . They are unconstitutional from the motives of those who passed them , which we can never with certainty know from their unequal operation , although it is impossible , from the nature of things , that they should be equal and from the disposition which we presume may be made of their proceeds , although that disposition has not been declared . This is the plain meaning of the ordinance in relation to laws which it abrogates for alleged unconstitutionality . But it does not stop there . It repeals in express terms an important part of the Constitution itself and of laws passed to give it effect , which have never been alleged to be unconstitutional . The Constitution declares that the judicial powers of the United States extend to cases arising under the laws of the United States , and that such laws , the Constitution , and treaties shall be paramount to the State constitutions and laws . The judiciary act prescribes the mode by which the case may be brought before a court of the United States by appeal when a State tribunal shall decide against this provision of the Constitution . The ordinance declares there shall be no appeal makes the State law paramount to the Constitution and laws of the United States , forces judges and jurors to swear that they will disregard their provisions , and even makes it penal in a suitor to attempt relief by appeal . It further declares that it shall not be lawful for the authorities of the United States or of that State to enforce the payment of duties imposed by the revenue laws within its limits . Here is a law of the United States , not even pretended to be unconstitutional , repealed by the authority of a small majority of the voters of a single State . Here is a provision of the Constitution which is solemnly abrogated by the same authority . On such expositions and reasonings the ordinance grounds not only an assertion of the right to annul the laws of which it complains , but to enforce it by a threat of seceding from the Union if any attempt is made to execute them . This right to secede is deduced from the nature of the Constitution , which , they say , is a compact between sovereign States who have preserved their whole sovereignty and therefore are subject to no superior that because they made the compact they can break it when in their opinion it has been departed from by the other States . Fallacious as this course of reasoning is , it enlists State pride and finds advocates in the honest prejudices of those who have not studied the nature of our Government sufficiently to see the radical error on which it rests . The people of the United States formed the Constitution , acting through the State legislatures in making the compact , to meet and discuss its provisions , and acting in separate conventions when they ratified those provisions but the terms used in its construction show it to be a Government in which the people of all the States , collectively , are represented . We are one people in the choice of President and Vice President . Here the States have no other agency than to direct the mode in which the votes shall be given . The candidates having the majority of all the votes are chosen . The electors of a majority of States may have given their votes for one candidate , and yet another may be chosen . The people , then , and not the States , are represented in the executive branch . In the House of Representatives there is this difference , that the people of one State do not , as in the case of President and Vice President , all vote for the same officers . The people of all the States do not vote for all the members , each State electing only its own representatives . But this creates no material distinction . When chosen , they are all representatives of the United States , not representatives of the particular State from which they come . They are paid by the United States , not by the State nor are they accountable to it for any act done in the performance of their legislative functions and however they may in practice , as it is their duty to do , consult and prefer the interests of their particular constituents when they come in conflict with any other partial or local interest , yet it is their first and highest duty , as representatives of the United States , to promote the general good . The Constitution of the United States , then , forms a government , not a league and whether it be formed by compact between the States or in any other manner , its character is the same . It is a Government in which all the people are represented , which operates directly on the people individually , not upon the States they retained all the power they did not grant . But each State , having expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute , jointly with the other States , a single nation , can not , from that period , possess any right to secede , because such secession does not break a league , but destroys the unity of a nation and any injury to that unity is not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact , but it is an offense against the whole Union . To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States are not a nation , because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts , to their injury or ruin , without committing any offense . Secession , like any other revolutionary act , may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression but to call it a constitutional right is confounding the meaning of terms , and can only be done through gross error or to deceive those who are willing to assert a right , but would pause before they made a revolution or incur the penalties consequent on a failure . Because the Union was formed by a compact , it is said the parties to that compact may , when they feel themselves aggrieved , depart from it but it is precisely because it is a compact that they can not . A compact is an agreement or binding obligation . It may by its terms have a sanction or penalty for its breach , or it may not . If it contains no sanction , it may be broken with no other consequence than moral guilt if it have a sanction , then the breach incurs the designated or implied penalty . A league between independent nations generally has no sanction other than a moral one or if it should contain a penalty , as there is no common superior it can not be enforced . A government , on the contrary , always has a sanction , express or implied and in our case it is both necessarily implied and expressly given . An attempt , by force of arms , to destroy a government is an offense , by whatever means the constitutional compact may have been formed and such government has the right by the law of self defense to pass acts for punishing the offender , unless that right is modified , restrained , or resumed by the constitutional act . In our system , although it is modified in the case of treason , yet authority is expressly given to pass all laws necessary to carry its powers into effect , and under this grant provision has been made for punishing acts which obstruct the due administration of the laws . It would seem superfluous to add anything to show the nature of that union which connects us , but as erroneous opinions on this subject are the foundation of doctrines the most destructive to our peace , I must give some further development to my views on this subject . No one , fellow citizens , has a higher reverence for the reserved rights of the States than the Magistrate who now addresses you . No one would make greater personal sacrifices or official exertions to defend them from violation but equal care must be taken to prevent , on their part , an improper interference with or resumption of the rights they have vested in the nation . The line has not been so distinctly drawn as to avoid doubts in some cases of the exercise of power . Men of the best intentions and soundest views may differ in their construction of some parts of the Constitution but there are others on which dispassionate reflection can leave no doubt . Of this nature appears to be the assumed right of secession . It rests , as we have seen , on the alleged undivided sovereignty of the States and on their having formed in this sovereign capacity a compact which is called the Constitution , from which , because they made it , they have the right to secede . Both of these positions are erroneous , and some of the arguments to prove them so have been anticipated . The States severally have not retained their entire sovereignty . It has been shown that in becoming parts of a nation , not members of a league , they surrendered many of their essential parts of sovereignty . The right to make treaties , declare war , levy taxes , exercise exclusive judicial and legislative powers , were all of them functions of sovereign power . The States , then , for all these important purposes were no longer sovereign . The allegiance of their citizens was transferred , in the first instance , to the Government of the United States they became American citizens and owed obedience to the Constitution of the United States and to laws made in conformity with the powers it vested in Congress . This last position has not been and can not be denied . How , then , can that State be said to be sovereign and independent whose citizens owe obedience to laws not made by it and whose magistrates are sworn to disregard those laws when they come in conflict with those passed by another What shows conclusively that the States can not be said to have reserved an undivided sovereignty is that they expressly ceded the right to punish treason not treason against their separate power , but treason against the United States . Treason is an offense against sovereignty , and sovereignty must reside with the power to punish it . But the reserved rights of the States are not less sacred because they have , for their common interest , made the General Government the depository of these powers . The unity of our political character as has been shown for another purpose commenced with its very existence . Under the royal Government we had no separate character our opposition to its oppressions began as united colonies . We were the United States under the Confederation , and the name was perpetuated and the Union rendered more perfect by the Federal Constitution . In none of these stages did we consider ourselves in any other light than as forming one nation . Treaties and alliances were made in the name of all . Troops were raised for the joint defense . How , then , with all these proofs that under all changes of our position we had , for designated purposes and with defined powers , created national governments , how is it that the most perfect of those several modes of union should now be considered as a mere league that may be dissolved at pleasure It is from an abuse of terms . Compact is used as synonymous with league , although the true term is not employed , because it would at once show the fallacy of the reasoning . It would not do to say that our Constitution was only a league , but it is labored to prove it a compact which in one sense it is and then to argue that as a league is a compact every compact between nations must of course be a league , and that from such an engagement every sovereign power has a right to recede . But it has been shown that in this sense the States are not sovereign , and that even if they were , and the national Constitution had been formed by compact , there would be no right in any one State to exonerate itself from its obligations . So obvious are the reasons which forbid this secession that it is necessary only to allude to them . The Union was formed for the benefit of all . It was produced by mutual sacrifices of interests and opinions . Can those sacrifices be recalled Can the States who magnanimously surrendered their title to the territories of the West recall the grant Will the inhabitants of the inland States agree to pay the duties that may be imposed without their assent by those on the Atlantic or the Gulf for their own benefit Shall there be a free port in one State and onerous duties in another No one believes that any right exists in a single State to involve all the others in these and countless other evils contrary to engagements solemnly made . Everyone must see that the other States , in self defense , must oppose it at all hazards . These are the alternatives that are presented by the convention a repeal of all the acts for raising revenue , leaving the Government without the means of support , or an acquiescence in the dissolution of our Union by the secession of one of its members . When the first was proposed , it was known that it could not be listened to for a moment . It was known , if force was applied to oppose the execution of the laws , that it must be repelled by force that Congress could not , without involving itself in disgrace and the country in ruin , accede to the proposition and yet if this is not done in a given day , or if any attempt is made to execute the laws , the State is by the ordinance declared to be out of the Union . The majority of a convention assembled for the purpose have dictated these terms , or rather this rejection of all terms , in the name of the people of South Carolina . It is true that the governor of the State speaks of the submission of their grievances to a convention of all the States , which , he says , they sincerely and anxiously seek and desire . Yet this obvious and constitutional mode of obtaining the sense of the other States on the construction of the federal compact , and amending it if necessary , has never been attempted by those who have urged the State on to this destructive measure . The State might have proposed the call for a general convention to the other States , and Congress , if a sufficient number of them concurred , must have called it . But the first magistrate of South Carolina , when he expressed a hope that on a review by Congress and the functionaries of the General Government of the merits of the controversy such a convention will be accorded to them , must have known that neither Congress nor any functionary of the General Government has authority to call such a convention unless it be demanded by two thirds of the States . This suggestion , then , is another instance of the reckless inattention to the provisions of the Constitution with which this crisis has been madly hurried on , or of the attempt to persuade the people that a constitutional remedy had been sought and refused . If the legislature of South Carolina anxiously desire a general convention to consider their complaints , why have they not made application for it in the way the Constitution points out The assertion that they earnestly seek it is completely negatived by the omission . This , then , is the position in which we stand A small majority of the citizens of one State in the Union have elected delegates to a State convention that convention has ordained that all the revenue laws of the United States must be repealed , or that they are no longer a member of the Union . The governor of that State has recommended to the legislature the raising of an army to carry the secession into effect , and that he may be empowered to give clearances to vessels in the name of the State . No act of violent opposition to the laws has yet been committed , but such a state of things is hourly apprehended . And it is the intent of this instrument to proclaim , not only that the duty imposed on me by the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed shall be performed to the extent of the powers already vested in me by law , or of such others as the wisdom of Congress shall devise and intrust to me for that purpose , but to warn the citizens of South Carolina who have been deluded into an opposition to the laws of the danger they will incur by obedience to the illegal and disorganizing ordinance of the convention to exhort those who have refused to support it to persevere in their determination to uphold the Constitution and laws of their country and to point out to all the perilous situation into which the good people of that State have been led , and that the course they are urged to pursue is one of ruin and disgrace to the very State whose rights they affect to support . Fellow citizens of my native State , let me not only admonish you , as the First Magistrate of our common country , not to incur the penalty of its laws , but use the influence that a father would over his children whom he saw rushing to certain ruin . In that paternal language , with that paternal feeling , let me tell you , my countrymen , that you are deluded by men who are either deceived themselves or wish to deceive you . Mark under what pretenses you have been led on to the brink of insurrection and treason on which you stand . First , a diminution of the value of your staple commodity , lowered by overproduction in other quarters , and the consequent diminution in the value of your lands were the sole effect of the tariff laws . The effect of those laws was confessedly injurious , but the evil was greatly exaggerated by the unfounded theory you were taught to believe that its burthens were in proportion to your exports , not to your consumption of imported articles . Your pride was roused by the assertion that a submission to those laws was a state of vassalage and that resistance to them was equal in patriotic merit to the opposition our fathers offered to the oppressive laws of Great Britain . You were told that this opposition might be peaceably , might be constitutionally , made that you might enjoy all the advantages of the Union and bear none of its burthens . Eloquent appeals to your passions , to your State pride , to your native courage , to your sense of real injury , were used to prepare you for the period when the mask which concealed the hideous features of disunion should be taken off . It fell , and you were made to look with complacency on objects which not long since you would have regarded with horror . Look back to the arts which have brought you to this state look forward to the consequences to which it must inevitably lead Look back to what was first told you as an inducement to enter into this dangerous course . The great political truth was repeated to you that you had the revolutionary right of resisting all laws that were palpably unconstitutional and intolerably oppressive . It was added that the right to nullify a law rested on the same principle , but that it was a peaceable remedy . This character which was given to it made you receive with too much confidence the assertions that were made of the unconstitutionality of the law and its oppressive effects . Mark , my fellow citizens , that by the admission of your leaders the unconstitutionality must be palpable , or it will not justify either resistance or nullification . What is the meaning of the word palpable in the sense in which it is here used That which is apparent to everyone that which no man of ordinary intellect will fail to perceive . Is the unconstitutionality of these laws of that description Let those among your leaders who once approved and advocated the principle of protective duties answer the question and let them choose whether they will be considered as incapable then of perceiving that which must have been apparent to every man of common understanding , or as imposing upon your confidence and endeavoring to mislead you now . In either case they are unsafe guides in the perilous path they urge you to tread . Ponder well on this circumstance , and you will know how to appreciate the exaggerated language they address to you . They are not champions of liberty , emulating the fame of our Revolutionary fathers , nor are you an oppressed people , contending , as they repeat to you , against worse than colonial vassalage . You are free members of a flourishing and happy Union . There is no settled design to oppress you . You have indeed felt the unequal operation of laws which may have been unwisely , not unconstitutionally , passed but that inequality must necessarily be removed . At the very moment when you were madly urged on to the unfortunate course you have begun a change in public opinion had commenced . The nearly approaching payment of the public debt and the consequent necessity of a diminution of duties had already produced a considerable reduction , and that , too , on some articles of general consumption in your State . The importance of this change was underrated , and you were authoritatively told that no further alleviation of your burthens was to be expected at the very time when the condition of the country imperiously demanded such a modification of the duties as should reduce them to a just and equitable scale . But , as if apprehensive of the effect of this change in allaying your discontents , you were precipitated into the fearful state in which you now find yourselves . I have urged you to look back to the means that were used to hurry you on to the position you have now assumed and forward to the consequences it will produce . Something more is necessary . Contemplate the condition of that country of which you still form an important part . Consider its Government , uniting in one bond of common interest and general protection so many different States , giving to all their inhabitants the proud title of American citizen , protecting their commerce , securing their literature and their arts , facilitating their intercommunication , defending their frontiers , and making their name respected in the remotest parts of the earth . Consider the extent of its territory , its increasing and happy population , its advance in arts which render life agreeable , and the sciences which elevate the mind See education spreading the lights of religion , morality , and general information into every cottage in this wide extent of our Territories and States . Behold it as the asylum where the wretched and the oppressed find a refuge and support . Look on this picture of happiness and honor and say , We too are citizens of America . Carolina is one of these proud States her arms have defended , her best blood has cemented , this happy Union . And then add , if you can , without horror and remorse , This happy Union we will dissolve this picture of peace and prosperity we will deface this free intercourse we will interrupt these fertile fields we will deluge with blood the protection of that glorious flag we renounce the very name of Americans we discard . And for what , mistaken men For what do you throw away these inestimable blessings For what would you exchange your share in the advantages and honor of the Union For the dream of a separate independence a dream interrupted by bloody conflicts with your neighbors and a vile dependence on a foreign power . If your leaders could succeed in establishing a separation , what would be your situation Are you united at home Are you free from the apprehension of civil discord , with all its fearful consequences Do our neighboring republics , every day suffering some new revolution or contending with some new insurrection , do they excite your envy But the dictates of a high duty oblige me solemnly to announce that you can not succeed . The laws of the United States must be executed . I have no discretionary power on the subject my duty is emphatically pronounced in the Constitution . Those who told you that you might peaceably prevent their execution deceived you they could not have been deceived themselves . They know that a forcible opposition could alone prevent the execution of the laws , and they know that such opposition must be repelled . Their object is disunion . But be not deceived by names . Disunion by armed force is treason . Are you really ready to incur its guilt If you are , on the heads of the instigators of the act be the dreadful consequences on their heads be the dishonor , but on yours may fall the punishment . On your unhappy State will inevitably fall all the evils of the conflict you force upon the Government of your country . It can not accede to the mad project of disunion , of which you would be the first victims . Its First Magistrate can not , if he would , avoid the performance of his duty . The consequence must be fearful for you , distressing to your fellow citizens here and to the friends of good government throughout the world . Its enemies have beheld our prosperity with a vexation they could not conceal it was a standing refutation of their slavish doctrines , and they will point to our discord with the triumph of malignant joy . It is yet in your power to disappoint them . There is yet time to show that the descendants of the Pinckneys , the Sumpters , the Rutledges , and of the thousand other names which adorn the pages of your Revolutionary history will not abandon that Union to support which so many of them fought and bled and died . I adjure you , as you honor their memory , as you love the cause of freedom , to which they dedicated their lives , as you prize the peace of your country , the lives of its best citizens , and your own fair fame , to retrace your steps . Snatch from the archives of your State the disorganizing edict of its convention bid its members to reassemble and promulgate the decided expressions of your will to remain in the path which alone can conduct you to safety , prosperity , and honor . Tell them that compared to disunion all other evils are light , because that brings with it an accumulation of all . Declare that you will never take the field unless the star spangled banner of your country shall float over you that you will not be stigmatized when dead , and dishonored and scorned while you live , as the authors of the first attack on the Constitution of your country . Its destroyers you can not be . You may disturb its peace , you may interrupt the course of its prosperity , you may cloud its reputation for stability but its tranquillity will be restored , its prosperity will return , and the stain upon its national character will be transferred and remain an eternal blot on the memory of those who caused the disorder . Fellow citizens of the United States , the threat of unhallowed disunion , the names of those once respected by whom it is uttered , the array of military force to support it , denote the approach of a crisis in our affairs on which the continuance of our unexampled prosperity , our political existence , and perhaps that of all free governments may depend . The conjuncture demanded a free , a full , and explicit enunciation , not only of my intentions , but of my principles of action and as the claim was asserted of a right by a State to annul the laws of the Union , and even to secede from it at pleasure , a frank exposition of my opinions in relation to the origin and form of our Government and the construction I give to the instrument by which it was created seemed to be proper . Having the fullest confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of my duties which has been expressed , I rely with equal confidence on your undivided support in my determination to execute the laws , to preserve the Union by all constitutional means , to arrest , if possible , by moderate and firm measures the necessity of a recourse to force and if it be the will of Heaven that the recurrence of its primeval curse on man for the shedding of a brother s blood should fall upon our land , that it be not called down by any offensive act on the part of the United States . Fellow citizens , the momentous case is before you . On your undivided support of your Government depends the decision of the great question it involves whether your sacred Union will be preserved and the blessing it secures to us as one people shall be perpetuated . No one can doubt that the unanimity with which that decision will be expressed will be such as to inspire new confidence in republican institutions , and that the prudence , the wisdom , and the courage which it will bring to their defense will transmit them unimpaired and invigorated to our children . May the Great Ruler of Nations grant that the signal blessings with which He has favored ours may not , by the madness of party or personal ambition , be disregarded and lost and may His wise providence bring those who have produced this crisis to see the folly before they feel the misery of civil strife , and inspire a returning veneration for that Union which , if we may dare to penetrate His designs , He has chosen as the only means of attaining the high destinies to which we may reasonably aspire . In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed , having signed the same with my hand . Done at the city of Washington , this 10th day of December , 1832 , and of the Independence of the United States the fifty seventh . ANDREW JACKSON . By the President EDLIVINGSTON , Secretary of State .<speech_sep>Fellow citizens The will of the American people , expressed through their unsolicited suffrages , calls me before you to pass through the solemnities preparatory to taking upon myself the duties of President of the United States for another term . For their approbation of my public conduct through a period which has not been without its difficulties , and for this renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions , I am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude . It shall be displayed to the extent of my humble abilities in continued efforts so to administer the government as to preserve their liberty and promote their happiness . So many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called forth sometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painful my views of the principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the general government that I need on this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them . The foreign policy adopted by our government soon after the formation of our present Constitution , and very generally pursued by successive administrations , has been crowned with almost complete success , and has elevated our character among the nations of the earth . To do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none has been during my administration its governing maxim , and so happy have been its results that we are not only at peace with all the world , but have few causes of controversy , and those of minor importance , remaining unadjusted . In the domestic policy of this government there are two objects which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representatives , and which have been and will continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude . They are the preservation of the rights of the several states and the integrity of the union . These great objects are necessarily connected , and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed . To this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted , and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several states and of the United States which the people themselves have ordained for their own government . My experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me , that the destruction of our state governments or the annihilation of their control over the local concerns of the people would lead directly to revolution and anarchy , and finally to despotism and military domination . In proportion , therefore , as the general government encroaches upon the rights of the states , in the same proportion does it impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the purposes of its creation . Solemnly impressed with these considerations , my countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional powers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the rights of the states or tend to consolidate all political power in the general government . But of equal , and , indeed , of incalculable , importance is the union of these states , and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the general government in the exercise of its just powers . You have been wisely admonished to accustom yourselves to think and speak of the union as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity , watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety , discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned , and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts . Without union our independence and liberty would never have been achieved without union they never can be maintained . Divided into 24 , or even a smaller number , of separate communities , we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints and exactions communication between distant points and sections obstructed or cut off our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now till in peace the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies , and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming our lawgivers and judges . The loss of liberty , of all good government , of peace , plenty , and happiness , must inevitably follow a dissolution of the union . In supporting it , therefore , we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist . The time at which I stand before you is full of interest . The eyes of all nations are fixed on our republic . The event of the existing crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government . Great is the stake placed in our hands great is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the United States . Let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world . Let us exercise forbearance and firmness . Let us extricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate . Deeply impressed with the truth of these observations , and under the obligation of that solemn oath which I am about to take , I shall continue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the Constitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of our federal union . At the same time , it will be my aim to inculcate by my official acts the necessity of exercising by the general government those powers only that are clearly delegated to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditures of the government to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these objects , and in a manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the community and of all portions of the union . Constantly bearing in mind that in entering into society individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest , it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise , and , by reconciling our fellow citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a greater good , to recommend our invaluable government and union to the confidence and affections of the American people . Finally , it is my most fervent prayer to that Almighty Being before whom I now stand , and who has kept us in His hands from the infancy of our republic to the present day , that He will so overrule all my intentions and actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow citizens that we may be preserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and happy people .<speech_sep>The bill to modify and continue the act entitled An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States was presented to me on the 4th July instant . Having considered it with that solemn regard to the principles of the Constitution which the day was calculated to inspire , and come to the conclusion that it ought not to become a law , I herewith return it to the Senate , in which it originated , with my objections . A bank of the United States is in many respects convenient for the Government and useful to the people . Entertaining this opinion , and deeply impressed with the belief that some of the powers and privileges possessed by the existing bank are unauthorized by the Constitution , subversive of the rights of the States , and dangerous to the liberties of the people , I felt it my duty at an early period of my Administration to call the attention of Congress to the practicability of organizing an institution combining all its advantages and obviating these objections . I sincerely regret that in the act before me I can perceive none of those modifications of the bank charter which are necessary , in my opinion , to make it compatible with justice , with sound policy , or with the Constitution of our country . The present corporate body , denominated the president , directors , and company of the Bank of the United States , will have existed at the time this act is intended to take effect twenty years . It enjoys an exclusive privilege of banking under the authority of the General Government , a monopoly of its favor and support , and , as a necessary consequence , almost a monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchange . The powers privileges , and favors bestowed upon it in the original charter , by increasing the value of the stock far above its par value , operated as a gratuity of many millions to the stockholders . An apology may be found for the failure to guard against this result in the consideration that the effect of the original act of incorporation could not be certainly foreseen at the time of its passage . The act before me proposes another gratuity to the holders of the same stock , and in many cases to the same men , of at least seven millions more . This donation finds no apology in any uncertainty as to the effect of the act . On all hands it is conceded that its passage will increase at least 20 or 30 per cent more the market price of the stock , subject to the payment of the annuity of 200 , 000 per year secured by the act , thus adding in a moment one fourth to its par value . It is not our own citizens only who are to receive the bounty of our Government . More than eight millions of the stock of this bank are held by foreigners . By this act the American Republic proposes virtually to make them a present of some millions of dollars . For these gratuities to foreigners and to some of our own opulent citizens the act secures no equivalent whatever . They are the certain gains of the present stockholders under the operation of this act , after making full allowance for the payment of the bonus . Every monopoly and all exclusive privileges are granted at the expense of the public , which ought to receive a fair equivalent . The many millions which this act proposes to bestow on the stockholders of the existing bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earnings of the American people . It is due to them , therefore , if their Government sell monopolies and exclusive privileges , that they should at least exact for them as much as they are worth in open market . The value of the monopoly in this case may be correctly ascertained . The twenty eight millions of stock would probably be at an advance of 50 per cent , and command in market at least 42 , 000 , 000 , subject to the payment of the present bonus . The present value of the monopoly , therefore , is 17 , 000 , 000 , and this the act proposes to sell for three millions , payable in fifteen annual installments of 200 , 000 each . It is not conceivable how the present stockholders can have any claim to the special favor of the Government . The present corporation has enjoyed its monopoly during the period stipulated in the original contract . If we must have such a corporation , why should not the Government sell out the whole stock and thus secure to the people the full market value of the privileges granted Why should not Congress create and sell twenty eight millions of stock , incorporating the purchasers with all the powers and privileges secured in this act and putting the premium upon the sales into the Treasury But this act does not permit competition in the purchase of this monopoly . It seems to be predicated on the erroneous idea that the present stockholders have a prescriptive right not only to the favor but to the bounty of Government . It appears that more than a fourth part of the stock is held by foreigners and the residue is held by a few hundred of our own citizens , chiefly of the richest class . For their benefit does this act exclude the whole American people from competition in the purchase of this monopoly and dispose of it for many millions less than it is worth . This seems the less excusable because some of our citizens not now stockholders petitioned that the door of competition might be opened , and offered to take a charter on terms much more favorable to the Government and country . But this proposition , although made by men whose aggregate wealth is believed to be equal to all the private stock in the existing bank , has been set aside , and the bounty of our Government is proposed to be again bestowed on the few who have been fortunate enough to secure the stock and at this moment wield the power of the existing institution . I can not perceive the justice or policy of this course . If our Government must sell monopolies , it would seem to be its duty to take nothing less than their full value , and if gratuities must be made once in fifteen or twenty years let them not be bestowed on the subjects of a foreign government nor upon a designated and favored class of men in our own country . It is but justice and good policy , as far as the nature of the case will admit , to confine our favors to our own fellow citizens , and let each in his turn enjoy an opportunity to profit by our bounty . In the bearings of the act before me upon these points I find ample reasons why it should not become a law . It has been urged as an argument in favor of rechartering the present bank that the calling in its loans will produce great embarrassment and distress . The time allowed to close its concerns is ample , and if it has been well managed its pressure will be light , and heavy only in case its management has been bad . If , therefore , it shall produce distress , the fault will be its own , and it would furnish a reason against renewing a power which has been so obviously abused . But will there ever be a time when this reason will be less powerful To acknowledge its force is to admit that the bank ought to be perpetual , and as a consequence the present stockholders and those inheriting their rights as successors be established a privileged order , clothed both with great political power and enjoying immense pecuniary advantages from their connection with the Government . The modifications of the existing charter proposed by this act are not such , in my view , as make it consistent with the rights of the States or the liberties of the people . The qualification of the right of the bank to hold real estate , the limitation of its power to establish branches , and the power reserved to Congress to forbid the circulation of small notes are restrictions comparatively of little value or importance . All the objectionable principles of the existing corporation , and most of its odious features , are retained without alleviation . The fourth section provides that the notes or bills of the said corporation , although the same be , on the faces thereof , respectively made payable at one place only , shall nevertheless be received by the said corporation at the bank or at any of the offices of discount and deposit thereof if tendered in liquidation or payment of any balance or balances due to said corporation or to such office of discount and deposit from any other incorporated bank . This provision secures to the State banks a legal privilege in the Bank of the United States which is withheld from all private citizens . If a State bank in Philadelphia owe the Bank of the United States and have notes issued by the Louis branch , it can pay the debt with those notes , but if a merchant , mechanic , or other private citizen be in like circumstances he can not by law pay his debt with those notes , but must sell them at a discount or send them to Louis to be cashed . This boon conceded to the State banks , though not unjust in itself , is most odious because it does not measure out equal justice to the high and the low , the rich and the poor . To the extent of its practical effect it is a bond of union among the banking establishments of the nation , erecting them into an interest separate from that of the people , and its necessary tendency is to unite the Bank of the United States and the State banks in any measure which may be thought conducive to their common interest . The ninth section of the act recognizes principles of worse tendency than any provision of the present charter . It enacts that the cashier of the bank shall annually report to the Secretary of the Treasury the names of all stockholders who are not resident citizens of the United States , and on the application of the treasurer of any State shall make out and transmit to such treasurer a list of stockholders residing in or citizens of such State , with the amount of stock owned by each . Although this provision , taken in connection with a decision of the Supreme Court , surrenders , by its silence , the right of the States to tax the banking institutions created by this corporation under the name of branches throughout the Union , it is evidently intended to be construed as a concession of their right to tax that portion of the stock which may be held by their own citizens and residents . In this light , if the act becomes a law , it will be understood by the States , who will probably proceed to levy a tax equal to that paid upon the stock of banks incorporated by themselves . In some States that tax is now 1 per cent , either on the capital or on the shares , and that may be assumed as the amount which all citizen or resident stockholders would be taxed under the operation of this act . As it is only the stock held in the States and not that employed within them which would be subject to taxation , and as the names of foreign stockholders are not to be reported to the treasurers of the States , it is obvious that the stock held by them will be exempt from this burden . Their annual profits will therefore be 1 per cent more than the citizen stockholders , and as the annual dividends of the bank may be safely estimated at 7 per cent , the stock will be worth 10 or 15 per cent more to foreigners than to citizens of the United States . To appreciate the effects which this state of things will produce , we must take a brief review of the operations and present condition of the Bank of the United States . By documents submitted to Congress at the present session it appears that on the 1st of January , 1832 , of the twenty eight millions of private stock in the corporation , 8 , 405 , 500 were held by foreigners , mostly of Great Britain . The amount of stock held in the nine Western and Southwestern States is 140 , 200 , and in the four Southern States is 5 , 623 , 100 , and in the Middle and Eastern States is about 13 , 522 , 000 . The profits of the bank in 1831 , as shown in a statement to Congress , were about 3 , 455 , 598 of this there accrued in the nine Western States about 1 , 640 , 048 in the four Southern States about 352 , 507 , and in the Middle and Eastern States about 1 , 463 , 041 . As little stock is held in the West , it is obvious that the debt of the people in that section to the bank is principally a debt to the Eastern and foreign stockholders that the interest they pay upon it is carried into the Eastern States and into Europe , and that it is a burden upon their industry and a drain of their currency , which no country can bear without inconvenience and occasional distress . To meet this burden and equalize the exchange operations of the bank , the amount of specie drawn from those States through its branches within the last two years , as shown by its official reports , was about 6 , 000 , 000 . More than half a million of this amount does not stop in the Eastern States , but passes on to Europe to pay the dividends of the foreign stockholders . In the principle of taxation recognized by this act the Western States find no adequate compensation for this perpetual burden on their industry and drain of their currency . The branch bank at Mobile made last year 95 , 140 , yet under the provisions of this act the State of Alabama can raise no revenue from these profitable operations , because not a share of the stock is held by any of her citizens . Mississippi and Missouri are in the same condition in relation to the branches at Natchez and Louis , and such , in a greater or less degree , is the condition of every Western State . The tendency of the plan of taxation which this act proposes will be to place the whole United States in the same relation to foreign countries which the Western States now bear to the Eastern . When by a tax on resident stockholders the stock of this bank is made worth 10 or 15 per cent more to foreigners than to residents , most of it will inevitably leave the country . Thus will this provision in its practical effect deprive the Eastern as well as the Southern and Western States of the means of raising a revenue from the extension of business and great profits of this institution . It will make the American people debtors to aliens in nearly the whole amount due to this bank , and send across the Atlantic from two to five millions of specie every year to pay the bank dividends . In another of its bearings this provision is fraught with danger . Of the twenty five directors of this bank five are chosen by the Government and twenty by the citizen stockholders . From all voice in these elections the foreign stockholders are excluded by the charter . In proportion , therefore , as the stock is transferred to foreign holders the extent of suffrage in the choice of directors is curtailed . Already is almost a third of the stock in foreign hands and not represented in elections . It is constantly passing out of the country , and this act will accelerate its departure . The entire control of the institution would necessarily fall into the hands of a few citizen stockholders , and the ease with which the object would be accomplished would be a temptation to designing men to secure that control in their own hands by monopolizing the remaining stock . There is danger that a president and directors would then be able to elect themselves from year to year , and without responsibility or control manage the whole concerns of the bank during the existence of its charter . It is easy to conceive that great evils to our country and its institutions might flow from such a concentration of power in the hands of a few men irresponsible to the people . Is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance . Should its influence become concentered , as it may under the operation of such an act as this , in the hands of a self elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders , will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves , they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation . But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges , it can not be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence . Should the stock of the bank principally pass into the hands of the subjects of a foreign country , and we should unfortunately become involved in a war with that country , what would be our condition Of the course which would be pursued by a bank almost wholly owned by the subjects of a foreign power , and managed by those whose interests , if not affections , would run in the same direction there can be no doubt . All its operations within would be in aid of the hostile fleets and armies without . Controlling our currency , receiving our public moneys , and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence , it would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy . If we must have a bank with private stockholders , every consideration of sound policy and every impulse of American feeling admonishes that it should be purely American . Its stockholders should be composed exclusively of our own citizens , who at least ought to be friendly to our Government and willing to support it in times of difficulty and danger . So abundant is domestic capital that competition in subscribing for the stock of local banks has recently led almost to riots . To a bank exclusively of American stockholders , possessing the powers and privileges granted by this act , subscriptions for 200 , 000 , 000 could be readily obtained . Instead of sending abroad the stock of the bank in which the Government must deposit its funds and on which it must rely to sustain its credit in times of emergency , it would rather seem to be expedient to prohibit its sale to aliens under penalty of absolute forfeiture . It is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its constitutionality in all its features ought to be considered as settled by precedent and by the decision of the Supreme Court . To this conclusion I can not assent . Mere precedent is a dangerous source of authority , and should not be regarded as deciding questions of constitutional power except where the acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered as well settled . So far from this being the case on this subject , an argument against the bank might be based on precedent . One Congress , in 1791 , decided in favor of a bank another , in 1811 , decided against it . One Congress , in 1815 , decided against a bank another , in 1816 , decided in its favor . Prior to the present Congress , therefore , the precedents drawn from that source were equal . If we resort to the States , the expressions of legislative , judicial , and executive opinions against the bank have been probably to those in its favor as 4 to 1 . There is nothing in precedent , therefore , which , if its authority were admitted , ought to weigh in favor of the act before me . If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole ground of this act , it ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this Government . The Congress , the Executive , and the Court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution . Each public officer who takes an oath to support the Constitution swears that he will support it as he understands it , and not as it is understood by others . It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives , of the Senate , and of the President to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be presented to them for passage or approval as it is of the supreme judges when it may be brought before them for judicial decision . The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges , and on that point the President is independent of both . The authority of the Supreme Court must not , therefore , be permitted to control the Congress or the Executive when acting in their legislative capacities , but to have only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve . But in the case relied upon the Supreme Court have not decided that all the features of this corporation are compatible with the Constitution . It is true that the court have said that the law incorporating the bank is a constitutional exercise of power by Congress but taking into view the whole opinion of the court and the reasoning by which they have come to that conclusion , I understand them to have decided that inasmuch as a bank is an appropriate means for carrying into effect the enumerated powers of the General Government , therefore the law incorporating it is in accordance with that provision of the Constitution which declares that Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying those powers into execution . Having satisfied themselves that the word necessary in the Constitution means needful , requisite , essential , conducive to , and that a bank is a convenient , a useful , and essential instrument in the prosecution of the Government s fiscal operations , they conclude that to use one must be within the discretion of Congress and that the act to incorporate the Bank of the United States is a law made in pursuance of the Constitution but , say they , where the law is not prohibited and is really calculated to effect any of the objects intrusted to the Government , to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department and to tread on legislative ground . The principle here affirmed is that the degree of its necessity , involving all the details of a banking institution , is a question exclusively for legislative consideration . A bank is constitutional , but it is the province of the Legislature to determine whether this or that particular power , privilege , or exemption is necessary and proper to enable the bank to discharge its duties to the Government , and from their decision there is no appeal to the courts of justice . Under the decision of the Supreme Court , therefore , it is the exclusive province of Congress and the President to decide whether the particular features of this act are necessary and proper in order to enable the bank to perform conveniently and efficiently the public duties assigned to it as a fiscal agent , and therefore constitutional , or unnecessary and improper , and therefore unconstitutional . Without commenting on the general principle affirmed by the Supreme Court , let us examine the details of this act in accordance with the rule of legislative action which they have laid down . It will be found that many of the powers and privileges conferred on it can not be supposed necessary for the purpose for which it is proposed to be created , and are not , therefore , means necessary to attain the end in view , and consequently not justified by the Constitution . The original act of incorporation , section 21 , enacts that no other bank shall be established by any future law of the United States during the continuance of the corporation hereby created , for which the faith of the United States is hereby pledged Provided , Congress may renew existing charters for banks within the District of Columbia not increasing the capital thereof , and may also establish any other bank or banks in said District with capitals not exceeding in the whole 6 , 000 , 000 if they shall deem it expedient . This provision is continued in force by the act before me fifteen years from the 3d of March , 1836 . If Congress possessed the power to establish one bank , they had power to establish more than one if in their opinion two or more banks had been necessary to facilitate the execution of the powers delegated to them in the Constitution . If they possessed the power to establish a second bank , it was a power derived from the Constitution to be exercised from time to time , and at any time when the interests of the country or the emergencies of the Government might make it expedient . It was possessed by one Congress as well as another , and by all Congresses alike , and alike at every session . But the Congress of 1816 have taken it away from their successors for twenty years , and the Congress of 1832 proposes to abolish it for fifteen years more . It can not be necessary or proper for Congress to barter away or divest themselves of any of the powers vested in them by the Constitution to be exercised for the public good . It is not necessary to the efficiency of the bank , nor is it proper in relation to themselves and their successors . They may properly use the discretion vested in them , but they may not limit the discretion of their successors . This restriction on themselves and grant of a monopoly to the bank is therefore unconstitutional . In another point of view this provision is a palpable attempt to amend the Constitution by an act of legislation . The Constitution declares that the Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District of Columbia . Its constitutional power , therefore , to establish banks in the District of Columbia and increase their capital at will is unlimited and uncontrollable by any other power than that which gave authority to the Constitution . Yet this act declares that Congress shall not increase the capital of existing banks , nor create other banks with capitals exceeding in the whole 6 , 000 , 000 . The Constitution declares that Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation over this District in all cases whatsoever , and this act declares they shall not . Which is the supreme law of the land This provision can not be necessary or proper or constitutional unless the absurdity be admitted that whenever it be necessary and proper in the opinion of Congress they have a right to barter away one portion of the powers vested in them by the Constitution as a means of executing the rest . On two subjects only does the Constitution recognize in Congress the power to grant exclusive privileges or monopolies . It declares that Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . Out of this express delegation of power have grown our laws of patents and copyrights . As the Constitution expressly delegates to Congress the power to grant exclusive privileges in these cases as the means of executing the substantive power to promote the progress of science and useful arts , it is consistent with the fair rules of construction to conclude that such a power was not intended to be granted as a means of accomplishing any other end . On every other subject which comes within the scope of Congressional power there is an ever living discretion in the use of proper means , which can not be restricted or abolished without an amendment of the Constitution . Every act of Congress , therefore , which attempts by grants of monopolies or sale of exclusive privileges for a limited time , or a time without limit , to restrict or extinguish its own discretion in the choice of means to execute its delegated powers is equivalent to a legislative amendment of the Constitution , and palpably unconstitutional . This act authorizes and encourages transfers of its stock to foreigners and grants them an exemption from all State and national taxation . So far from being necessary and proper that the bank should possess this power to make it a safe and efficient agent of the Government in its fiscal operations , it is calculated to convert the Bank of the United States into a foreign bank , to impoverish our people in time of peace , to disseminate a foreign influence through every section of the Republic , and in war to endanger our independence . The several States reserved the power at the formation of the Constitution to regulate and control titles and transfers of real property , and most , if not all , of them have laws disqualifying aliens from acquiring or holding lands within their limits . But this act , in disregard of the undoubted right of the States to prescribe such disqualifications , gives to aliens stockholders in this bank an interest and title , as members of the corporation , to all the real property it may acquire within any of the States of this Union . This privilege granted to aliens is not necessary to enable the bank to perform its public duties , nor in any sense proper , because it is vitally subversive of the rights of the States . The Government of the United States have no constitutional power to purchase lands within the States except for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings , and even for these objects only by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be . By making themselves stockholders in the bank and granting to the corporation the power to purchase lands for other purposes they assume a power not granted in the Constitution and grant to others what they do not themselves possess . It is not necessary to the receiving , safe keeping , or transmission of the funds of the Government that the bank should possess this power , and it is not proper that Congress should thus enlarge the powers delegated to them in the Constitution . The old Bank of the United States possessed a capital of only 11 , 000 , 000 , which was found fully sufficient to enable it with dispatch and safety to perform all the functions required of it by the Government . The capital of the present bank is 35 , 000 , 000 at least twenty four more than experience has proved to be necessary to enable a bank to perform its public functions . The public debt which existed during the period of the old bank and on the establishment of the new has been nearly paid off , and our revenue will soon be reduced . This increase of capital is therefore not for public but for private purposes . The Government is the only proper judge where its agents should reside and keep their offices , because it best knows where their presence will be necessary . It can not , therefore , be necessary or proper to authorize the bank to locate branches where it pleases to perform the public service , without consulting the Government , and contrary to its will . The principle laid down by the Supreme Court concedes than Congress can not establish a bank for purposes of private speculation and gain , but only as a means of executing the delegated powers . of the General Government . By the same principle a branch bank can not constitutionally be established for other than public purposes . The power which this act gives to establish two branches in any State , without the injunction or request of the Government and for other than public purposes , is not necessary to the due execution of the powers delegated to Congress . The bonus which is exacted from the bank is a confession upon the face of the act that the powers granted by it are greater than are necessary to its character of a fiscal agent . The Government does not tax its officers and agents for the privilege of serving it . The bonus of a million and a half required by the original charter and that of three millions proposed by this act are not exacted for the privilege of giving the necessary facilities for transferring the public funds from place to place within the United States or the Territories thereof , and for distributing the same in payment of the public creditors without charging commission or claiming allowance on account of the difference of exchange , as required by the act of incorporation , but for something more beneficial to the stockholders . The original act declares that it the bonus is granted in consideration of the exclusive privileges and benefits conferred by this act upon the said bank , and the act before me declares it to be in consideration of the exclusive benefits and privileges continued by this act to the said corporation for fifteen years , as aforesaid . It is therefore for exclusive privileges and benefits conferred for their own use and emolument , and not for the advantage of the Government , that a bonus is exacted . These surplus powers for which the bank is required to pay can not surely be necessary to make it the fiscal agent of the Treasury . If they were , the exaction of a bonus for them would not be proper . It is maintained by some that the bank is a means of executing the constitutional power to coin money and regulate the value thereof . Congress have established a mint to coin money and passed laws to regulate the value thereof . The money so coined , with its value so regulated , and such foreign coins as Congress may adopt are the only currency known to the Constitution . But if they have other power to regulate the currency , it was conferred to be exercised by themselves , and not to be transferred to a corporation . If the bank be established for that purpose , with a charter unalterable without its consent , Congress have parted with their power for a term of years , during which the Constitution is a dead letter . It is neither necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank , and therefore unconstitutional . By its silence , considered in connection with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of McCulloch against the State of Maryland , this act takes from the States the power to tax a portion of the banking business carried on within their limits , in subversion of one of the strongest barriers which secured them against Federal encroachment . Banking , like farming , manufacturing , or any other occupation or profession , is a business , the right to follow which is not originally derived from the laws . Every citizen and every company of citizens in all of our States possessed the right until the State legislatures deemed it good policy to prohibit private banking by law . If the prohibitory State laws were now repealed , every citizen would again possess the right . The State banks are a qualified restoration of the right which has been taken away by the laws against banking , guarded by such provisions and limitations as in the opinion of the State legislatures the public interest requires . These corporations , unless there be an exemption in their charter , are , like private bankers and banking companies , subject to State taxation . The manner in which these taxes shall be laid depends wholly on legislative discretion . It may be upon the bank , upon the stock , upon the profits , or in any other mode which the sovereign power shall will . Upon the formation of the Constitution the States guarded their taxing power with peculiar jealousy . They surrendered it only as it regards imports and exports . In relation to every other object within their jurisdiction , whether persons , property , business , or professions , it was secured in as ample a manner as it was before possessed . All persons , though United States officers , are liable to a poll tax by the States within which they reside . The lands of the United States are liable to the usual land tax , except in the new States , from whom agreements that they will not tax unsold lands are exacted when they are admitted into the Union . Horses , wagons , any beasts or vehicles , tools , or property belonging to private citizens , though employed in the service of the United States , are subject to State taxation . Every private business , whether carried on by an officer of the General Government or not , whether it be mixed with public concerns or not , even if it be carried on by the Government of the United States itself , separately or in partnership , falls within the scope of the taxing power of the State . Nothing comes more fully within it than banks and the business of banking , by whomsoever instituted and carried on . Over this whole subject matter it is just as absolute , unlimited , and uncontrollable as if the Constitution had never been adopted , because in the formation of that instrument it was reserved without qualification . The principle is conceded that the States can not rightfully tax the operations of the General Government . They can not tax the money of the Government deposited in the State banks , nor the agency of those banks in remitting it but will any man maintain that their mere selection to perform this public service for the General Government would exempt the State banks and their ordinary business from State taxation Had the United States , instead of establishing a bank at Philadelphia , employed a private banker to keep and transmit their funds , would it have deprived Pennsylvania of the right to tax his bank and his usual banking operations It will not be pretended . Upon what principle , then , are the banking establishments of the Bank of the United States and their usual banking operations to be exempted from taxation It is not their public agency or the deposits of the Government which the States claim a right to tax , but their banks and their banking powers , instituted and exercised within State jurisdiction for their private emolument those powers and privileges for which they pay a bonus , and which the States tax in their own banks . The exercise of these powers within a State , no matter by whom or under what authority , whether by private citizens in their original right , by corporate bodies created by the States , by foreigners or the agents of foreign governments located within their limits , forms a legitimate object of State taxation . From this and like sources , from the persons , property , and business that are found residing , located , or carried on under their jurisdiction , must the States , since the surrender of their right to raise a revenue from imports and exports , draw all the money necessary for the support of their governments and the maintenance of their independence . There is no more appropriate subject of taxation than banks , banking , and bank stocks , and none to which the States ought more pertinaciously to cling . It can not be necessary to the character of the bank as a fiscal agent of the Government that its private business should be exempted from that taxation to which all the State banks are liable , nor can I conceive it proper that the substantive and most essential powers reserved by the States shall be thus attacked and annihilated as a means of executing the powers delegated to the General Government . It may be safely assumed that none of those sages who had an agency in forming or adopting our Constitution ever imagined that any portion of the taxing power of the States not prohibited to them nor delegated to Congress was to be swept away and annihilated as a means of executing certain powers delegated to Congress . If our power over means is so absolute that the Supreme Court will not call in question the constitutionality of an act of Congress the subject of which is not prohibited , and is really calculated to effect any of the objects intrusted to the Government , although , as in the case before me , it takes away powers expressly granted to Congress and rights scrupulously reserved to the States , it becomes us to proceed in our legislation with the utmost caution . Though not directly , our own powers and the rights of the States may be indirectly legislated away in the use of means to execute substantive powers . We may not enact that Congress shall not have the power of exclusive legislation over the District of Columbia , but we may pledge the faith of the United States that as a means of executing other powers it shall not be exercised for twenty years or forever . We may not pass an act prohibiting the States to tax the banking business carried on within their limits , but we may , as a means of executing our powers over other objects , place that business in the hands of our agents and then declare it exempt from State taxation in their hands . Thus may our own powers and the rights of the States , which we can not directly curtail or invade , be frittered away and extinguished in the use of means employed by us to execute other powers . That a bank of the United States , competent to all the duties which may be required by the Government , might be so organized as not to infringe on our own delegated powers or the reserved rights of the States I do not entertain a doubt . Had the Executive been called upon to furnish the project of such an institution , the duty would have been cheerfully performed . In the absence of such a call it was obviously proper that he should confine himself to pointing out those prominent features in the act presented which in his opinion make it incompatible with the Constitution and sound policy . A general discussion will now take place , eliciting new light and settling important principles and a new Congress , elected in the midst of such discussion , and furnishing an equal representation of the people according to the last census , will bear to the Capitol the verdict of public opinion , and , I doubt not , bring this important question to a satisfactory result . Under such circumstances the bank comes forward and asks a renewal of its charter for a term of fifteen years upon conditions which not only operate as a gratuity to the stockholders of many millions of dollars , but will sanction any abuses and legalize any encroachments . Suspicions are entertained and charges are made of gross abuse and violation of its charter . An investigation unwillingly conceded and so restricted in time as necessarily to make it incomplete and unsatisfactory discloses enough to excite suspicion and alarm . In the practices of the principal bank partially unveiled , in the absence of important witnesses , and in numerous charges confidently made and as yet wholly uninvestigated there was enough to induce a majority of the committee of investigation a committee which was selected from the most able and honorable members of the House of Representatives to recommend a suspension of further action upon the bill and a prosecution of the inquiry . As the charter had yet four years to run , and as a renewal now was not necessary to the successful prosecution of its business , it was to have been expected that the bank itself , conscious of its purity and proud of its character , would have withdrawn its application for the present , and demanded the severest scrutiny into all its transactions . In their declining to do so there seems to be an additional reason why the functionaries of the Government should proceed with less haste and more caution in the renewal of their monopoly . The bank is professedly established as an agent of the executive branch of the Government , and its constitutionality is maintained on that ground . Neither upon the propriety of present action nor upon the provisions of this act was the Executive consulted . It has had no opportunity to say that it neither needs nor wants an agent clothed with such powers and favored by such exemptions . There is nothing in its legitimate functions which makes it necessary or proper . Whatever interest or influence , whether public or private , has given birth to this act , it can not be found either in the wishes or necessities of the executive department , by which present action is deemed premature , and the powers conferred upon its agent not only unnecessary , but dangerous to the Government and country . It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes . Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government . Equality of talents , of education , or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions . In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry , economy , and virtue , every man is equally entitled to protection by law but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions , to grant titles , gratuities , and exclusive privileges , to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful , the humble members of society the farmers , mechanics , and laborers who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves , have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government . There are no necessary evils in government . Its evils exist only in its abuses . If it would confine itself to equal protection , and , as Heaven does its rains , shower its favors alike on the high and the low , the rich and the poor , it would be an unqualified blessing . In the act before me there seems to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principles . Nor is our Government to be maintained or our Union preserved by invasions of the rights and powers of the several States . In thus attempting to make our General Government strong we make it weak . Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to themselves in making itself felt , not in its power , but in its beneficence not in its control , but in its protection not in binding the States more closely to the center , but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper orbit . Experience should teach us wisdom . Most of the difficulties our Government now encounters and most of the dangers which impend over our Union have sprung from an abandonment of the legitimate objects of Government by our national legislation , and the adoption of such principles as are embodied in this act . Many of our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits , but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress . By attempting to gratify their desires we have in the results of our legislation arrayed section against section , interest against interest , and man against man , in a fearful commotion which threatens to shake the foundations of our Union . It is time to pause in our career to review our principles , and if possible revive that devoted patriotism and spirit of compromise which distinguished the sages of the Revolution and the fathers of our Union . If we can not at once , in justice to interests vested under improvident legislation , make our Government what it ought to be , we can at least take a stand against all new grants of monopolies and exclusive privileges , against any prostitution of our Government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many , and in favor of compromise and gradual reform in our code of laws and system of political economy . I have now done my duty to my country . If sustained by my fellow citizens , I shall be grateful and happy if not , I shall find in the motives which impel me ample grounds for contentment and peace . In the difficulties which surround us and the dangers which threaten our institutions there is cause for neither dismay nor alarm . For relief and deliverance let us firmly rely on that kind Providence which I am sure watches with peculiar care over the destinies of our Republic , and on the intelligence and wisdom of our countrymen . Through His abundant goodness and their patriotic devotion our liberty and Union will be preserved .<speech_sep>
